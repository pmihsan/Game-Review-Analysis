started main menu hell empty corridor gets filled characters instead get boring glitter filled purple main menu screen okay maybe im overreacting main menu game looks horrible reason played original persona side side original one looked waaay better reason cool ambient lighting got removed whatnot higher resolution graphics also damaged game since see low poly really huge letdownnow dont get wrong im still going finish see new content im sure small changes made worth removed nostalgia seriesget original version havent played get real experience look whats worth mostly good adaptation happy finally got play game things experienced playing game rather watching played however one glaring problem version suffers whenever animated cutscene plays audio visuals stutter constantly really take experience order actually watch mute game play cutscene phone huge problem desperately needs fixed look negative review comes qualifiers game good im enjoying although ive really gotten point actually opens lets play story interesting like combat world english vas good least less annoying japanese ones however marked glaring technical flaws im pretty sure come port game deals memory admit laptop basically potato years past retirement would expect run game fine actual game however constant audio stuttering freezing crashing cutscenes unnacceptable battle pc wouldnt work spaceship expect infinite loading screens forcing quit game might ok except theres autosave even manual dungeons expect playing hours idiots ported didnt think people cant afford computer looking cool jo wait fuck wrong game looking forward seeing kanji swimsuit question looks great even though tearing still tiny bit present even vsync expected really buy game youre looking challenge isnt first smt play hard love persona sadly cant play due constant random crashes horrible cutscene lag fix review negative otherwise great game cant recommend someone risk buying itedit changed positive recommendation every

uma perfeita entre visualnovel e jrpg que quanto maior rank seu sociallink com os outros personagens mais fortes personas que criar te dando uma grande vantagem na parte jrpg jogo jogo transborda estilo e personalidade assim como os outros da serie e trilha sonora excelentea jogabilidade para sua batalha por turnos porem serie persona tem sistema de fraqueza nos inimigos em que se vc acertar os elementais certos vc ganha um turno mais e se todos os inimigos forem acertados com suas respectivas fraquezas jogador pode desferir um allout attack que causa dano massivo oponente normalmente eliminando inimigo na hora que faz combate ser mais interessante que os outros negativo jogo que ele vem com denuvo programa contra pirataria que um programa infame que pesa bastante computador e ate em maquinas com specs muito maiores que recomendado causa umas pequeninas travadinhas em certas partes realmente um milagre ver persona golden pc pois serie sempre foi ligada ao playstation e como ele
