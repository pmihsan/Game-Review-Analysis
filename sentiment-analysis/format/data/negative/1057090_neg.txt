gripes chase escape sequences rather short comparison first game escape kuro ginso tree oris combat abilities interesting enemies could use variation opinion perhaps mini bosses heavy type enemies like gorleks despite possible bugs may run even frustration parts incredible game movement feels fluid crazy things done boss fights interesting mechanics especially final boss done easily devs end oris story natural way instead storytelling failure even need explain works directly forum instead letting players feel gameplay enjoy first installment game enjoy map exploration segmented areas

give refunds buy game easily one best metroidvanias ive ever played right hollow knight rough part game first boss hide corner wait get close hit twice repeat process boring really bad way introduce boss fights player bad part game though rest game fantastic edit since people keep saying im bad game made make clear first recommend game youd expect sequel beautiful graphics characters easily worth pricebut point ive mind since playing first game tiny flaws game grinds gearsunfortunately game inherited biggest weaknesses original game first minor annoyances control due complex geometryfor example climb wall little ramp makes character fall said wall extra annoying falling wall counts using jump cannot double jump like youd expect sometimes little bump wall make dash abruptly without warning maybe spikes enemies sometimes climb ledge onto flat ground character pops air bit instead dropping onto ground screw counts using jumpanother minor annoyance enemies attacks really designed outplayed skillful controls theyre predictable often feels like button mashing attacks superior dps better trying avoid enemy attacks projectiles targeted adjust aim consecutive shot lets say theres spider shoots three consecutive bursts spider shoots ground im standing dodge first shot jumping jump according timing next shot spider aimed midair first jump second shot comes air instead ground hitting another example crawling bug shoots three spikes almost impossible consistently dodge pointblank covers every angle approach idea one three going targeted either best strategy kill enough clicks attack youthird one enemies hit touching even theyre stunned cannot dash enemies either makes unable play aggresively dash past enemy get behind dash get enemies face land finisher einfach nur fantastisch ich war begeistert vom ersten teil ich bin begeistert vom zweiten man kann sich streiten welcher nun besser ist aber das ist einfach nur spielt beide mich die besten games die es nur gibt epic games beautiful visuals great controls tight fun fast paced platforming interesting combat many combat options fans hollow knght liek game great music nice story would buy es un juego hermoso en todo aspecto desde lo visual hasta la banda sonora jugabilidad gran progreso en al anterior ori blind forest even better first game first game damn fantastic even though bit short absolutely amazing definitely goty contender ever since bought game ninjas sneaking house cutting onions everything game screams immense polisheven first ori game big featbasically youve gotta play excellent game emphasis combat movement complexity ori blind forestthe game quite bit longer well completionistssimilarly previous game art music story magnificent excellent game built basis wellknown predecessor ori blind forestoris mobility insane title movement environments smooth art music excellent expectedthe weakness previous title combats gone various weapons choose enjoyable way true delight playmy complain ori small times making difficult see screenone advice go buy play ori first didnt already excellent game completed thoroughly hours game play visuals soundtrack great simple story lot heart technical problems stuttering major audio problems final area needed restart game solve however minor compared enjoyment got game excellent sequel original game much indepth combat options equally emotional story excellent story gameplay cant miss exceptional followup first game added new elements without making feel like missed part original tough moved game slowly still wish playtime dont know lack content enjoyable id gladly play expansion continuation franchise extremely bad play design point unplayable realised late cannot get refund nowedit believe search ori wisps escape giant sand worm youtube passed dev testing astounding extremely beautiful levels designed consistently interesting mechanic ever overstays welcome emotional moments well gameplayheavy game extremely touching end sad see ori gone lives fantastic visualsbest soundtrackemotional rollercoasteri cried lot fantastic game part incredible presentationonly cons felt fighting enemies little hard follow much going screen boss battle really liked last one fantastic game finished normal mode finished second time hard mode play sure must platform game enthusiast fantastic game fixed minor gripes first game traditional boss fights lack melee combat thing really complain game achievements full energy one dont seem registering complete overall game amazing first time side scrolling game really wowd graphics years wish longer like hollow knight hopefully get cool dlc near future fantastic sequel blind forest game play feels great game world large art stunning fast paced fluid occasionally frustrating platforming game gorgeous styling sound fast fluid utterly engaging general traversal however could also said original game wotw add keep things freshthe answer combat first seems like great idea practice proves little variety standard enemy types see another big dude club skin overall difficulty balance feels like complete mess overly difficult terms game encourages play checkpoint system original removed replaced withnothing means throw fights platforming reckless abandon need thought strategy damn shame early hours looked promising introduction involved melee approach combat essentially biggest overarching gripe entire game incredibly difficult get invested upgrade paths systems punished slightest incredibly lazy play point might wondering ticked recommend box despite overarching complaints still arent enough ruin well sour movement still feels sublime particular insanely detailed animations interacting objects swinging sword add gorgeous layer polish backgrounds art general stunning actual level design still competent throughout handful decent bosses still get overshadowed much effective escape sequences return first game overall game isnt total disappointment success innovations undermined heavily questionable design choices regarding checkpoints upgrades mostly rides triumphs original certainly far poor game would least come tempered expectations feeling empty finished game feels familiar enough first game adding new ideas never feels boring exploration always feels good bit confused ending ride along way good gets platformer games days hit feelz like ori nothing bad say game finished game hard mode god damn battle frustration tearsa worthy successor ori blind forest plus additions stolen lets say hollow knightat point days release quite lot bugs sounds gradually played fewer fewer points leave actual play areathe biggest problem game controls dont wanna spoil anything later game sequence another run boss died many times ori simply didnt dash direction telling controller go nonetheless pricevalue ratiohighly recommended first game perfect played times loved every single time one completely screwed terms key bindings key mechanics windows many new functions limited keys assign pressing q cant assign specials key want problem half time keys respond action high end keyboard thats issue games took example times yes try pass spider fight blue flower would circle around time use grapple despite close guess times work exact spot died burrow stupidly fast movements seem balanced toooooo fast many bad decisions went game overall disappointed recommend original already edit arrived worm part thats enough game uninstalled first foremost important state ori wisps good game right yet dont recommend anyone played ori blind forest found poor sequel every regardtldrrant rant game feels like hollow knight dressed ori ok game good sequel either regards mechanics storyatmosphere aesthetics lets face defining components ori games personally admit buying first game came across ost listening music youtube got hooked pure awesomeness music game purchased reason nierautomata regret decisionsand jump problems music ori wisps jus wasnt appealing great ambient music lacked impact first game felt generic even recycled melodies previous installment felt meh graphics similar feeling old designs carried looked great new enemies example felt years since played first game cant tell exactly new models fit handdrawn visual style environmentbut whats worse many graphic designs felt like things changed sake changing cant say better mean point changing light soultree blue yellow sure looks awful like really awful last one npcs include effect gameplay less atmosphere first game mostly sein talking rare interactions dead spirits absolute minimal number alive npcs critical story completely overturned random interactable npcs litter whole forest niwen player never really feals struggle alone narrative splintered interactions often absolutely pointless inclusion sidequests make even worse especially considering minimal compensation spoileronly good side quest father looking family player finds stone bodies mother child tells father leaves area turn stone next really impactful small element player likely notice unless keenly aware wish quests worked like sadly spoilergameplay set new movement skills game allow even greater freedom movement control scheme awful true lasso digging dash really aimed skill aiming cause frustration joy speaking mouse keyboard controls aim truly deceiving sometimes always towards mouse pointer whats worse mouse pointer direction fighting multiple enemies near multiple similarly interactable objects randomize result player try catch incoming projectile grab dangerous enemy instead taking damage try flee jump fray instead recognize moderately well though conversion controller controls still fun parts first game chase sequences well gone really almost shorter much less dramatic bring frustration challenge originally could done first try quick thinking situational awareness well anymore first game clear way obstacles often multiple footholds offered player decides make jump bit longer shorter lenght intended developers could mean loss round floors crumbling soon player almost lands becomes thing boss catching randomly wrong location chosen apparent reason trial error finding plant hook platform land etc much less emphasis placed precise execution instead chases boss fights god player fight several bosses really meaningless large creatures barely get know main one included thrown arena bash move yes played game hard played first one difficulty well far know bosses reasonable lower difficulties easier reasonable ill explain mean take complaint bosses massive health pools sponges incredible variety spam attacks combined small windows damaging retaliation almost certain retaliation still hard though

jagged edges compared everything else fact grapple bash bound thing default unchangeable controller leads lot accidental deaths damage taken game thinks want grapple something instead bashing projectile vice versa spirit shard enabling grapple enemies also sometimes allows bash grappling liked first one powers friends zonesgreat music great story difficult platformingthere however negtives spoil abilitys get herethe fact grapple bash well burrow dash button respectively causes unexpected behavior sometimes gone crisp platforming blind forest want bash enemy bad game thinks want grapple shoots skythis even worse dash burrow button often time leaves sitting wall wanted burrow especialy bad one later bosses die repeadedly thismore abilitys fun many different movement options bound button causes frustrationsalso weird bug sounds one boss werent playing quick restart fixed however liked first one totally get second one didnt even take minutes story suck bring right back sense

holding right left background sometimes blocks vision character completely countless deaths due context sensitive controls working worst part game far spirit shards meaningless fighting bosses mandatory gems socket take slots ie sticky triple jump magnet auto save system confusing disoriented respawning sure items get saved recollect old saving system ori great menus mess playing still keep hitting wrong buttons trying cancel trying change upgrade etc checking map always one button press keep last zoom level checking map single button time sand movement feels terrible cases accuracy

dialogue explanation found quite sad conflicted end ending satisfyingthe art style game topnotchi appreciated game provided way obtain items fairly simply spent lot time tracking secrets couldnt get could come back later using screenshots ultimately proved unnecessary though let power greatly much earlier oni quite frustrated though often game crashed lot research seemed many issues closer launch cant understand almost year later game many issues sometimes play hours problem sometimes ill get three crashes ten minutes odd reason progressed game experienced less crashes point nonethere also minor graphical glitches ori standing specific places vibrate happens sometimes cutscenes fairly distractingeven frustrating crashes game worth game awasome really recomend tis game anyone play blind

wonderfully crafted visuals music narrative even everything comes together make awesome game one stay long time game easily goty one complaint direction story went fact main antagonist giant evil bird

bad soon entered wellspring fix game hard beautifulworld size variety also excellent cant say enemy varietycontrols tight issuessound get messy break occasionallyi still enjoyed immensely though game action platformer game far since ori blind forest game obviously beautiful strong aesthetics game play good strong dislike singular aspect otherwise beautiful game storythe amount backtracking plain tiresome lost count number times backtrack whoever level design moon studios needs take lesson ux frustrating travel way one area platformer go back finish another quest first point side quests cant even access even worse multiple areas finally clear hours exploring get water mill running secondary blockage preventing exploring aforementioned areas leading even backtracking another example spent gorlek ores early clear path cave find cant explore without light design game frustrating possible refuse reward players worked hard find work even give option explore want instead dead end blocked paths immersion gets killed forced stare map time instead exploring recommend game game phenomenal last years mostly fastpaced multiplayer games ori wisps first episode blind forest kept hooked whole campaign graphics artwork music gameplay sublime regret getting game game shit gameplay wise unless like dark souls shit bosses dont follow patterns dont signal attacks singal two different attacks way attacks cant dodge cant deal dmg without taking dmg bcz hitbox larger boss cant lower difficulty cant exit game without loosing progress boss platformer agility challenge game beautiful gameplay fun used shit platformers im addicted game beautiful everything perfect cried times thats okay game fucking good game looks beautiful music incredible controls movement butter smooth story made ugly cry like three times would recommend game made cry tt game makes forget coronavirus game makes want kill game needs played people small company shaming hell triple industry game seems good reviews
