gear making easier harder start new regions got new region gear gonna hard start doable perfectly rolled legendary gear maybe could skip straight enemies would behave enemies original regioninstead artifacts increasing riding gliding sailing etc reins boat glider etc obtained adjacent areas better old ones old ones dont magically disappear upon entering new area yet getting feels worthwhile would feel really good find say reins different regions ride around ludicrous speedsfor matter make artifacts give mechanical upgrades rather insignificant qol upgrades like currently longer rolling distance longer invulnerability frames higher jumping max stamina increase basically things cant get trough gear land items like reins boat glider actually feel like artifacts getting alot doesnt make attacks make bigger numbers make character feel better play longer combos jumping larger chasms rolling trough multiple attackseven enemy player damage enemies dont feel like sponges dont feel like

nonarmourweapons zones would able explore world like also legend quest give something like instead make worthwhile find allsecond items make toggle switch one items zonelocked another makes starting zone level adjacent zones go level pr star rating becomes harder go away world centre tldr topthank time get cube world vanilla classic cuz current version shit version way better cant believe game scrapped make monstrosity game likely abandoned shell alpha cant even bothered writing proper review read others would avoid cost cant even kill snail right bat cash grab updates since release youve warned caveat start would say neutral review leaning towards recommend slightly cube world interesting game released years ago bought played lot completely forgot existence time surprising suddenly popped radar late august current state cube world poor still playable region lock interesting mechanic never seen wont say bad gear exists kinda extends gameplay feels bad man way make progress get gear clear zone suddenly unless weapon go back trash tier struggling kill greys greens tier mobs final kicker artifacts get completing zones might well exist due benefits give neigh useless two relics got play time stamina drain per second diving instead base unnoticeable lantern size increase honestly two things arent bad seem granted arent good mechanics really bad annoying honestly worst part game way gear weapon damage works play experience friends us alpha players water mages ranger water mages simply dont really care weapons much every class spam tornadoes lasers feet staves wands healing constantly racking combo counter much faster rate starter bow able compared ranger would get combo counter every second luckyone thing note going combo counter means everything miss even single hit resets unless weapon multi hit need graze enemy single hit keep rolling higher combo counter damage penetrate armor first hours gameplay found mage warrior rogue weapons single ranger weapon entire time time fighting purple mobs still wandering around starting weapon damage anything still glorified sand trap cool walked around group killed purple crab boss say maybe damage course boss health dropped gold boomerang suddenly even little else way gear could fight kill almost everything ease level power variance incredibly frustrating simply rely rng get upgrade maybe class maybe friends classes playing players add onto fact unless ranger struggle kill white mobs starting required get gear unless get carried get lucky farm ores craft weapon starting game horrible grind unrewarding straight fun clear first zone better even tho gear technically worthless unless piece still better geartldr review game good state could salvaged current state game recommend honesty one guys play said best group like dev took alpha stripped everything made fun adding depth puddle breadth ocean content factionsquesting eliminated progression threw outnever completed features teased years feels little scam release game state steamall even getting devs track record essentially putting something ditching years depending perspective almost complete lack communication fronts personally worried release real intention fixingcompleting game yet calling full release deletion bug report forms deletion dev blog deletion proposedplannedimplement dev build things shortly game went full release changed massively shown alpha negative wayregion locked gear means theres permanent progress artifacts almost bearingbiomes mostly samey youve visited game exhausted changed game played completely hate fact area need gather specific items equipment every new area resets back square levelsperksskills set stuff pretty upset classic example dont fix isnt broken clearly hype game massively undeserved disappointment clicker games less repetitive game shame really alpha highlighted potential game beta somehow took away added developers twitter also shown numerous things present game today think developer said fuck trying cash game comes back gives sad story releases game worse alpha make progression fun made unnecessarily difficult meet friends coming original alpha literally miles ahead today combat feels clunky difficult wrong reasons theres reason actively explore kill random enemies especially considering skills dont travel region region quests dont seem sense scaling sending death without real reason class skills strange real way understand without hunting guide absolutely patch notes upon updatesto honest dont even bother would say wait update obvious wollay taken money ran second time likely get refund update change broken game never come coming game blind trying experience first hand without playing beta make new players self seem confused whats going players randomly spawn world either waking town island forest objective leaving new players confused coming across first enemy near starting zone spawned youd think would low levels go attack outcome getting two shot themonce respawning already frustrated youve already killed something low level area deaths realise game level system monsters fight either grind gear lose interest due game feeling like rushed release hasnt even properly developed anyway opinion game communication stopped soon game released least twittercash grabperfectly designed steal money compared alpha shell game nothing enemies kill hits progression dont buy compared original alpha massive bugs anything thats windows feels slow dipped molasses npe speak quests direction interaction world anything plus really nice power trippy moderators bad time youve spent three years working game got regression im sorry wolfy unbidden thoughts matter complete disappointment everything loved alpha bought gone replaced broken progression system somehow worse world generation design baffles six years development game got worse complete utter boring piece game alpha greater thing see wollay goes hiding grows pair actually speak completely different game compared alpha huge disappointment year development timecontent gameplay teasers seen old system leveling replaced rng items region locking thinga baffling release par fallout mans sky core gameplay loop longer fun sense actual progression boring countless scrapped features regular bugs often drop game sub fpsevery region content different aesthetics beat one region youve experienced game credit devs working game whole time mentioned actual game hand great work ethic devs first look game great game breaking bugsexcept region block gameplay nice could repetetive game flaws like drop rate items looting sure shared almost hours lack actual progression facking region block items hello im willing look away rest flaws game fuck decided region block items game grind already stuff like boat glider even disappear region block ruined game skill tree region block fixed love game big nope ps fack region block cube world good minecraft bad cube world potential sadly final product unbalanced grindy mess punishes attempts progression cube world lot issues repetitive gameplay loop feeling basically completed game clearing first region since exploration heavily discouraged lose forms travel except hawks towns cost gold many people means grinding lot gold quick travel location location pointless crafting system generally downgraded townsthere pros game good combat system allows players experience fast paced combat ummmbut classes objectively better others take example mages player instance playing warrior absolutely bad time trying fight high level mages found dungeons bosses since mages high dps burst players long distances regardless armor level addition player gets knocked fire tornado theyre basically dead since cant heal knocked tornado likely stop channeling theyre dead mean time player watch spam hopefully dodge next attack get uprangers also good example good class possessing much burst damage mages rangers allowed get consecutive hits theyre enemy crazy amount damage plus bows boomerangs hit opponents multiple times means knock enemys relatively easyleveling also pointless since player get minor buffs movement speed glider speed boat speed increased amount light generated lanternall wouldnt recommend game fair share fun playing cube world around hours issues glaring overlook point im sick getting oneshot time mages cube world released worse progression system alpha state beta content downgrade alpha creator terrible communication problems havent sought community feedback year hiatus probably led sorry state releaseafter official release creator gone dark social media platforms againdo buy cube world game lot controversies ill disregard review ill look perspective new gamecube world exporation game rpg elements opinion people go wrong judge game say rpg game forget main genre exploration game game start bad starter equipment world enemy around corner defeat enemies gain better equipment get stronger lore game anything significant also lot things need improvement one level system gain exp killing enemies way level finding artifacts right artifacts help gain bit faster sailing hang gliding climbing etc speed many think inssufficient agree since equipment becomes almost useless entering new zoneregion start getting equipment system improved bit since right bit lacking defeat dungeons thing carries next region artifacts item symbol namebesides truly enjoy playing game even though flaws cannot expect flawless game right beta developer never done would highly recommend game easy way play friends since using friendlist steam need portforward use applications hamachi cube world game open world open world game suffers lack direction map progression desired rpg power curve map sprawling humongous procedurally generated like minecraft sheer size map daunting especially considering lack content pois points interestthe game suffers many problems ill try detail experienced almost hours game time playing cube map ugly useless towns arent easily identifiable neither shrines respawn points quest locations pois visibility map unnoticeable string colored text blends right colored map legibility main reason youd add map first place indecipherable useless begs question even added first loot gear tied zones sections map player kill mobs quests explore cave systems huge mistake imo isnt point open world enable players explore punish exploration tying loot zone developer must know players opt exploring means keeping hard earned upgrades right exploration progression working odds painfully bad design choice far im leftovers actually unidentified gear items didnt know already sold shop make room items small irk game piles onto rest problems make game unintelligible understand new levels removed favor gear progressing character power isnt big issue consider ever want explore outside starting zone essentially reverted new player wont carry anything like character level onto next zone theres much walking movement speed enhancing abilities little actually explore interact set monsters always seem drop coins matter star rating combat strength could kill star pig get coins kill star bone bull get coins wealth doesnt scale actually doesnt even matter towns useless money isnt actually thing games approach zones like new player spawns placed level zone must farm monsters quests area advance higher level zone lets say level sake argument youve progressed level zone encounter tougher enemies standard tried trusted rpg story progression cube world doesnt work like cube world start zone monsters every level moving another zone doesnt make easier harder arbitrary pointless unless simply want change scenery ambient music starting zone come across star pig handle easily come across like star alpha dog get destroyed illusion way outplay monster current item level confusing mess doesnt adhere fundamental standards rpg progression clearly suffers supposedly styled taking inspiration zelda havent seen hints puzzle aspect even considered game could maybe something climbing havent seen attempt incorporating puzzle forgotten cube world failed developer didnt like criticism likely going happen fool buying game suppose unsuspecting buyers warned game likely cash grab spend money wisely unlike cube world game expected explore massive world hang glide sail climb anywhere wantthe goodfast travel without mount exploration cube world takes considerable amount time new system allows fast travelling activated

seconds ago exercise masochismlistthe game associated design philosophy sold alpha backers years ago seen despite lot progress demonstrated along lines early years game released steam different fact feel like created completely different personif developer stuck plan finished started review would likely different basis solid notthis bad game buy wasting money cube world voxelbased rpg thats currently second release public goal game create character choosing different classes explore different regions world get stronger region travel opportunities fight monsters complete dungeons craft new equipment explore variety regions game provides enjoyable played alpha release six years late comes disappointment considering direction game went little improvement addedgearbased progression region lockall games progression relies collecting gear region collect stronger weapons armor travel gear like boats hang gliders puzzlequest gear consisting different instruments miscellaneous things pets crafting books materials main goal region artifact artifacts ive seen cases first failure new system artifacts dont feel useful thing slightly buff things swimming sailing gliding speed something like strong lantern artifacts arent great item gives character massive buff overhaul second issue region lock system going new region causes weapons armor become worthless unless name even items work regions lose gear including hang glider boat etc didnt find terrible thought would region lock system wholly unsatisfying makes weaker instead ramping challenges rewards reasons go different regions exploration isnt fun due long takes travel without travel gear artifacts described earlier underwhelming would much better regions got harder rewards got better headed region lock gearunsatisfying combat character progressionits disappointing unnecessary combat considering smooth enemies fight exact ways exact drops every enemy excluding bosses drop coins random material pet food equipment etc reason fight enemy boring farming quests even worse theres longer xp system understandable gear progression systems would lot better gear provides main stats travel equipment xp would get skill points new improved abilities minor benefits like better speed travel reduction shop prices lack contentthe beta feels slightly less barebones alpha amount content considering cut alpha plans sixyear development period whats cut exactly spirit cubes alpha let buff weapons unique passives massive cities procedurallygenerated dungeons new abilities development period new classes races regions quests house building massive multiplayer servers pvp new types gear cut games original planbecause cut content lack backandforth communication community got twitter email response planned content current communication fine game came early access theres complete lack trust developers people fearing devs ghost accusing scamming people money ive seen lot negative thoughts im hopeful game keep getting developed improved considering plans change region lock system even add mod support dont think ill stay around developmenti received game bought alpha though means review doesnt count overall score game nevertheless whether buy cube world could know risk latter thing alpha look happened would recommend game current state due dull repetitive unsatisfying gameplay loop shame much wanted say great game think youre ok regionlock system means get maybe game isnt cube world exploration discovering artifacts dungeons upgrading gear killing mobs bosses thrilling experience youve understood mechanics

little uses used really need know youre looking forafter years shouldnt really surprise game changed release wouldve ended happening even game slowly updated game complicated go back alpha jumping bandwagon people saying games bad go toxic somewhere else thats say disclosure buy game alpha live years ago week learn beta game went public cube world something waiting since beginning years finally announced excited see far come instead however weve given unfair game stupidly slow progression game expects explore better sitting town talking every single npc trying head dungeon low level getting wiped way randomly spawning enemies harder prepare cube world best example player feedback important early access games managed upset huge majority players addition exclusion rather controversial features addition planned features completely absent final product game manages jump pedestal drop dead ground leveling xp alpha days would get xp killing monsters leveling meant new skill points spend however like making skill stronger acquiring whole new one skill tree didnt many options advanced one plans never arrivedmeanwhile release cube world way get xp level finding regions artifact youll get slight bonus around random noncombat stat sailing speed gliding speed lantern strength etc also means skills unlocked beginning strength comes wear ill iterate bad decision later topic regionlocked items previously mentioned characters strength comes items wear interesting choice first glimpse youll soon wish wasnt case find equipment restricted land found exceptions addition regions size drastically reduced youll small playground use new hardearned yellow items enemies tiers zones size reduced b b supposed played separately enemies tiers white green blue purple yellow order means enemies crammed together might fighting whites yellows side combined fact youll also run wandering yellow enemies oneshot really shows bad decision progression get discuss games progression really takes said beforethere real progression earn completing zone meaningless bonus random stat youll access finding finding special item tied stat lack levels item regionlocking makes going new zone different creating whole new character conclusion bad decisions made hidden playerbase yearlong development period argue thats wollays vision game respect game promises sold us alpha players back additionally nothing really added aside procedural quest system new biomes advanced skill trees new classes building etcthe game huge potential making changes solely ideas consulting actual customers imply might get bad reviews game cube world never becoming strongest destroying everything path journey adventure exploring finding neat things people lost track vision alpha test never seen light day people pressured existencei like game give cube world item based progression xp difficult encounters cant fight higher levels win barely fight levels exploration based gear loss entering new level item based progression xp difficult encounters fight higher levels win skill based exploration based gear loss cube scam alpha brb guise thx monies huehuehuecube heist beta greatest year scamjebait shame jebait twice pound anoos put steam cube world alpha good game fun felt like accomplishing things every often cube world feels overly tedious accomplish anything kill thirty mobs get gold gear find npcs kill anything better gear score upgrade gear travelling slow boring much cause go attack wrong mob youre instantly dead walk distance unless lucky found one respawn shrines theyve honestly ruined good game changes cube world odd development history sure game came hiding confirmed final release date pleasantly surprised excitement slowly grew greater anticipated beta release date approachedwhen release came heard rumblings friends bewildering changes ultimately made game profoundly unpleasant reserved judgement could good long formulate opinions drastic turn design philosophy game took felt lot changes interesting wholly bad concept often compared game something akin zelda randomized run every given region new random run key items scattered strange far places ensuring ones progression given region wouldnt predictable pattern ultimately think concept could work well done way leaves players feeling punished daring truly explore game world could try speculate tweaks could change system better id rather focus experience ended deriving game endjumping idea progressing anew new region items collected first thing youre likely want find new gear strengthen character leads next probably important point gear meaningful time meaningless strength character largely determines level enemies successfully take wilderness gear ranked based rarity subsequent rarity different color whitegreenbluepurpleyellow overall gear score largely determines strength compared random enemies whose names correspond color system indicate strength possible take enemy higher level tier current character unlikely could take one two depending circumstances rhyme reason might encounter enemies simply strong fight means early spend time gingerly exploring hopes accidentally pulling enemy utterly destroy also means meaningful vertical progression game enemy yellow colored name comparable strength powerful end game bosses game throw youve killed enemy yellow health youve essentially conquered worst thing game throw making subsequent encounters enemies feel meaningless since youve already done hardest hard content topic meaninglessness enemies progress ranks power dont ever really differ characteristics abilities fight yellow named enemy largely identical fight white named enemy numbers simply higher nothing encourage adapt play style early game end game essentially identical different color slapped textaside gear progression main reason explore find bits ancient lore describing powerful ancient kingdom inhabited region world youve discovered pieces lore given kingdom location artifact item revealed aside however lore essentially meaningless lore largely consists vapid fragments factoids kingdom way determine relate anything might find observe around kingdom challenges might face endeavor acquire artifact possible encounter strong boss enemy name corresponding name discovered lore however uncertain based lore simply coincidence number preset names list random name generators smalloverall game entertaining hours however afterward may start dawn utterly meaningless unfulfilling game cube world really simple game run around talking people unlocking new areas killing everything areas claiming land cube world interesting game say least love fact region blocked gear however dont agree every region need gather special item example hand gliderboat get annoying third run artifact mechanic lot potential however useless since gives movement speed gives hp damage buff totally worth farming dont see point playing game except gonna explore different biomes taming pets gameit fun first regions gets somewhat pain worth playing first hours ill say time kill bad idea pick game cube world bad game sadly instead improvement got worse since alpha game calls actionrpg rpg progressions got removed replaced roguelike one time progress based solely gear valid region sort kingdom found inas soon cross border begining zerounlike games like dark souls skill matters however must farm gear every single region otherwise simple mobs kill quickly effectively punishing explorationwhile game states description combat skill based active dodge combo hits increasing damage truth paper reality stat realying heavy combat without gear impossible fight tougher foes gear needed gear lost upon entering new regioni sadly cannot recommend buying developer makes mind make game playable enjoyable way instead tedious obnoxious grindfest reason cube world game watched long time bought old alpha back still could waited wollay come

exploration reason go constantly die region locked lootskills gonecharacter progression gonesense pride accomplishment na despite hate gets removing traditional leveling region locking everything game still fun problem purpose fun getting gear completing challenges region fun reward artifact gives basically useless buff problem complete region basically beaten gamethe ways think make game closer game loved years ago back skill tree sort constant progression work towards artifacts give skill point skill tree alongside combat stat buffor add combat stat buffing skills tree upgraded multiple times make exploration stats artifacts used give instead gotten recollecting corresponding exploration toolwhich would ideally go away regions new regionswith things something work towards long term skill trees completing regions actually gives notable difference combat performance movement tools like hang glider boat restricted region actually dont mind combat gear region locked without would steamroll everything completing one region artifacts would help combat like suggested wont big deal recollect gear since combat skill getting better every region completeif wollay make changes happen

building way tiers one area need restart gear scratch transition another area exact thing six years release worse alpha stage honestly disappointing waited long time play game enjoy little bit severely lacking content regions hit miss feels insane start game annoying mind numbing process trying fight white level enemies getting nothing resorting trying drag enemies friendly npcs job incapable anything playing friends far tell far thought well seems join need game need created character means spawn different place lovely pregenerated map need find village travel friend using flight master instead know join friends region invalidates least one persons gear making beginning slog even worseafter initial start dying trying roll good rng finally ability level missions results good luck finding even talking every npc hours region friend discovered landmarks one quest location set map hoping find locations people tell able take pretty much every enemy see feels like horrible miss game different everyone playing another friend got hang decently early lucky npcs give us locations quests getting decent gear startthe rest game different kind slog mindlessly walking around killing enemies hoping good loot even bigger problem system horrible balance killing miniboss wild drop rareer gear seems horrible coop system ends getting op weapon getting one isolates player feeling like cannot anything one good gear understandably tries kill higher tier monsters loot drop would better items inability damage enemies outside level assume meant anticheese mechanic splits party one person good killing things one even worse people perhapsif play someone else prepared lot talking traversing vast empty land masses trying find stuff current level mis matched across region boring watching paint dry traveling around game way entertaining none npcs interesting talking literally youve seen inability travel regions discover different enemies try make game less mundane impossible losing boat reins entering literally region stupidest thing someone could would want ocean biome knowing get swim around hoping find boat would want enter another vast landscape knowing youll stuck one speed wandering around hoping find reins feels like glorified walking simulator half time wandering around hoping find enemies match god forbid die dungeon yet find respawn point close actual entrance requiring walk back different experiences dungeons usually around minutes party deep dungeon longer eagle flight badly want recommend game hot trash modding community hope save honestly bought game way back first released alpha played everloving shit probably putting somewhere around hours guess whole summer friends obsessed good damn game skills fun classes felt great combat blast eventually played less less stopped altogether months since game wasnt getting updated always talked great game going eventually get updated flash forward yearsand gotta say im disappointed whatever reason wollay decided take things made game fun addictive xp removed making killing mobs world pointless combat gutted skill trees gutted progression tied retarded artifacts find give random useless stat even gonna go detail region locking gear hands one worst systems ive ever seenas much hurts im gonna give one recommended maybe wollay revert changes decide update different direction case ill gladly come back flip vote honestly usually dont leave negative reviews leave reviews im probably one alpha users didnt play alpha much cannot comment one game better im going talking gamelets get negatives way idea first time opened game quit half hour killing mobs making progress directionless games fine typically games give freedom choose typically show mention options player set goal himherself killing mobs early feels unrewarding feel like selfexplanatory played game time shows iv played hours hours dont think iv gotten many memorable didnt work class confusing game design choices look map game youll see white area outlines given part game world zones understand intended story sorts given questlines said numerous questionable choices developer made gliders weapons full power essentially region locked dont get weapon havent gotten far im making guesses without looking things much weapons armor ect weakened items wear influence many things importantly imo hp loose hp quickly game even weak mobs required certain level dodging avoid big attacks dont melt love combat feel like pretty fluid think world looks pretty even though blocks think colorful world pretty energetic npc quest lines pretty funthats really right feel like could never recommend game lost even youtube videos watched said dont give wollay believe turn around take easy step step dont let negative reviews bring horrible game developer ruined game communication towards backersonce beat region seen game offer gear lost leave region horrible developer horrible game hot garbage feel

randomly generated got chance find unique skill tree even simply alpha nice alot players liked upgrades got great potential instead update exploration aspect fog see everything map since alot missing features alpha one examples weapon upgrades cubes could upgrade weapon damage stats change abit look class balance classes really easy start classes bad quests even artifacts bad stats feature nice flying points speed traveling even exploration aspect fog edventure aspect dungeons artifacts even stats bad looking think version npcs alpha bought years agoits worse bought game years agoa lot features planned showed website like housing pvp skills every class races multiplayerand useless game without feeling progression artifacts fucking useless skill treeshonnestly game scam wollay removed everything planned website really changed mind evolution cube world didnt paid game nowi passed didnt want think game bad give bought game play friends mine told lot fun started playing quickly realised game barely fun barely anything except combat combat way repeating never anything new exciting game would recommend bought game back first came unlocked steam better steam release even unfinished state developer totally abandoned game abandoned years ago put steam quick cash grab abandoned stay away bought game returned found region locking found doc keys game got freeand matter much wollay fucked player base insult disguised game still got free gets technical thumbs imagine laughing cause game joke bought game euros like years ago blast playing exploring leveling becoming stronger greati contacted creators cuzz lost files since got new pc amazing enough send steam key thank thatnow lets talk dont like gamethere goal choose class youre town collect apples mushrooms cook food kill cows running around exploring constantly killed everything ive figured colors indicate strength found items shrines idea discription open wiki play game thats poor game designwhere level system go kill weak enemies get fragments turn armor cool decent armor get instead oneshot enemies ever beat progress indicator direction apparently need find item progress next area start thats way level looking find tamed lemon beetle cant ride anymore since bought apparently need item ride short give direction tutorial ill keep getting frustrated able anything wandering goal mind bought game alpha leveling system reason explore world even didnt lot quests things fast forward years later game comes beta quests reason explore fight anything actually punishes going outside playpeni much rather would preferred alpha betas quests cube worlds release feels like less content alpha bought game first released way back alpha stage ive spent hundreds hours old version hurts say release version isnt nearly enjoyable hoped would main issue stands region locking upgrades gear special items seem unusable cross border new territory forcing restart time hurts game way much exploring new zone horrible losing special items worked towards getting found jumping cliffs expecting use hang glider fall straight group enemies leveling seems thing even though character stated level equipment menu health arbitrarily went went new zone dropped back starting levels im assuming tied equipment another reason thats infuriating remember back alpha bit progression character life cant find anymore exists seems really hiddenbuggy ive ran several annoying bugs game one making starting zone absolutely drag first thing arriving town first time losing fights enemies near go general goods vendor instead offering normal things marked enemy attacked sight knowing vendor fought back killed longer respawn lead try explore regions next starting ones new towns met issues another glitch ive experience minor deals terrain generation would put things like lore spots books shrines floating voids pretty much unreachable new enemies lacking older features remember gameplay feels solid moving fun climbing jumping paragliding combat passable works boring dealing high health enemies respawn points incredibly annoying especially factor annoying region locking spawn point right next area fighting happens another zone instead chooses respawn halfway across map one region currently lead minute travel times attempt boss might kill frustrating close game amazingit really sucks cant recommend spent much time back alpha stage hoping would continue path seemed main issue region locking removed could honestly recommend price much fun get spending time friends honestly played bought alpha god damn bad pure dogshit brought game years ago experienced alpha version lot going enjoyed lot updates came haltnow finally comes everything mostly knew game gone stripdown version beloved alpha friend went finding sorts things removed original alpha version finally killed region itemlock systemafter checking see attention would seem hasnt response developers lack communication helping

rewarded form progression game currently buff useless stat never use idea get buff diving speed considering theres reason ever dive begin dont necessarily hate idea region locked equipment starting area current state terriblealso bought game back alpha hoping get refined version product instead given completely different genre game cannot recommend game could completely different direction developer would listened feedback engaged discussion updated regularly instead users given silent treatment result worst game years ago changed review negative purely devs cash grab ethics support seems dropped game moment released could write fairly detailed review pros cons linear progression vs horizontal progression everyone already covered feel say youre considering buying keep mind dev kept contact community years releasing paid alpha made meaningful changes game years biggest insult feel impression early access release surprised find dev honestly considers completed game rough beta remarkable step back content compared alpha offeredi feel bad dev levels seems generally anxious worked job developing game dream project excuse asking money ghosting people half decade even randos

captive inside last six years always optimistic rushed game forever bad somehow though game feels like less content alpha hate say happens cut community feedback create large game one ensure quality game still potential reputation damaged game incredible world generation lore fundamental design flaws core gameplay loop issues get addressed game get boring completing single region hyped game playing since im waiting makes upset confused pissedhere thoughts also tldr bottom also played way hours ton account bought brother beaten regions far characters legendries one regionwolly wants game exploration game core isnt finding gear kill things stronger get gear end finding artifact problem exp legendary purple gear reason kill lower ranking enemies get nothing rewarding besides like food ingredients think removing exp system made want kill lower enemies biome feels lame explore im wandering around region see openness nothing else since enemies higher rarity run away barely kill game becomes one huge fetch n quest spamming alt think wolly make want explore cool structures massive dungeons better towns better environment basically make map look interesting biome also sort unique environment player could interact deal like raining mana tree something desert storm feel like biomes life barren everything looks enemies also appear often imo already said removing xp system also removing skill tree feels weird horrible design choice miss able lvl also shaping character way want via skill trees think could solve adding skill master town biome learn new techniques character choose layout damn skill tree region lock one bafflingworst ideas ever want explore explore im told already beat regions rewarding slightest get beating region getting stupid artifact increases lamp radious regions damn small fact gear becomes trash next region terrible weapon scaling game imo horrible got really lucky good weapon weapon made destroy everything around making challenge less rewarding reason like lvl scale enemies lvl still make game hard game rgn luckbased loot system know loot tracker sometimes doesnt even work get gear classes think wollay add gearbased regions like desert get cool desert looking armor gives player unique passive region way gear bound armor fun way think also think would cool player collected couple certain artifacts around regions made ascend spirit relm whole new biome difficult doesnt make current gear awful traverse place fight final boss incredibly hard boss get amazing gear passives skills also needs add classes stuff atm farm arena lot wrong game especially removing much alpha use way back machine picroma website see much slap face really much taken added tldr game feels slow lack progression without exp skill trees make want explore via cool looking land locations make biomes interactive type region lock imo bad let keep gear fix stupid weapon scaling add interesting gear related biome passives new area get via special artifacts add classes stuff planned originally waiting quite get hold game friends recommended every damn time played refuse accept idea isnt worth short time less hour fantastic hard start dont dislike games matter case point difficult start difficult let greatest teacher waiting game since wasnt expecting much wanted game little bit fun little bit grind didnt want game spawn world get one

progression game makes problem worse able level grind would add extra dimension game least instead restart region aside rare gear also transportation items stripped change regions makes artifacts feel completely useless nearly finish region even though multiple biomes game dont feel different enough dungeons essentially causing feel like palette change rather actually different biome though add dark forest biome bit interesting restthe combat excellent simple fun simplicity leveling leveled gear different levels itin conclusion game could turned horrendous development cycle helped strip parts game many early adopters game loved played game much back alpha birthday days ago say hell birthday present wolfram crazy son bitch actually thank muchcomparing game minecraft feels like null point like bringing terraria even surface level game open world rpg god great actually forgot much missed absolutely brilliant perspective someone played absolute hell pre alpha game fundamentally

people upset region based progression dont understand new progression system intended thought would hate really everything changed doesnt matterdont let region locking scare bad people make seem honestly lets experience whole new area whole new set tasks without way overpowered despite people say gear take next region even turns grey still better gear makes starting easierits worth played hours straight cant get enough dont even feel like ive scratched surface tried buying game steam mobile road trip phone stopped working got highway tried giving shot scaling enemies way certain mobs destroy chance try several different tactics dying takes long get back basically game becomes boring quickly dont want another region start scratch even mods feel like nothing left game tried absolute hardest like game honestly cannot recommend current state gameplay relies idea fun play entire area get relic barely fucking anything continue next region stripped hardearned gear available within previous region idea wollay view great idea fact far fucking worst thing come incredible alpha much potential thrown goddamn trash horrible ideas lack community communication honestly saddens much game loved many excellent start fall fucking face finally launched tried best play level head quite frankly theres many frustrating aspects game quite frankly make boring less content alpha even less game beforeif enjoy exploring boring landscapes unrewarding content poor guides game spent minutes walking get starting much funits real shame game ignored feedback produced terrible content years effort nothing worth buying serious update released tried really tried liking nothis game ideas thats clearly based exploration tries botw kinda thing power isnt based level equipment except good well done cube world already empty enough world make literally everything pointless dungeonssome classes straight unplayable solo multiplayer isnt actually playable problem alpha partgetting rid exp terrible mistake used defend change saying could upsides game lost value things gone mare scaling leveling gear lost upon switching region gutsy move useless one game didnt need way shape formthe game progression unlock new abilities anything get stat increases way remotely enjoy game fan roguelikes game things actually get lose change region minor stats increasealso game still optimized like crap itll run computers dont expect cpu stay cool game like long wait statedo buy dont typed whole thing steam crashed pretty much reiterating points everyone else makinganyways heres problem game hard like really hard beginning start star character really get anything fight star enemies really hard find go star enemies thinking arent gonna hard think exponentially stronger walk speed kill super easily go back star use special ability chug health potions make sure dont die literal sheep even drop coins another problem everything far away majority time spent playing game literally walking making sure didnt die star swarm enemies get something game highly unbalanced buy game wollay makes actually playable rarely write reviews games however feel warn perspective buyers thisi spent many happy hours playing alpha many many moons ago abandoned word whatsoever developer heard released played game chose support years ago levelling system region locked loot pretty much ruins aspect exploration combat pointless irate sheep kill hits manage find loot barest stat increases soon leave region found youre back square one im hugely disappointed since first request refund several years ago went unanswered dont expect get one would recommend game anyone likes levelling character progression exploration combat mind numbing loot grinder majority loot becomes worthlessnon existant cross imaginary border game amazing potential ruined ill keep checking time time see gets fixed moment avoid like plague waited six years game loved alpha version cant give version good review took exp leveling game hard enough beginning low level enemies fight level one alpha still low level enemies cant even grind exp enemies lower level instead everything beats plenty enemies one shot also theres combat healing besides potions making food wasnt much problem pick heart plants plentiful make like hundred pots time feels like incredibly scarce mention cant explore ten feet without running monster one shot mentioned didnt even play much game reviews ive read claim gear even resets region hard enough try grind grind gear exp gain fucking every time travel far two fun aspects game used exploring biomes fighting cool looking random enemies bosses theres reason either things new version game encourages avoiding every fight thats quest dungeon boss dont get game alpha version available back felt like complete game many people never know cant buy version anymore waited six years items region locked lose exp system many concerns people saidplease read cube world reddit explain problems waited six years play game disappointed many unnecessary annoying systems weak multiplayer servers reset items changing biomu skill tree searching strength biomes one region every npc give location new classes races water wizard oneman army cant kill heals attacks time asterisk system could old leveling system saw making progress hidden artifacts game system artifacts unlock example going boxsuch artifacts could hidden cool harp used open dungeons bit overkill currently stars attack defense probably outbound entire region times find artifact terribly annoying mechanic stops fun new monsters new artifacts flute unlocking spawnpoints etcin opinion game worth price pln someone really wants play cube world let find game years ago much better waited release post review introduction bought alpha years ago fun itive played around hours betathe first hours terrible everythings kill game doesnt tell anything need relay external sources time im wrinting review scarce progression changed level progression item based progression bad progression well made instead skill level unlock everything start gear divided rarity normal legendary mobs youll encounter killing mobs certain rarity drop items rarity level bosses quests give items rarity level aboveother normal gear find special items artifactsspecial items glider reins boat allow faster way travelling spirit bell divine harp sky flute allow access secret areas either one item goldartifacts honestly disappointing thing game bonus give virtually nonexistent combat related certanly worth grind locked behind region locking artifacts everything find region locked youll lose changing region meaning basically starting scratch every time cross border losing gear special items kinda understand gear reset special items carry since couple regions starts getting chore getting backthere special gears end name carry adjacent regions pretty rare finding rare item pretty difficult combat ill start saying game internal documentation classes skills meaning discorver workthere classes specializzations ive played warrior mage speak combat style pretty shallow either face tank lifesteal enemy deal warrior run around attack enemy knocked mage enemies lot model differs youll start noticing different kind combat theyll use mimicking classes meaning youll quickly learn deal combat become either mindless mash buttons good gear certain death dont personal skill wont make difference exploration world gen lore region locking basically gut exploration procedural world gen pretty good get boring pretty quickly given gamelay loop really rewarding ive seen different biomes far clearly different point interest youll find pretty much sameas lore nonexistant read tablets give random info guys kingdoms dont really care given zero context reasons care times tell location npcs quests jorney youll find plenty bands npc adventurers talk might give quests quests mean save trader gnome x monsters get crafting book x monsters kill boss monster thing annoying lack variety time comment appearance like hand glidenpcs might also give locations special items pretty usefull since said time give random comment also reliable method finding items conclusion cubeworld promising game years developing worst state alpha im saddened alpha great starting point needed content wollay even showed twitter reason chose discard left full release im hoping updates make modify review want game good really dobut six years silent development coming back state im holding hopelevelling removed skills removed game actively punishes exploring locking gear youve earned theres little effort put sort combat balancing world isnt even randomly generated anymore seed fixed youre dumped random spoti cant even see anything would taken six years add game largely anything entertaining removed actual exploration replaced one tediously dull gameplay loops ever devisedmaybe one day wollay come back full release actually took player feedback board seriously doubt though want like game really held special place childhood excitement immeasurable saw announcement hell even upgraded computer windows play friends im sad say let bad game whats whats removing exp skill tree gargantuan mistake made grind worth finally level get new powerful skill even point killing anything quest monsters dungeon monsters everything else waste time health region locking cant even begin describe awful hard work grinding gone know stepped invisible line grind even harder get items guess work region neighbouring regions thats nothing permanent except pets lose ability ride step invisible line point anything nothing matters temporary hard work rewarded saddening wake reality game crashing burning simply cant pretend okay special really rubbed salt wound ever since massive storm hatred hit game main developer gone away could understand first time sure okay anymore absolutely coming cash grab scam rate get one likes sent constant hate mail always going people like others politely possible tried explain game gone wrong really soooooo unbelievably sensitive vulnerable hate maybe make effort solve problems wont receive reality dev

missed opportunity buy multiplayer class based rpg unique style incredibly exciting methe announcement release counting days could finally play early beta reviews started come concerned hear rpg levelling aspects taken backseat make way repetitive system resets progression areaafter dropping game made character began try joining friends impressively confusing system join friend seemingly nothing happens eventually realised world thousands kilometers away also eventually also realised use eagle get mean menus gameplay unintuitive confusingat point lost one friend couldnt deal intense lag felt towns took long time figure trying duel wield sword shield worked restarted ok theres bugs performance issues tooso together last set quests first things could basic fetch quests required us trying get away level squirrels long enough pick glider things could kill along way didnt seem drop anything interesting apart bow weapon none use could use thing go get harp promptly killed random high level enemies near harp location figured something going repeat next area werent going enjoy progression system added game could still claim refund bailedi didnt go game hoping give negative review game ive wanted since childhood sceptical given games previous years history lack thereof ultimately feel game one recommend one ive felt needed refundedits impossible know whether game updated future becomes polished fun product im willing give second chance future given waited years got entirely different game hardly features teased developer little communication community dont much hopeits shame game turned way cant surprised game changed entirely isolation without chance feedback ive following cube world years game introduced love voxel gamesi bought twice game alpha also played heck itthat said wollay finallyafter disappearing years without keeping promise update game announced release steam quite excited even though ive lost hope point joined beta honest extremly disappointed took everything exciting picroma website roadmap still said would additions skill system gone replaced region lock including much needed glider boat ruined could live recommend could would refund money spent bf alas years latenote wollayhalloich finde es erschreckend das du die ddos attacke als ausrede benutzt ich selber leide borderlinedepression und einer sozialen phobie dennoch ich es mich im internet zurecht zufinden es gibt immer trolls die dir den tod den hals ddos attacken sind nichts neues konzerne wie nexon ea etcdas gibt dir keinen grund dir das geld einzusacken und dann jahre zu verschwinden und ohne feedback von den leuten die dein produkt gekauft haben weiter zu machen viele sind dran das es dein projekt istdas mag ja sein dennoch sobald du dein projekt geld verdienst ist es nichtmehr nur deinswir haben das alpha projekt gekauft und wollten dich und du machst alles kaputt wenn du dein geliebtes projekt noch retten willst solltest du auf uns und dich erwachsen benehmen und dich nicht unter nem stein verkriechentldr game deservers hate getting since devoloper lives bubble ive looking forward game coming since seeing gameplay footage alpha completely different game irritating loose items every time switch biomes making biomes unplayable game huge letdown dont get game unless developer rolls back alpha ive game since beginning past years wild ride cube world finally herefor expecting improved version old alpha stop cube world longer game treat game something newyou die lot game punishes hard playing carefully using skill early game region slow involve lot running around able kill weak creatures might lose hopedont stop playingseriously keep playing explore region find ruins artifacts lore items unlock spawn points moving long distances become easy due teleporting find quest boss dungeon spawn point near keep going picking mobs one one youll die lot quickly run back spawn point nearbyas soon get first pieces gear even seem crappy first game becomes easier thats starts get really funcube world game doesnt hold hand punishes hard overcome challenge rewards satisfying worth hour grinding dungeon ive gotta say im disappointed ive looking forward playing game long time alpha still better longer skill tree level system isnt based exp makes feel kind pointless play game isnt feeling progressionwhy mobs hitpoints spawning right next starting area actually impossible kill even baiting enemy town sacrificing npcs wasting minutes trying kite rewards killing said enemy non existant gold killing skull bull basic geara costs get shitty boomerang damage doesnt really make sensethe menus also really glitchy lot times item descriptions go offscreen possible read crafting requirements another problem remapping controls possible accidently use potion shouldnt able use abilities quick items menuthe game much optomized alphaq requires freakin super computer render feels like step backwards biggest gripe wide variety skillslooking foward future progress game cannot enjoy playing ive missed ive never played alpha barely knew anything nevertheless got caught hype finally got hands game felt empty classes horribly unbalanced abilities either nonfunctional boring rogue archer stealth ability rogue stealth abilities really nothing doi ended refunding strongly suggest skipping cube world devs fix even lack progression people complaining game doesnt work ive never refunded game fast remembered game beautiful progression best thing game doesnt new game isnt progression waste time please release alpha version steam buy cant remember old account old version way im gonna get play illegal download ive owned cube world since alpha release six years ago mostly impressive many backward steps could taken development end disappointment game timetheres contenttheres meaningful progressiontheres class depththeres permanent equipmentand theres way spend sales tax game ive played beta bit say ok game promised lot content given barely anything biggest complaint isnt gear system artifacts lack endgame content artifacts boring weak incentivize players hunt also endgame content pretty much expected game loreit much potential become something great got current price id recommend years waited absolutely ive played game since alpha got lot enjoyment steaming pile mess supposed im entirely sure alpha release steam something went terribly wrong experience based leveling system gone looks like replaced sad gear score system get better gear farming materials farming materials running away everything moves unless run faster stay alive farm materials go first sword lets go kill cute little beetle pops like blood balloon garbage run away save money ive put little time game far im impressed really really dislike high level enemies near starting point theres nothing wanting come back ive sunk countless hours alpha beta release different promised worse execution tries honestly skip come back updates first hour two miserable gaming experience reason knew reddit previous experience playing alpha tips explanations anything even skills nothing suggest youre even supposed every creature punishingly hard even white trash mobs like chickens kill hits manage overcome slump finally grab gear anywhere min hours mostly random find itll appropriate gear class people get lucky find gear sitting log others farm hours nothing slowly kill enemies would experience rewards quests get items help explore climbing gearboathang glideretc neat since major point game explore worldnow things fall apart point game explore yet game actively punishes attempt cripplingly hard monsters everywhere slow movement speedno toggle auto running vast open empty lands largest complaint cross border another region lose exploration items collected gear nerfed point uselessness essentially start beginning every time cross new region gear based progression done right actually fun far done well see artifacts collect region carry new regions sound cool right except artifacts give useless buffs hardly noticeable far affect exploration things glad spent hours raise swimming speed slight percentage game much potential artifacts actually made relevant overarching storybossgoaletc literally point leaving first region unless want see new color tilesets end quests collect gear kill things every region measly upgrades make radius lamp like pixels larger genuinely applaud people ive read stopped playing four regions cant even make past two regions meaningless infinite loop progression fact tweets developer years recently month ago showing cool features none things game though one really stings alpha playersthose followed past years development shame since tons fun first region dawned shallow loop game offer hope changes made eventually waited years lets say wasnt worth wait im patient anymore doesnt help devs terrible communication deleting social medias profiles unless wollaypixxie actually say something soon safe assume game abandoned asked years ago get cube world id say yeah fun hard something could endlessly explore grind fun rewarded exploring slap face soon cross different border gear items pets worthless garbage youre forced start zero hard enough shot nearly shot gatei saw added lore game get sentences interact lore piece uninteresting unhelpfuli say im severely underwhelmed couldve kept alpha new mobs improved multiplayer wouldve happy straight cheeks sucks even worse developers decide work well see another update maybe years minimum wont return game know iti nothing constructive say skills required design games however tell certain bad game buy important edit devs already going stealth mode deleting blogs radio silence likely abandon game mess never get fixedwhats point exploration focused rpg gear items region locked meaning go another area gear scales drastically items like hang glider useable new area guy fucking years make something wollay decided make even worseyou know enter new area game uninstall itselffuck sheit fine renders like shit dont make progress go next area items became wayless good special items reset leave area find also game never ever gonna updated idk happened game used fun beta fight boss first quest cant even fight unless hes quicksand trap else get destroyed range damage expected progress barely fight level enemies class wizard would replace gear system old good exp system would good game right fuck first hour without getting killed crow tried kill bought game official release im terribly sorryif bought game however urge try find copy alpha version get hands play instead enjoyed alpha youre gonna bad time thing similar version alpha art style get region lock disabling mod like

system made combat fun combat worse elder scrolls somehow game got worse years development thankfully didnt buy improved artifacts balance regionlocked gearfex one combat one mobility statother game actually really wellmade world genshin impact exists cannot comprehend playing genshin impact free cube world much much betterbut sure genshin impact read reviews cube world game bad use review find play instead worse state game years ago completely abandoned developer every new region grind everything scatch real progression artifacts work everywhere help possible way except faster region grind thats litterally difference alpha full versionthe developers needed years make game worse current state enjoy game excited see things show trailers thoroughly disappointed found none basically wasted could gone towards supporting something much better sadly dont think ill able get refund ive wasted much time already im upset disappointed feel lied stolen current form game even close promised wait see dev makes regular updatesupdate still updates frankly looks like developer ran away fuck dumpsterfire current state alpha version much better full release removed skill trees locked progression region making gear collected said region pointless also difficult mobs requiring tedious amount time kill even party stick alpha verison hopefully improved opinion game fun flaws fixed might wondering gave negative review well lets say developer disappeared want listen community might wait another six years another update see memes get worse time goes opinion cubeworld good video game although heard leveling system also worked killing monsters seems llogical considdering kill mobs time played friend couple hours even strong equipment still struggled strong mobs didnt level hours playing note went completely blind idea artifacts increased levels ive talked wanna point cant launch anymore crashes going fullscreen still crashes even changing fullscreen fullscreen thats assumption cpu goes full capacity reason crashes game soon done loading dont understand could start first place oh well cant launch anymore guess thats thati also read minimal system requirements ive tried fixing realised cpu shouldnt power run would reason able launch played first four hoursits pity really enjoyed playing anyone tipps information please message c six years core loop made worse instead better nonsensical balance issues remain incredible gameplay exactly expecting epic game butfix god damn multiplayer sucks cant say would recommend game incredible potential introduction whatsoever questionable game balance get easily bored walking around aimlesslylooking forward future changes though incredibly boring gear regionlocked means lose hard earned recipes gear upon entering new area dont know wolly dev thought good idea god damn one hell shitshow worlds empty every enemy much stronger real way farm resources craft better gear game disappointment like buy game potential extremely poorly executed incredibly disappointing hype adding single good feature since alpha really tried like plain simply god awful pure rng progression awful formula nearly every enemy god comparison fun balanced slightest fact get legitimately barred progress bad rng ruins redeeming factor new system could highly recommend staying away dumpster fire instantly abandoned release interesting exploration sense wonder ruined bland combat absolutely baffling design decisions region lock removal exp skill trees complete lack progression creates game doesnt really know wants rpg kinda roguelike really adventure game nowait sale play friends though multiplayer laggy think thoughts brief history cube interesting idea progression line works sadly needs bit thinking thru interesting rogue like hard enemies avoided lower levels game good yes actually appears crash even starts great bothers say fails live game hoping released many years simply doesnt exist anymoresince ive received game picroma store bought alpha review wont counted overall rating trust dont play game cube world absolutely insulting alpha also fails live ownnow wollay developer gone people claim ran away money others say got alienated community either way silent brings back memories alpha best mods region lock bad monsters badly balanced im nostalgia could decent mod modswhich found subreddit overall lacking substance promised worse original alpha build couldve masterpiece im still giving positive review game kept entertained hundreds hours perhaps mods add lot changes thatd nice unlikely get update someday get back former glory bad practically progress really hurts game deeply saddens state game disappointment address differences two versions game since people probably havent played previous version however address issues game experience youll receive game start near village knowledge youll run around spam npcs give quests spend time running away enemies get said quest get quest youll likely find gimmic cheese enemies progression feels unnatural essence youll go able fight anything able fight everything ease youre done area youll move onto another area gear useless since region bound legendaries white new region gear like hang glider boat also region bound cross border progression gone form progression dungeons recollect necessary gear enter dungeon complete get items arent bound region theyre flawed base give slight improvements make progression reset less grueling roughly less percent items increase lantern range climb speed comes class class progression none whatsoever skill tree abilities change except two things modify someone change spec example mage choose fire water thing modify abilities weapon using modifies left right mouse little variety specs well mostly reskinned would highly recommend purchasing game changes made progression system character complexity differed original vision got better areas went different path othersthere mod eliminate zone locked gear issues people fun coop edit playing little bit getting first artifact main zone goal say exploration game punishes exploringafter hours thing able take one zone next clime speed boost mention infinite generated world see reason leave starting zone explore anything going removed soon leave area edit apparently artifacts broken dont actually add anything visually technically meaning even getting pointlessnot theres word devs since hit steam feels awful recommending game years waiting play game first time playing feltemptylike theres something missing reading reviews features alpha version missing made feel like left amazing experience unfortunetly played hours cant refund try ill probably play see opinions still stands gameplay felt also difficult confusing enemies could roll smoke

treasure full blue already yellow bummer game resulted six years waiting damn disappointment honestly worse previous build decent long game youve never played beforeits disaster youve playing original version beforeid rather create new character different class go next zone slight increase boat speed never use anyway game much potential yet executed badlythe developers scrapped entire roadmap alpha call reboot ground changing game plays dramaticallythey created expectations using roadmap yet incapable executing let falling short hence criticismsdont buy game think get better updates took years get released yet barely get anything worthwhile let alone complete gameafter years development game surely deserve release version sad fact alpha years ago complete state current version skill trees gone levels gone combat iswell good fact gear stops working cross new zone baffling stops working mean weapons armour back cant use special items last zone hang glider boat seems hes spent long working alone really needed feedback seems lot hype merely coming long time result lot reviews dont actually seem anything useful game needs work enjoy yes dont mind lack tutorial lack levels skills fact gear reset cross line one zone another shame really really exited see six years waiting would bring game dev announced cube world would coming steam ready found removed almost everything made game good reason explore gone see exp would want kill mobs talent tree gear locked zone got gear even glider boat region locked thats insanityi mean order check wasnt going crazy game boring went played alpha version still great really dont understand dev would strip things game instead adding new artifacts quests would remove experience order keep sense growth pure madnesssadly inferior

farm money items get legendary items lack meaningful progression killed game rpg without progression awful idea lacks content better alpha devs get shit together large parts game feel worse alpha years ago dont count dev fix change anything major theres reason think hes listening even thinks anything changed game fun first hours doesnt take long see extremely shallow enemy types mindless ranged guys mindless melee guys behave exactly except special attacks use theres skill tree real customisation aside choosing class unique skills weapon type used class virtually nothing substance improved years might mean anything never played alpha make pause youre expecting continued support new features release largely empty elementary combat limited ability explore freely alpha supposed years cities houses much cut communication dev team days starting releasewhat shame last update message back september back another quiet hiatus meantime theres work done theres pressure community disappear lock away social media pressure cooker finally finished let preface saying regret money spent game years ago unfortunately however gamethere logical reason spend current state would feel bad try justify new individuals based experience years ago simply good game anymore given track record developer little reason expect changefor people havent play simply move try something else played alpha already key give hours deserves make opinion lets set absolutely unprofessional behavior years almost complete radio silence aside moment yes buy absolutely dont buy still alpha back treasure ithere unnecessary changes make betarelease dreadful slog playplayer progression tied entirely gear adding rng grind ever gear key items like boat climbing shoes glider reins ride animals regionlocked gear next useless soon step region origin immediately lose collected key items enemy balance positioning infuriating time often forcing abuse much stale boring combat compared alpha survive enemy behavior also hasnt changed forcing run good shake might well die respawn honestly pets also dont level anymore skills completely gone get generic artifacts slightly boost swimming speed climbing speed locked behind ridiculously difficult dungeons speaking dungeons often range bullshit even bullshit dungeon white easy name near starting area boss roughly thousands health defeat every enemy dungeon access fun oceans also shrunk immensely sailing huge islands extremely tiny circles dirt grass blocks huge towns extremely rare hope like tiny ass villages engine also got worse reach cpu utilization go fps everything attacks hitboxes npcs projectiles everything gets thrown sync animations play like fpssix years development yeah maybe worked day year dont buy wollays depression ddos anxiety narrative levels nothing gear useless gets disabled try leave starting area without progression play liking game far im actually lets play consider blind literally offset people leaving

backwards alpha leveling feels kind pointless power purely based gear big issue lies find gear used zone found exceptions permanent fix know pretty much games loop kill things dungeonsquests get gear big dungeon artifact end artifacts give level boost one moment options climb speed diving time etc zones two three artifacts time time finish everything zone moment move next area gear degrades tools boat hang glider magic instruments etc taken away basically instead progression game straight diagonal line goes get gear level explore goes moment leave zone drops back repeats know way getting gear last forever matter well argue makes gear feel meaningful youre constantly replacing cool get gear also feature lets put blocks weapons make stronger customize cool kind waste cant keep weapons multiple levels ok youll fine feels like infinite hamster wheel im going anywhere gameplay aside experience playing game couple hours friend something wrong ai npc running walls sprinting away youre trying talk pets anything randomly springing circles worst half time enemies dont react attacked sit nothing kill idk widespread issue friend experienced constantly thought session game wouldnt recommend someone current state someone bought way back sat six years almost nothing im little disappointed result glad wollay actually released something let lesson buying games finished knew six years ago cube world would end becoming wouldnt bought oofdiesat least um make nonactivated death shrines visible map oh cube world long waited say im enjoying time game combat fun enjoy new mobs factions extra pets put smile face however cube world isnt perfect personally three major gripes ill explain later say havent found artifact yet havent leveled say believe cube world worth purchase want get friends wait release believe issues game likely turn away newcomersprosi personally think game looks charming voxel based models environments giving unique look especially like enemies defeated break individual blocksthe combat fun standard action rpg look enemy attack able move classes ive tried berserker guardian warrior flame mage assassin rogue default archer enjoyable specials beat enemies difficulty choose right creatures attack story individual quests random encounters keep player engaged also multiple monsters around small groups really enjoy combat shortage indulge hearts content friendsconsin starting area levels monsters appear completely new decked basic gear monster requires purple gear beat knocks lights outi found guardian specialization boring difficult use single player yes realize guardian water mage specs multiplayer someone wanted see would enjoy playing friends found bit poor impression cannot speak water mage personally without adding new ability spec dont know one could make work singleplayer since current special ability heroic shout supposed taunts enemies makes aggro onto warrior allowing allies take overall would say group guardian warrior use youre better berserker warriorthis major issue time far believe biggest factor newcomer staying game leaving explain game map map zones inside zones individual dungeons quests towns etc find hang gliders boats climbing shoes harnesses order move around quicker also items allow one access areas either locked otherwise inaccessible normal means divine harp spirit bell sky whistle might ones ive found adventures issue leave zone lose items since theyre tied zone youre say youre traveling boat across ocean pass another zone since part ocean happens boat gone reenter original zone wanna continue journey swim manually hang glider youll drop sky cross boundaries using climbing boots allow scale environment without using stamina personally think current system works fine items unlock certain areas also subject system cannot used new zones also find acceptable since gives players another incentive explore new zone questing however find losing ability enhanced travel unacceptable would prefer boats harnesses hang gliders individual items one could find buy quests zone player find stay although think could rarer since believe fair exchange would quests would give transportation options added benefits speed less stamina usage similar armorgear remember correctly gear rarer used alpha im fine im fine gear also tied zone system leave zone found gear said gear stats lowered effectively giving starting gear understand concept behind since every zone almost self contained area makes sense weaker enter else challenge game lost believe wrong way things believe system instead scale current gear level zone youre scaling smaller increments allow player see power increase current zone travel outside zones still strong wont steamroll everything enemies stronger outside also drop stronger gear even lower quality continues advancement player without making feel stupidly weak multiplayer believe zones could scaled depending many players zone time players average gear level idea ideas possible im loathe criticize without coming possible solutionsartifactsafter approximately hours found first artifact say im little disappointed get ill give overview artifacts give passive ability increase random stat ive read mine gives passive increase sailing speednow paper thats fine would ok wasnt fact boats bound zones leave zone im artifact useless find new boat wanted go ocean zone could take long time due slowness normal swim speed gripes artifacts least one easily alleviated making methods transportation locked zones stated abovebugsive found two far one music wont loop correctly im left ambiencethe change keybinds binding dodge g key exit reenter game keybinds reset defaultsside notesthese observations ive major enough put pros consi find nighttime dark since barely see front even lantern think current darkness level works gaves unlit interiors outside believe needs brighter notorious bad eyesight swear hard find statues life around map know unique structure always seem stumble upon accident maybe make map icon look different im surewhen first make character dropped world near statue life environment nearby random think fine believe one given choice spawning spawning town since switch specs intown choice would shorten amount time needed get multiplayer parties set uppersonally believe menu explains classes abilities passives warriors ability enrage heal shift mouse abilities class special ability rock fist heroic shout doi write see add review comments oh man years waiting game gottheres lot comments region

alpha going less fps alphas windows support doesnt exist fans already made unofficial patch fog still likes devour entire planet every progression even worse game current state surprisingly worse alpha years inferior version happened seriously okay lemme get straight much game managed really good launched managed become legit utter shit ill leave opinion hereif youre reading review probably read around right idea whats happening game actually cool useful level ups got changed artifacts well played minutes didnt even really get close get artifact could make sure could get refund backpretty much everything kills fuggin seconds game hell nearly died damm cow cow well didnt enough patience see gear invalidated changing regions literally sold gear one staff wasnt enough damage kill countless hp monsters stayed wayfinal thoughts youre way better buying game state even game even gets better day maybe someone extremely hyped play cube world getting real taste game doesnt

downside practically restart every new zone good thing game right bought back dont pay find shit thing game die progress progress locked region way actually able kill anything going mage see everything screwed people already commented disastrous game design game im going stress another point really think developer left game alpha years without single update commenting twitter year showcase something day max deserves receive support think reward terrible behavior towards people decided put faith himalso review isnt getting counted steam im one people actually supported development since beginning years since alpha game got worse better truth game probably even worked continuously years current state game feels like months work rather years lack work also bad game design decisions region locked gear worst one kills sense progression game thing keep regions shitty artifact stats boring things like swimming speed combat actually less complex satisfying full release alpha wollay said working subclasses class skills skills actually removed instead many examples regression like really excited game back dont want say worth buying thats truth hyped exaggerated devs abandoned game many years ago im sure people expected release seems devs reappearing cash much changed alpha six years ago worse state remains shards fun game lost timeby removing xp

ir para beta ficou acabaram com sistema de level sistema de equipamentos ficou se tornou um jogo e sem posso dar umas para criador jogo ele deveria ter mantido sistema rpg antigo game e acrescentados algumas carateristas atuais e ter deixado os equipamentos plus como permitido mundo inteiro game alem de poder alterar os sufixo dos mesmos equip exemplo sufixo druid para silver sacrificando equipamento que tenha aquele sufixo isso tornaria os equipamentos plus mantendo item drop dos mesmopois se ficar muito perde valor dos mesmosengi bought game played alpha game wonderful going beta horrible ended level system equipment system horrible become simple bland gameif give suggestions games creator kept old rpg system game added current charactersand left plus equipment allowed entire

silence dev plan wise would kept warned people never played cube world hype said gonna changed review ahh played first good continued playing changed mind adn game shit paid alpha back terrible played game first time todayi played hours doesnt feel like much nothing would indicate progression like xp something feel made progress dont feel need kill enemies dont give anything useful money rarely gearyou need search artifacts level leveling doesnt make differencei dont think region locking main problem strongly believe special items like hang gliders boats stuff like shouldnt region locked andor level use itemi dont think game bad definitely needs tuningthere lot amazing ideas subreddit steam discussions improving gameand dont think deserves negative reviewbut game sad feeling itedit writing review release date still hope almost year passed release heard nothing wollay developer changing rating negative many negative reviews yet people play right hmm game cant bad right many things removed apparent reason firstly wrong old respawn system dont find new one fun level deepens frustration teleported across region killed bc dont find looking shrines fun mention exploration killed uncovering whole map region locking every useful gear difficulty also murdered mass genocide bc game difficult region blue gnome quest get decent weapon bc old region doesnt work snorefest let us continue weapons happened spirit cubes bc weapon customisation joke buffs small enough make weapon op nice would slow enemy ice etc another thing got slammed would gliders pet riding unavailable time region even finally get another time worthless would better didnt even bother walked everywhere last time regionthere smaller things dubs anime example keyboard controls layouts feel like put together last minute thought put change liking changed back default start game later gem gnomes thought rare numerous alfa features remained ingame play game like happy really dont hours feels like something force play rather something play enjoyment dont hate dont like itenglish first language find mistake dont afraid let know much bad stuff geezi also bought alpha isnt really bad r e stuff cube world website playing plus gear lets use said item regions gathering artifacts stay level across regions ex faster swim speed find one artifactit isnt bad get use could say game extra steps much potential thats wasted terrible core design progressionthere multiple indications simply cash grab lot people naivedesperate backlash community game lacks much direction supporting game thats boring repetitive emptythis passion project hold years months development game remade name thats even less features theres also reports hackers able obtain information game careful play game online much wasted potential think game could fall far sad literally changedbroke everything good alpha made bad unfun yeah thats fine like waited years gamei hate say im truly disappointed stage cube worlds development id much rather play alpha truly fun want reasons im saying guy explained everything totally agree url gamean actionrpg lite game features classes glass weapon choices weapon chooses bulk attacks also specialization sets passive ability based class example mage class go high damage spec one heals well damagethe game world broken several regions land starting inside random region travel region face enemies broken catergoes difficulty talk npcs quests kill enemies area kill boss similar equipment also drop usually category enemyquest one category higher travel area collect neat items like hang glider sail boat climbing spikes reins use ride pet explore eventually uncover location artifacts current region main goal per region artifacts collected make ride pet slightly faster sail slightly faster glide slightly better dive slightly longer general helping exploreso obviously dont recomend game wrong im sure sounds ok farfirst difficulty scaling rather crazy enemies either tough must exploit game mechanics beat enemy cakewalk easy gear main way becoming stronger good weapon dropping utterly wreck toughest enemiesnotice ive said nothing leveling really level system gain level collecting earlier mentioned artifacts level nothing show many artifacts youve collectedonce leave region reward artifact gear becomes usless low level stuff unless found rare gear called gear keep full effect one region away wherever found itall utility stuff found gliders reins etc also disapear cant even use artifact found manage find new region need put bad difficulty progression loop get quickly boring could play slightly better groupbut game big issue rewarding time artifact true permanent reward effect tiny need find item every region effects actually use despite fact personally want like game cant suggest anyone buy unless gets massive changes going harsh blunt keep mind stop reading review dont want hear negativity think game takes years updated polished part features feel thought mean years come handful new ideas pretty straight forward right wrong wrong wrong start pros alpha game buggy flawed direction therefore feel time version game could also become something polished additionally think exploration game unique different like anything experience outside cubeworld ultimately bought game years ago old system exploration however better things always fixed reverted time indeed tell much add liked removedheres bad lot going explain everything much talk first number one end complaint game directions tutorial guide none played hours still understand purple icon top left corner well nothing mean nothing explained number one complaint alpha version well however alpha definitely straight forward gotten worse next thing also quite concerning perfectly fine alpha quality exploration previously reason fight mobs reason fight enemies lower leveled reason fight mini bosses thats right exploration game enemies worth killing ones higher level dungeons past enemies contributed experience points helped level turn would boost stats skills etc however conventional leveling stat points reason kill enemies additionally mini bosses used drop special cubes used advanced crafting one coolest concepts rpg game might add allowed literally customize weapons block block could boost stats give special status effects like slow incendiary etc blocks dont exist ok cool take one unique features game final critique really empty game feels hear people arguing new system makes want play thats false new system make want quit first region nature game makes beginning real grind alpha hard frustrating rewarding process occurs every time enter new region basically like starting scratch every hours awful hate every bit well thats say hopeful first time years special game would finally come updated wrong isnt cubeworld would happier dreams crushed update ever even happened biggest problem game theres option go back personally wouldve happier playing old version steam connectivity instead got additionally hasnt update since steam release unfortunately safe assume game continue way first actual review steam game im writing disappointment game charts early

armor locked single small part massive world waste time like said lot issues game currently rid gear region locked would make game least playable time beingedit someone made mod game essentially nullifies region locking take credit whatsoever credit user haxifix reddit ill probably redo review detailing missing content lies controversy complete game fundamentals another time lot negativity aimed new almost exclusively gearbased progression system however find intelligent unconventional solution couple problems hard tackle makes every new area challenge without relying kind upscaling new

fromno xp means permanent progression talent tree means youll get pretty repetitive gameplay forevermaybe im rocking heavy nostagia gogles without even realizing hot damn game seems way way worst alpha ive played many years agoalso footstep sounds among worst ive displeasure subjugated high pitched tapping sound youll listen hours walk around empty plains game absolute joke much potential years literally development scam absolute mess enemies around starting areas unkillable one shot gearing joke farming whatever mobs could abusing respawns obtained gear couldnt even use another class tutorial game confusing mess say gamethe lack tutorial means dropped blindly game spend next hours trying wrap head around mechanics thats realize still level go hunting net info discover leveling stripped gameyou see game sad joke downside due lack tutorial takes longer two hours realize messed really thus refundi high hopes couldve darkhorse release instead ended becoming tragedy poor design decisions six year wait never consulting userbase latest version cube world completely deconstructs robust tried true mechanics alpha version game stead replaces dramatically worse alternativesregion locked equipment force bregress continuously every square kilometreb dumbeddown classes thus combat worse world generation much pixelated game map reveals landmass game exploring least exciting permanent upgrades youll ever see video game make poor facsimile cube world much terrible experience alpha game changes baffling even games lot wasted potential atrocious developers like starbound still ended functioning gameplay loopfind alpha want try cube world stay well away release even buying skyrim isecondi time first still much better investment sure alpha wasnt perfect game means developer would earnestly everyone favour replaced current build ill even change review bad hes opaque throughout games history effectively fully finished product updates happening year cube world ultimately dead water happened game playing friend learned every time leave region lose everything lost motivation continue wheres progression game better five years agowhat happen wollay actual fuck bro promised past six years wasnt delivered upon lack communication really killed game waited long without actually knowing waiting hate saying ill refunding wollay actually communicates properly community development going takes feedback point needed save game heard cube world excited play looked like enjoyable experience coming heard bad things wanted optimistic many problems game entertaining regionlocked gear leads incredible hindrance fun game walking new area immediately lose lot progress feels demeaning secondly enemies much damage barely scratch meanwhile even weakest kill hits feel good almost two hours played never encountered dungeon quests laughable best youre playing get feeling whats point finish area go new one start feel pointless repetitive grind end goal even real start point game starts thinking meant even guidance hell skilltree thing wich made character diffrent everyone really dont like change dont hate new version cube world prefer see old features make comebackif developers reading ask get rid region locking system go back old leveling system lot us want version back disappointing initially promised cube world still relatively fun game think replayability limited worst thing buy quite different alpha version release still enjoyable theres lots explore friends solo theres always challenging moments due progression system works nearly bad sounds playing game long stay one specific area great soon run things area decide move next youre met horrible thing thing progress items last area mean absolutely nothing newer areas game gets extremely repetitive first area game feels lackluster region locking mechanic seems getting criticism actually think biggest problem cube world progression rather gradually getting stronger leveled like alpha progression revolves entirely around gear meant first hours every enemy encountered would kill practically looking randomly happened upon yellow boomerangthe highest level proceeded destroy practically every enemy region way killing maybe got incredibly lucky seriously progression like switch flipped went weakest thing region strongestand completing first region cube world expects step another region start back square one except time lamp bit brighter joke bandaid solution think gear lost maybe half power instead entering new region could continue feel like character getting stronger rather rising falling power crossing completely arbitrary border content alpha years ago small see everything hours game spit regions main biome takes min cross one set types quests pieces equipment find hang glider boat improve mobility enemies one shoot begging cheesed actually kill hours barely killing random farm animals might get legendary weapon sweep legendary enemies another hour repetitive quests get piece legendary gear wont class way defeat dungeon clearing final boss legendary impossible beat even full legendary gear mage fry laser pointer seconds melee bosses exact ai cheesed vantage point cant hit else get one shot work get artifact boosts swim speed thats right reward completing dungeon region swim times faster ok lets try next region oh whats legendary gear utter trash weaker starting items pieces equipment found gone right start beginning trash gear equipment get keep new region swim speed theres clear tutorial exact questline encourages travelling around discovering new places collecting new gear old gear become useless game people upset lul make game worse stay away game development near perfect game needed content butchered horrible
