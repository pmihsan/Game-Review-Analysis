requested refundbethesda never list right next easave money save time go something else anything else play trash heap kill good saga put level health bar ennemies destroy infiltrationwill finish paid doesnt deserve price huck faters game lot fun isnt linear wolfenstein ala previous games still huge dose nazi killing large maps great especially dishonored fan biggest downside lack badass metal tunes go hand hand nazi killing huge disappointment wolfenstein went storyline whatever kill things type game every aspects game flawed complete let least one thing right game cost full retail price huge disappointment pre ordered game soon announced thinking good previous titles boring enemies fight every area take million bullets kill dont grind upgrade weapons stats story pretty much non existent dialogue characters awful want great game hours im fun enjoyment playing wolfenstein game friend edit hours later worst game ever played really boring thing build non existent final part game big reveal awful final boss shit wish could get money back absolutely adore game think people dislike wrong reasons starters game wolfenstien different titles make game bad think phenomenal gameplay stellar graphics clunky systems game pretty damn great definitely worth price dont come strict expectations actually enjoy game couple hours hit first boss fight complaints poor companion ai bullet sponge enemies lousy checkpoints hit time unfortunately didnt happen three four hours game doubt ill able get refundduring boss fight boss fires continuous streams missiles aoe damage companion ai likes stand open getting hit go downed state continue stand middle aoe getting shot choice letting die uses one shared lives dying trying revive uses shared life another ai ends dying boss giant enemy soaks massive amount damage barely moving around open arena boss fight takes place theres cover since firing missiles usually fire side cover still damage occasionally regular bullet sponge enemy spawn walk around slowly shooting soaking even ammoand die get reset start level good fifteen twenty minutes earlierim sure leveled side missions boss might much problem according level system already leveled recommended level game going use sort leveling system expect least aware assigning missionsi want like game thought negative reviews overstating ai bullet sponge nature enemies wish negative reviews wrong werentalso softhard armor system enemies ends annoyance anything else weapon switching feels slow compared fps youre constantly switch weapons soft hard armor damage imagine designers wanted players playing coop one person dealing one armor type maybe youre playing someone cooperate system irrelevantthe game look nice runs well least actually liked game graphics nice fighting lot fun protagonists bit annoying bad gunplay works fine new nonlinear way game structures something youll get used generally quite fun especially friend however one thing almost completely kills fun times three towers youll slay way get killed somewhere along way likely especially fight towers boss enemy gotta whole thing woohoo lemme fifteen twenty minutes pretty terrible especially one time died tower boss ai companion refused revive even though wouldve easily able worst thing final boss may expect two phase boss fight first phase damage behind guess side almost never got see finally got phase two whole thing made lot harder fact whole arena chock full standard enemies giving almost place hide bullets probably lot easier friend ai dumber box rocks partner still quite bother conclusion wanna go slay nazis buddy please go maybe wait sale want play game alone think twice recommend game first foremost although exclusively people got friend play want play alone well meh lot fun bad times regret buying end big fan last two wolfenstein games one removed two key features made love games opponents bullet sponges every two minutes shoot opponents way many times die finally move accuracy headshots seem count anymore good shotgun shoot every second opponent around ten times dies makes feel powerless stretches battles point become boring first time wolfenstein game looking forward battle alarm goes pity brilliant shooter feeling two main characters almost every character saw far annoying teenagers andor boring nothing compared well written characters previous wolfenstein parts makes hard identify characters play get emotionally involved story playing story keep feeling would better lay gun get shot teenage girls could annoy bore anymorei could live bad story terrible teenage characters cant live fact destroyed brilliant shooter feeling really hope change back wolfenstein please severly disappointed game many much sad bought youngblood sale loved old

mixed bag game positive negative ill get negative way since somebody reading reviews would want know firstthe characters play pair twin year old girls dont problem gender problem act like year old girls incredibly annoying makes wish silent protaganist general attitude would something expect person going disneyland rather fighting killingthey often goofing taking entire situation lightly example loading screen elevator dancing playing games badly immersion breaking heading take base commanders mecha soldiers making references situation like fictional spy novels fans etc bad way say enjoying game able take targets wish open world way map still sectioned big enough bad level experience impacts damage well enemies damage level adds perks get leveling adds quickly health armor pools take lot weapons feel solid enough fun gib nazi heavy weapon enjoyed wolfenstein games since original dos games many great hours enemy territory say upset game loved idea dual female characters execution bad often annoying play constant going back areas boring combat excitingin lost interest game neat beginning starting enjoy opening story hour two boredom kicked hours game done expected game wolfensteinlike bringing two teenager characters annoying stupid comments bring feeling old game played hour uninstalled requested refund never cared much long reviews keep short straight point game wolfenstein feeling mostly random missions contribute nothing campaign example would annoying rpg heathbar game ridiculously short hours forced play one two annoying teenage girls quite frankly fit game bethesda prehaps could made work poorly introduced feel place know sjwaspect hotly debated forums thought would give take please stop trying feminize games general problem female main characters give games instead destroying old games like wolfenstein game filled bugs peculiar reason bethesda decided add microtransactions fullpriced game opinion never ok given chance would requested refund ground alone game uses combat system previous wolfenstein games make parts game enjoyable adds nothing series summarize stay away game cannot even recommend diehard fans wolfenstein due cons listed sure wolfenstein survive disaster game never regretted purchase one idea hardware game even lowest settings screen turns static mess basically see tv cable never happen even graphically demanding games played max setting graphically intense enough cause run around fps lower also like everyone else says enemies bullet sponges companion ai nothing sit wait kill enemies played intro mission visited first area point impossible talk longevity game whole say things ongameplay wise youd expect new colossus difference mostly new progression system start certain skills youd expect played games already like body slamming double jumping important added verticality new maps also miss certain things need get like ability use heavy weapons dont start diesel gun laser cutter new electric gun used open different areas unlocking doors adds whole expanded maps revisit timethis ties perk leveling system general main new feature added levels level enemies em meaning higher levels nazis kick harder try prevent moving certain areas whatever level killing dealing damage mostly fairly quick perk points awarded theres tech tree things like dual wielding heavy weapons carrying ability health armor buffs mobility upgradesthe second aspect progression weapon upgrades used collectibles upgrade tokens silver coins find em everywhere combined quests seasoned player rack em fairly fast coins spent weapon modifications alter damage range stability stats whatnot also spent cosmetic skins new thing weapons characters skinned ive already seen people complain microtransaction yes game seems premium currency tacked onto yes microtransactions mostly solo game means way consist grind skipper op weapons since theres competitive gamemode striclty cosmetic isnt game mind youregarding coop aspect play one two twins afaik times game ive seen people complain already people cant actually read played game even past intro sequence mean multiplayer start game set matchmaking solo offline online private thats ai partner almost unnoticeable good way ai partner cannot blow cover essentially cloaked combat deals much damage tanks much damage maybe even often outlive go revive moment call death part one thing problem stack three sister lives find containers idea sister life instant revive go self bleed self revive sister life wait die use one sister lives

cave magic jewish artefacts power armor firebreathing robot dogs rightall youd expect wolfenstein aesthetically great soundtrack great acting writing quality tried expand game making less linear mixing elements looter shooters greatly expanded maps get revisit missions secrets side quests pop run havent played game honestly hearing everyone complain isnt single player wolfenstien game typical gameplay bucks barely anyone research anything game game marketed coop spin usual typical nazi killing game honestly minis research tell lol either way agree game sucks golden bars exist cant

refund hope works maybe ive preordered ill remove library wolfenstein wanted play bloody mess hipster bullshit im sure game getting many negative reviews visually gorgeous satisfying hard incredibly rewarding use every mechanic possible outsmart group enemies cheesy full slang dark gory fights combat sooo smoothmaybe people expected something serious maybe cheesiness lost people wolfenstein never meant serious game atmosphere reminds stranger thingsi wouldnt play game damn much fun buddy complements playstyle im sorry really dont know unbalanced piece crud supposed guess ai ok meant enemies swedish nazis werent stupid also guess map design ok meant maps resemble annoying labyrinths wolfenstein guess boils purpose purpose game developers didnt know game trying make theres reason players understand playing eitherin guessing one thing certain ill play game thru even dumb messy im grinding achievement hunter looking coop games reason playing ive finally beat main story one best gaming experiences ive long time shame game getting many negative reviews one best games ive played long time flaws like microtransactions rpg elements mediocre bosses bad partner ai would consider goty material graphics stunning plot brilliantly written edge seat pricetag steal especially compared previous games actual side quests time unlike pathetic ones last games characters great shame game came antibethesda outrage even though didnt much input direction would rate game dont listen haters completely wrong call game bad even mediocre great game least give chanceps fuck give negative review technical problems aside glitches everyone ive played friend kept stepping front shots enjoyed feel different typical wolfenstein game much feel empty times design decent definitely dont mind money spent micro transaction seem bit well rubs wrong way least isnt play win ive really enjoyed previous wolfenstein reboot games really feel dropped ball one gameplay extremely repetitive guns feel wrong didnt expect enemy healthbars little alert signs new bullet type system really slows gameplay maps hard navigate lot time spent trying find objective going way back previous objective see need go back whole game screams microtransactions boosters skins ingame currencies hope doesnt carry next game im mad disappointed ive tried really hard play game cant even consider game cause real games let play havent tried one friends cant even play game stranger cause either bugs immediately get kicked friend buys game start questioning youre friends person want spend hours killing nazis bunch really big guns game triggers common politically ignorant male perpetual state arrested development pushing youre something right first wolfenstein game youll enjoy plenty people complain rpg elements doesnt bother im new series rock paper scissors armor system get tedious reach mid game really doesnt matter strumgewer sniper attachments absolute best part game literally ruined friends experience stealing kills calling loser dont recommend game friends otherwise fan wolfenstein series dont buy disappoint much potential next game new colossus yet came thislame story pointless side missionsthat armor thing enemies use specific weapon type made combat fun frustrating short story well finished less hours average playerlast least cringe dialogues sisters almost time made wonder game actually series wolfenstein new order come expecting something like previous wolfenstein games like severely disappointed expected typical run gun shooter feel powerful halfway decent story telling got bullet sponge enemies semiboring side missions breaking main campaign incredibly irritating protagoniststhe tackedon rpg mechanics need go plain simple dont want level character guns want good single player campaign experience addition god ai partner frustrating limited number lives wouldnt normally problem dumbass ai partner didnt steal upon dying mention theyll occasionally bug ignore reviving youas side note nvidia offers game rtx card purchase case dont know doesnt support raytracing time writing launch day thanks lot machine games call duty already game developers nowdays nuts releasing copies game different textures applied worth time version game lost originality wolfenstain know played previous wolfenstein game great game however assume people buying game played previous game major flaws compared previous games rebooted region map minimap makes locating mission objectives finding commanders finding collectables knowing good paths attack extremely difficult impossible easy mode extremely difficult longer oneshot headshot enemies stealthtype playthrough stealth table enemies take extremely long kill example takes shots bfg kill render distance max still makes horizons look extremely blurry crappy seems like major oversight since major storypoints game towers look large region map upgrades new weapon customization make significant differance weapon seems like fluff real enemies respawn entirely quickly example leave region map half city block step another region directly adjacent go directly back everyone spawned back note need take step new region old region respawn incredibly annoying since many region seen windows doors enemies alert position even different regiontldr minimap useless single path instead openworld stealth impossible gun customization mostly filler like mindless boring go bad liked wolfenstein games hate one liked previous wolfenstein reboot games youll mostly like one tooits coopfirst built game awesome playing coopthe rpg elements bit open level tokens money earned rather progression tasks unlock stealth bit harder least low level enemies immune one hit kills silenced guns lots situations need coordinated attack coop partner keep stealth isnt possible ai playerit still stealth issue someone walking around upstairs dance club music going triggers looking sounding alarm theyll forget youve killed pile people want decent co op

fine could better could worse youre side missions stuff going cakewalk think ive lost one two shared lives throughout whole game singleplayer armor type system sort annoying invest upgrades doesnt really matter think supposed add new layer gunplay ended annoying rock shoe critical would definitely missed elevator doors opening simulator caution please note really interested buying remember following buy coop buy sales use buddy pass friend could play games demo version bokay forward note idea make coop shooter bases upon interesting campaign environment gunplay quite interesting wolfenstein series definitely gunplay large ocean opportunities gameplay eg different enemies course storytelling suffers large losses coop oriented game however cares game fun buddy also essential coop makes everything fun really cannot understand youtubers bought game single player purposes accuse fun give spoiler game awful points armor mechanic largest issue game ridiculous stupid mocks gameplay completely enemies two types armor squares go heavy armor rectangles go believe light armor weapons also rectangles squares weapon corresponds toa specific armor type order kill opponent need pick correct weapon problem squares weapons totally ineffective rectangles load full shotgun clip enemy would still alive getting worse dieselcraftwerk explosions cannot efficiently kill enemies square armor moreover imagine blast way command post hold square weapon first enemy rectangles run away switch weapon enemies switched positions need switch weapon back die lot simultaneously attacked two enemies different armor type sounds funny reality game majority playtime changing weapons core mechanic spawns issue game enemies spawn nowhere especially break stealth appear right nose add

also invisible also funny efficient weapon humans melee one two shots everything point cosplaying chivalry worked better gunplay played hard gameplay boring forced destroy endless waves enemies thing entertained us hilarious clunky animations also leveling doesnt feature anything special unique typical stuff like armor etc one thing higher difficulties enemy two levels higher shotted even full health interactions players opening doors activate switches dancing reviving thats tight cooperation plot characters stupid illogical dad missing need visit paris takedown three super towers also like twins notice reason according shape house one room nobody noticed abi came reason william disappear also lazy cant find logical reason gone say hes gone missing doesnt want found always nobody cares helicopter flies near zeppelin paris twins quite disgusting behaviour one really weird laughs jokes like ten years old kid second one seriously lacks character development simply exists plot needs twist characters disappear completely vanish protagonists make illogical stuff germans always criengie cartoonish typical evil speeches right tv shows lets honest nobody cares plot game exists know william disappeared need find meanwhile something something important impact world conclusion bad even coop game know coop makes everything fun would say guns sound impact pluses game even
