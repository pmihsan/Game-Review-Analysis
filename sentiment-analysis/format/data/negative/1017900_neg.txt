pathfinding little bugs quality life upgrades make game bit tolerable game suited well online play campaigns ai matches enjoyable play favorite thing remaster unit design cavalry chariots legions etc especially war ships look really good didnt realise terrible game back day didnt like graphics gameplay campgain bad buy terrible customer service considering deleting steam altogether easy mode enemy attacks minutes gorillion elephants ok figured focus military next time economy raise mighty army archers hoplites cavalry siege weapons much immediately attack enemy beginning win gorillion army elephants extra armor appear nowhere obliterate basically unbeatable campaign mode cant even progress second level easy mode far difficult dont time patience passion waste many hours playing monotonous game appease devs epic game real time strategy better simpler total war yet still fun eu jogo age empires desde seu sempre tive um carinho muito grande pelo rise rome e quando tomei conhecimento remaster definitive edition tive em comprar minha surpresa foi que coisa que melhoraram em ao na minha foram som e de certa forma os que permitem uma maior burrice artificial das unidades assustadora importa se cavalos ou elefantes eles travam nada enroscam uns nos outros e se movem que delete pelo menos um deles diverti um pouco desde que comprei mas geral estou desmotivando muito rapidamente e com vontade de reinstalar de even easy mode game tough players addition fact review section doesnt even spellcheck makes even pathetic even easy ai rushes sides within minutes getting iron age giant sized map players every single game get flooded enemy players even last last place scorewise tried every difficulty one plays exactly literally difference easy hardest bodes true campaign custom maps absolutely ridiculous problem since release single update addressed problem unplayable trash extremely disappointing fan aoe franchise since years old first let say graphics sound outstanding team great job brings back lot nostalgia unfortunately quickly ruined horrible ai pathing click group units go attacked clicked others wander attack something random ai tough even easy theyll work together take even theyre team manage get based youll find villagers standing around enemy units corners map anything maps little resources youll run gathering everything creating small army die stale mate cant finish game hopefully stuff gets fixed dd coming im doubtful save money hopefully dd better anyone wondering whether buy game wait months see bugs fixedthe crashes errors bad

atorados el de jugadores se puede rebasar diferencia de la muy molesto que pesar de que les indiques que se queden en determinado lugar los sacerdotes especialmente los personajes tienen la mala costumbre de hacer lo que se les plazca xd pero bueno es aoe la nueva es hermosa en el apartado los escenarios mejoraron es un deleite verlos el agua sus texturas los animales las ballenas uufff pero

age empires always wanted think game looks worse original units looks like style wallace gromit clearer graphics see every unit clone eachother looks exactly ruins realism think game unfinished yet animations really poor etc tried really hard enjoy game cannot recommend get downgrade every single aspect imaginable firstly ai dogshit amount times ur vills afk get stuck rock tile astounding secondly lack commands units results heap frustration enemy boats units seeping thru ur defences cos u cant patrol ur army protect anything quite annoying also hate enemy ai like sort tunnel vision maphacks constant swarms enemy units seemingly homing missles ur villagers matter map really slows progress ur vills constantly getting massacred game slow lack end game upgrades makes taking enemy bases bit tedious play max speed campaign missions still mostly take hour beat u usually end slowly advance towers enough soldiers protect siege units stop going suicide towers protect cav charges reset whole process successful noticed going navy seems best thing almost always costs wood boat armies water supremacy saves constant transport raids killing ur vills boats anniliating ur eco yeah icing cake forced hand negative review frustrating campaign mission taking hour complete rise rome lvl finally assaulting enemy base random defeated shows enemy army eco left clue sure pissed enough finally admit game worth time get let nostalgia memories keep afloat instead playing soiling fond memories hey pretty thats disappointed game maybe thats misalignment expectations developers id done

strategy enjoyable mindlessly build civilization destroy another im going go ahead give game lukewarm review played original age empires back day simply want hd remaster go ahead buy sale like spent ten bucks received many hours entertainment game however youve never played game id much rather recommend one later age empires titles ii iii game terrible mechanics havent aged well frustrating gaming experience example ai ai terrrrrrible soldiers dont theyre told go way way perform simple task theres way program troops ships citizens perform tasks according importance basically micromanage everything else empire collapse ive many cheap deaths due crappy ai loss productivity due massively flawed ai flaws include population capacity along inability destroy ships especially true fishing ships take population theyre done fishing theyre basically waste population would think would fixed many issues remaster simply graphical upgrade game still broken twenty years ago like said fond memories playing game back late early quite enjoyed remake youre new series though strongly recommend ii starting point fixes many flaws original game much enjoyable gaming experience im still looking pathfinding game bad ive change review due recent changes old problems still persists ive playing aoes since long time ive never poor experience aoe hell even enjoyed original issues one oh christ one worst aoe ever come even worse villagers get stuck around gathering applies military units send go command extremely annoying carried original one fixes ever done guess devs considered feature rather bug ever since pop limit several campaign missions renders shit economy translates lagging behind ai several areasnormal speed mode rather slow uninspiring select fast get hammered hard already ahead ai oh say researched techs alreadymovement several military units rather slow melee units hardly catch cavalrychariots ranged unitsthats think right maybe devs worked issues rather called support screen would wayyy betterthats say good graphics never means good game definately applicable hereoh cant disable shitty narrator campaign id stay away rather play newer de like age empires think game still nice except bad ai like play single players games youre fine playing game multiplayer gameplay horrible crashes everytime husband try play game together forgotten empiresxbox game studio fix game poor costumer service managed run game quite hard really funi played mac running parallels windows cinematics choppy starting game change settings lower specs run smoothlyif arent sure game runs setting dont buy played original know changes modern graphics theres also new soundtrack minor changes uiplayability civ balance completely remade campaign maps opinion worth sale price full price considering original still runs windows much much faster lowmiddle end computersvisuals everything gorgeous change zoom level settings even detail gorgeousness giving playability cutscenes replaced voiced actors instructionssoundmusic sounds remade completely original sound replaced rerecorded variants keeping essence original sounds making less repetitive music rescored lost magic wayplayability standard features added gather points autorebuild farms hotkeys depend position button ui units name think reconfigurable units may walk farms possible original changes appreciated civilization bonuses changed slightly better mp balance play random maps using assets want visual features broken ie look worse aoeror example trees shade water waves etc even mode still requires specs de run much worse original older systemscampaigns campaign maps tend follow structure originals havent checked identical sans visual enhancements least similar shape feel maps completely remade didnt feel anything missing noticed maps new gave freshness gameoverall preserves essence original modern graphics audio hard justify paying already original curiosity war time game still ridiculously addicting shameful really eaten urinated hours idea children ive conquered known world half dozen times good game disappointing buggy error error pathfinding ridiculously badnot sure even bought lol download original pains give game negative review thought moved past hd remasters bugs original ai path finding moronic third campaign level soldiers wouldnt attack enemy villagers werent nostalgia factor would completely give game mess cannot stress broken game restart campaign level music previous play keeps playing next game music somehow enemy troops double spawn completely obliterate every time want restart level exit entire game awful select soldiers send fight get glitched toghter cant move im running enemy dont move get killed easily ive lost lot unites way comfy game thats year old talking first game played pc aoeit suffer year old game engine issues expected add nice quality life features present like queues walkable farms etc thats nicepathfinding absolute shit original one feature didnt add formations ai absolute garbage trading bad original shit original still shit hereall would recommend good overall nostalgia bothers end would change villager build menu iconsyou dont even get cool intros used get launching game could introduced mechanics aoe ii ai comes alliancesenemiesin original version could get around making everyone teams locked teams setting onin de seems attack way swarm first kill youi swear ms poor resource management reason picked game bundle deal already aoe ii de comparable successions even improvements de version mean civs unique features even wonders shared pretty much much remember years back positive negative sense right memory lane first pc video game ive seen child looks pretty draw back pathfinding lack variety unit models strange think creators made rubbisheven definitive edition game commands crap everything game sucks game improved graphics cheats pathfinding issues whats love timeless classic pathing awful makes sense still recommend reallllly fix bad pathing villagers get stuck take really long routes resources often bought played like hours games aoe really old game remember nice experiance im sure huge maps huge music lacks magic ancient times sounds like happy utopia lacks war drums feeling keep playing original aoe soundtrack bettergraphic pretty nice comparing old one ofc ui looks like finished fast catch deadlineworst thing game noticed pathfinding units blocks time hard anything units get close stand like braindead zombies willing move seconds move pathfinding damn units something easy apply game another design really annoying make group soldiers try give orders keep roaming around stupidly click click every second fix attempts suicide even worse fact group units want move closer usually click point map waiting till hug area get formation way man dont even try click move order group keep spread move little left right want swordsmen stand one next manually move every single one matter long click move order wont gather pointedit time playing big change dont remember like original aoe like upgraded arrow turrets cannot fast kill one slinger something wrong looks like sake balance made towers super weak ridicilus cavalery units ride base ignore turrets check much turret deal damage unless u upgrade balista civilisation useless never aoe pro remember original game gave fun im constantly losing games lowest difficulty setting bit annoying thats reason difficult settings let weak players interesting game pros even finally win something doesnt really give fun spamming units somehow u ai hard way terrible stupid another example zig zag wall labirynth way base many turrets beside like enemy units follow damn zig zag getting hits turrets wasting resouces instead proper siege catapultsthis game bad cheers la idea de hacer un de del age es excelente pero hay cosas que lo siguen haciendo injugable resolvieron desde la edicion de fines de los una decepcion ya que las civilizaciones diferente jugabilidad que tiene con el age ii podrian haber hecho valer la pena lack buildings gates well sad laggy bad looking ui really annoying prefer original old one looks pretty ai dumber bag rocks dont remember game bad childhood love converting enemies love game shame theres pissing sound initial cut scenes love game far usually write review putting time game seeing many negative reviews people saying crashing issues errorsbugs yet receive crash desktop witnesses bugs game smooth tutorial custom matchesthis game blast brings back used look forward getting home school play look forward getting home work getting kids bed allowing hour relive game know getting grab love game brings back many memories im little disappointed sometimes game crashessave often many core aspects game fantastic new graphics gameplay functionality wonderful manages bring back childlike nostalgia years ago great upgrade original game series except feel one glaring flaw unfair ai scriptsafter hours playing game say certainty ai designed play according rules game one thing always know units times despite never building using scout explore map theyll know soon ready forces defenses weakest proceed somehow walk right defensive perimeter full opposing units strike villagers hidden somewhere inside territory ive tested villager run across map far lineofsight much slower military units ai perfectly follow villager across map back human players unit loses los unit give meaning ai get play los leads ridiculous situations attack villagers far away places shouldnt even know thereon top playercontrolled units seem behave differently aicontrolled units whereas ai units spread attack normal units often get stuck randomly wander units often get stuck unable move units end partially inside ai dont seem problem despite base units buildings close proximity another issue sometimes units ive put defensive stance randomly wander location ive tasked despite absence enemy units pick move another location beyond defend areain last match played writing also issues units retreating opposing unit theyre melee squad hoplites retreat one nearby range elephant archer one number shot arrow know normal melee units attacked range defensive stance entire group move unusual especially remake old game well within defensive area attack enemy comes itlastly wouldnt surprised find ai receive free resources throughout match seems new standard numerous realtime strategy games like dawn war series age empires series halo wars series company heroes series etc past years even old games updated way im guessing easier way program ai developers wouldnt bad thing especially like seeminglyimpossible challenge theres way turn benefit even lowest difficulties someone trying learn play rtss steep learning curve cant one feels wayi hope game rtss include better fairness difficulty controls future video games like one need accessible cant keep modern gamer people disabilities illness etc still want enjoy beautiful piece history less classic game theres wonkiness ais pathing times option use old music limited use old art style worth giving try youve never played movement

process diewhy pathfinding terrible every unit military otherwisealso got archers skirmish archers dont worry enemy villager walks past battle archers switch target guy clearly greater threatgood nostalgia though wont refund yet see improves come may played gem long final de editionthis version makes game soooo much better looks great plays wellwas hoping though edition tendency ones units go village idiot mode totally ignore orderscommit suicide stupidity might addressedoh well nothing perfectand proper formation buildingcontrol appears beyond still give poor perfomance overall nostalgia keeps game alive im getting tired lagging everytime fight prone stuttering lag late game lot units computer easily meets recommended system requirements excuse really refund requested refunded sadly recommend crash minutes inform either firewall security anti virus causing clash game turning security systems play game safe refunding game choose latter wait aoe next year better problems riddled bugs unacceptable point time game straight launching game playing notice several bugs overall lacks polished finish original vastly betrays definitive edition tag even talking ai general lack features present game rerelease release even par standard set aoe hd edition much better job meant crippling bugs fps mentioned others seriously dented hopes recommended runs well fun play bored sadly definitive edition doesnt update everything todays standards still outshined sequel age empires iithings began couldnt see thing due tiny ui changed scale ui game reset every time started game seriously manually change file settings readonly keep ui scalebut bigger issue campaigns campaigns population limit time simply way low cant build strong army keeping good economy cull villagers make room army destroy whole navy even likely troops arent enough get troops front ai hopefully economy still strong enoughthere also missions start army navy three villagers order make villagers youd build town center ten houses wood town center destroy whole navy reduce number houses needed start chopping wood three villagersi also want mention first mission babylon start single priest wander around trying find someone convert found villager started convert max range game randomly decided villager would enough kill priest mission failed things cause missions unnecessarily lenghty boring truly missed chance simply perfect nostalgia took alreadydont mind negative comments regarding unit pathfinding ai remastered game decided maintain gameplay mechanics old game greatand dont expect mimick good overrated sucessor aoe first game series far really enjoying game one problem fixed reason update last problem im isnt worst simply sound ever music well anythingthe game still lot fun though sound thing enough keep away entirely subjective review absolutely love definitive edition less hd remaster leaves much original game untouched enjoy imperfect glory said old problems still nostalgia goggles block right solo comprar por nostalgia xd es muy jugable tiene problemas de balance el pathfinde es solo play although buggy really fun either skirmishing ai playing historical campaigns however multiplayer long dead buy want play friends old problem solved though pathfinding still problem comes better hope next patch add new civilizations unique units somehow worse original sat cd case shelf first map units getting stuck path finding seems worse ever units responding orders bit like ccedit memory bit hazy played c years im pretty sure priests would heal units next clicking heal rather walk half way round map first said unit doesnt move im also pretty sure units didnt randomly walk map attacking even defensive status set attacking enemy edit yet issues unit animations glitching mainly elephants best invisible priests wondering earth units firing priest suddenly appears dying animationedit ice skating priests moving across map without animationshame really stupid hard beat campains fun experience enjoyable time playing first age empires game definitive edition first game problems terms walls gates sequel games allow gates gate issue didnt encounter bugs slow lagi recommend anyone really enjoys first age empires game well wants get rts gene wish could say age empires definitive edition since already problems terms slow lag crashes try custom made games whole bunch problems hard defend problems say get first game age empires definitive edition first wait age empires definitive edition actually fixes problems terrible remasteri dont remember movement units bad think original game much fluid ai crazy stupid units often get stuck great game hours fun ai terrible cant even play campaign reason bought game always resign complete objectives ai pathfinding bad ais bit stubborn sometimes classic classic absolutely insufferable unit movement kills game buy enjoy babysitting stuck units game god awful pathfinding doesnt allow build gates instantly refunded get game wait aoe definitive edition instead game much fun sync error issues make virtually unplayable disappointment almost conquered several lans game times error end suddenly game unplayable buy without patch ai extremely aggressive easiest modes makes game impossible beat fun even max population army wasnt able beat one enemy first scenario easy buygoogle reviews game complaining difficulty settings game buggy multiplayer private lobby invitations dont work game nice nice graphics nice sounds musicbut controls game control dreadfulthe units bad pathfinder get stuck time others units environmentthe units always ignore commands attack walk enemy sighti dont recommend version game wall gate option bad game performance terrible old builds used run better pc whats going game worked well time since recent update friend get sync error multiplayer occurs anywhere minutes hour primary reason purchasing game play multiplayer frustrating error occur midway game games simply shuts seconds launch tried every thing bad graphics game play outstanding sometimes troops lack discipline like environment well nothing really bad game graphics music nice worst ai ive ever seen life roadmap soldiers drew move incredibly awful act go one end map graphics looks nice couple extra features like reseeding farms also nice game stuck past every annoying way able set behaviour newly made units etc also picked new issues units getting stuck upon lot previously bad thing game lack players reason play game curiosity horrible path finding boring campaigns civilizations pretty much much aoe pathfinding even broken original release smh pathfinding awful remembered thanks upgrading guysalso menu looks worse original game generallypoor glad ended great pity abou pathing game atrocious remember correctly much worse original version half time units go opposite clicking enough deem game unplayable broken theres glitch motion units get stuck encounter twice almost every game disappointing aoe fan theres genesis good game game age empires given ready availability much active player base better place go historic rts actionage empires worth time nostalgia value first rts ever played fond memories balance gameplay standards sequels civ plays similarly minor bonuses distinguish unique units techs real differences strategy mostly boils cosmetic variations strategy also lacking theres limit strong counter units trash units defences generally poor lack gates mean leaving walls open get units saving grace pathfinding terrible units often struggle get anyway course goes way though often youll find units getting killed half gotten lost trying walk around small rock also retain relative positions manually group get separated bad pathfinding thats mention units different move speeds seperate walking leaving likes priests siege units vulnerable shame couldnt adressed various formation functions couldnt added new edition youre remaking game add useful functions since proved games seriesthen course multiplayer games available many may difficult get game region get variable quality none matches played ranked could often get games crushed opponent crushed next game top lack early game defences like town center garrisoning means theres alot early game rushes deal several team games one player would villager rush knock another player entire team would fold issue due low numbers players teams discord several games played team matches find one member team fact group friends discord turned ally secure easy victory teams werent locked happen games like mention low numbers multiplayer make much worsehonestly ill end repeating said start go play age empires instead took amazing game ruined extremely poor unit mapping game inefficiently written major lag get anywhere near unit cap even bother trying put large group units together get stuck nothing sit middle battle killed game way back learned real time strategy original really hopping managed pull upgraded version usual ruin could great sad game bring back many memory still bad pathing problems however still recommend rts fans game bring back old day game still classic sadly new thing like campaign new civilization game still great game brings back feel nostalgicthe first rts ive ever played damn gooooodpros upgraded graphics looks amazing stuff really made well villagers walk farms bit smarter original units look awesome wololo multiplayer alivecons pathfinding units get stuck sacrifice one others move alone get really annoying especially preparing battle achievements get glitched points restart steam couple times get popped count progressioni rate game game make playing original less headache still original complete problems pathing fixed units randomly spawn buildings cant move ai terrible unless plan playing multiplayer games buy like original ai ffa work ends even easy impossible ally ai destroys ffa nondiplomatic games ai vs exists ai even stand attack despite forced enemies ai inconsistent hard ai ai never aged minutes others face moderate ai seems achieve villager lead minute mark making seem like ai cheating count resources rather follow script produce game pure nostalgia trip nothing didnt impove ai still one worst seen game besides minute rush offers nothing frequest crashes normal point game visually pleasing essential aspects needed addressed make game bearable play years path finding pathetic best units still formations theyre blinding walking around like morons even though together unit dont understand developers lazy couldnt implement feature playing trying come back abysmal waste money game worthless aside graphically enhancing nothing fixed many things made worse neither campaign standard game hardest difficulty enemy either rushing instantly building towers next village centre defeating war elephants defense play setting hardest difficulty standard game campaign unwinnable even lowest setting game easy enemy sits play someone whos afk game utterly broken difficulty scaling either win enemy inactive absolutely curbstomps youfurthermore game bugged units frequently run get stuck moving take roundabout path straight path freely availablethe game utterly unplayable would demand refund possible buy something obviously tested game keeps crashing new update really annoying game still rules played first released odd yrs ago im playing youngster get rts started beautiful remaster original aoe damn bad understand staying true origins idea make modern beautiful didexcept one major flaw modernize important parts adding advanced commands like formation movements etc worst part path finding simply terrible units get stuck trying push buildings way soldiers get stuck damned tree unable move anywhere manually moved around stupid tree would send army attackmove command enemy base move stand perfectly still completely ignoring enemy units buildings would fight someone attacked directly units directly attacking units move come aid unless manually aggressive stance help allit beautiful remake original aoe damn terrible play buy full price hurt less realize little time spent optimizing important parts strategy game actually moving units attacking others ready micromanage every single damned unit since get stuck trees buildings units etc also time forgetting fight enemies classic game issue going back playing years later different game fast paced idea whats going yet nuts horrendously optimised buggy remaster looks decent runs poorly high end systems cant run consistently computer ram gtx lot bugs units glitching getting stuck music stopping playing single track countless complaints games performance forums developers havent done much address also havent bothered improve anything original example primitive unit grouping ai still bad used buy unfinished garbage easily one favorite games childhood quite possibly defining part life first rts ever played courtesy grandmother got package deal new laptop time dumped many hours years im older actually know hell im makes even fun game started became pc gamer many years ago game ever played game grandfather pc gaming personal opinion many people try compare game modern releases get upset much missing point rerelease pure nostalgia want part pc gaming history play game difficult therefore frustrating unbeatable game hours wasted useless heap shit go fuck unfortunately old unitgame defaults still active units automatically attack buildings units even aggressive stance turned game intuitive aoe ii would thought graphics redone text would little bigger clearer menu would simple shortcuts game selection navigation exist later models missed opportunity make game playable example build market building farms upgrade walls building granary smooth enjoyable play aoe ii unit movement incredibly buggy units take extremely long route destination shorter routes momentarily blocked eg another friendly unit passing narrow passageway units often refuse get transport boats even standing right next worst units sometimes get stuck together map meaning neither unit move spot makes game incredibly frustrating play units get stuck lot especially military units get stuck friendly military units spamming rightclick opposite directions sometimes unstucks way often kill free others bug destroys game experience significantly pathfinding general really bugged sometimes units run huge detours get point next without obstacles way spamming rightclick seems fix time really annoying units keep getting stuck map sometimes end attacking army reach target unplayable player really slight graphics update original game tracking errors annoying lack features would recommend unpolished game many bugs units constantly getting stuck example ai feels dumber original sad see lack care ruin couldve possibly great remake unstable keeps crushing without error report visuals indeed lot better however gameplay still badnot changedthe way units never group together moving somewhere units stuck behind treerock reasonyour catapults killing armyi would say worth money unable create lobby due server overload someone using one server u r using welcome bug empires seriously im fan aoe version lot different units stucking trying attack enemy stuck gathering building catapults always killing troops cant help ask unit attack specific building quickly jumping another warfront coming back trying gather troops notice got seperated lost stuck middle way fuck shit well done update old classic realtime battle game well say game run windows reeallyin opinion real shame ms company big move mean adding extra code game exclude bullshitbad review fix propably never fuck game ran lot disconnection failures really bad experience game issues well documented still aoe thus quite fun many qol changes make game playable personally hated need micro original considering villagers said bugs short couldve much better would wait sale bad game opinion graphics gotten new makeover noticeable improvements ai dumb rocks manage use weapons unless youre looking pvp id look elsewhere seriously giving ai handicap hardest difficulty dont sound installing sounds hell keep disabling god damned narrator every time start game two separate versions first bought aoe de microsoft store multiplayer dead arrival later bough game store hoping xbox achievements automatically unlock steam counterparts oh well probably much handle devs finally found aoe de twice xbox account ms store version represented colourless logo steam version coloured logo versions sets exactly xbox achievements well duhgameplay aoe aged well game officially postwall gates garrisonable towers town centers something like fortresses thus almost every ai raid big potential turn immediate worker drone slaughter creators minimum terms improvements like idle worker button farmland farmer actually walk outside everything stays ai know excactly start pathfinding still worse ant computer screen army formations remain something ancient people werent able fathom lizard brains according gamenations feel unique old tired architecture sets wonders widely shared unit types every single nation seems like greeks roleplaying hittes babylonians egyptians name basically counts cultural appropriation much
