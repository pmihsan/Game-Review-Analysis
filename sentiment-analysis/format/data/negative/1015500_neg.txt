reccomend unless get cheap price like bought preorder disappointed bought worst version history dev pissed lowering fixedbody bug fixednew bug blurry screen finish move bought game hulk hogan havent played wrestling game since figured couldnt bad everyone saying wasthe game play never really buggy animation issues things like hogans bandana stretching acrossed whole screen people weird things ropes fine started creation stuff swear god game crashed desk top much almost isnt even playable creating videos entrances pretty much anything wasnt going post negetive review fun ridiculous almost wish didnt even buy bought black friday let tell ya even worth dollarsgoods myplayer story okaycons buggy game crashing time make superstar crash play myplayer crash run universe mode crash crash crash crash day long poor console port game cant go fps capped game use full power graphics card bought sale refund bear mind aware game buggy hell constant crashes sale wanted see true fixed seems fix muchwhile game ran fine slowdowns low fps things bothered needed refund one constant crash desktop finishing one single combat another one almost irrecoverable crash wasnt able close application trying create characterif think cyberpunk buggy almost wins little prefer play back wwe buy insteadavoid game even sale unless fix crashes brought game around march first wrestling game played since wwe ever played game universe mode community creations didnt really care featuresi reason stupid enough buy opposed hear better sale digital deluxe instead fact feared servers could deactivate time making pointless buy full price aware announced servers still run foreseeable future wouldnt count ityes awful price hoping fixed many issues almost devs abandoned game soon came many issues include frequent crashes long loading screens universe mode pain limited terrible community creation since good creators either console play many issues listed loading times especially entering community creations take minutes load crashes frequent crashes occur middle ppv event universe mode seriously mess ppv match card game restarted crash example title matches could become nontitle matches originally planned hell cell match becomes regular match one crash play though ppvs turn entrances reduce chance game crashing elimination chamber matches seem broken universe mode many cases players walk though pods like ghosts also irish whip someone chamber cage wall start glitching start clipping cage wall many cases universe mode one superstars cannot selected rivalry storyline example aew universe mode roster wanted create rivalry jon moxley lance archer reason lance archer wasnt even listed option even though involved existing rivalry double check part roster community creations terrible terms quality quantity around pages custom wrestlers choose actually good heard community creations console versions much better since good creators console fact large majority player base seemingly play example want create aew roster universe mode create colt cabana hobbs eddie kingston since could find community creations even though console versions would likely multiple versions short community creations steam version pretty much dead nothing trash creations uploadedi think safe say worst wrestling game ever played buy would either wait released assuming turn good buy assuming online features deactivated future cant believe reached seem gone backwards game development played game twice crashed twice ill fire trusty comes pain thats never let fact thats game nutshell let cant play game always crash modestay away shit could look past piss poor looking faces new controls didnt crash like crazy didnt would bad horrible dont waste money dont expect much games still let dont care theres new features roster terrible anything wanted game work right yet couldnt even get wwe games never quality standards embarrassing dont think bad game wwe forced early release nothing wrong core game multitude bugs glitches brings downprovided willing pay extensive postrelese work patching fine christmas good dont buy ended canceling preorder negative feedback game discounted around dollars tax honestly think less disgusted gameplay matches universe ended starting streaming series game twitch facebook completion falls count anywhere match john cena barron corbin soon went show post match highlights game crashed warning shut game released last month fact cannot get right still boggles hope fixed think purchasing game franchise long hands gave second chance dumb game slow overall new animations look weird fast cartoonish hair physics roster messed created superstars works okay creating anything pain dying hair broken color select color end cant change lightning entrances cause even though select wont show actual entrance game keeps crashing even patches please dont stick got many issues confusing got released played undisputed era adam cole takes shin guard doesnt even hit finisher leg cannot come group undisputed era often way make entry work reverses nonexistent computer reverses everything even turned ai reverse test matches start wo full health entrances shit graphics shit game shit waste game especially want go back save wwe games one pc bad good used really laggy normal heard horror stories took risk worth every penny career mode
