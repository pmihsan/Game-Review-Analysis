slime balls umbrellas game fight multiple bosses collect multiple weapons build amazing structures go hell back game kill bunnies sword game spend hours digging virtual dirt addictiveget game waste time game particularly excel anything besides obnoxious waste timeforemost combat system unsatisfying shallow mess players awkwardly move around two dimensional space clicking enemies death struggling avoid damage limited mobility players enemies dont attack lazily designed deal damage touching player thus combat encounters involve player even reacting enemy attacks instead perpetually attempting keep away awkward computer enemies gravitating towards enemies bounce dig float jump around incoherently blatantly inconsistent patterns often far agile player every time player gets hurt get knocked around turning combat spastic mess enemies knocking player around player struggles click death even uncommon player get stunlocked completely overwhelmed enemies point functioning isnt even possible anymorethe game aggressively respawns enemies constantly point player often cannot even perform tasks area perform every four actual seconds player spends want spend least twenty seconds fighting enemies respawn system decides calm moment every structured task player perform area mind numbing chore bloated numerous time spent fending perpetual enemy spamthe game makes player perform lots chores besides every boss following basic trial error based attack pattern generally possible players fight bosses naturally players little mobility bosses like enemies much player must build entire arena fight boss players build multiple completely different places different biome locked bosses mentioned one player spends eighty percent time fighting enemies try even finished spawn boss outside extremely limited random encounters players need grind resources create item spawns bosses disappear player doesnt spawn night turns day fight often regular mobs even invade boss arena risk getting player killed messing combat pattern since mobs already already spawned wander fightsometimes players cant even fight boss game wont stop spawning enemies nearby player never clear boss arena begin fight without combat pattern interrupted single mob sometimes enemies shoot projectiles player screen sometimes enemies teleport player immediately damage sometimes enemies fall screen land player instantly enemies camp inside physical objects impossible player hit bosses spawn projectiles move faster player possible purposely avoid since player movement game atrocious absolutely balancing conscious effort put making combat remotely fair enjoyable lazy simply coded extremely recycled clicker gameplayplayers trade absurd amount different merchant characters player individually build house order gain access thus yet player must perform pointless chores find nowhere games build dozen houses basic access merchants even chores allowed features games give player default without wasting timethe effectiveness player massively influenced gear modifiers players find craft items assigned modifier make better worse average order measure later game enemies early game enemies playing higher difficulty players reroll gear modifiers get optimal ones random chance diceroll players go individual pieces equipment costs lot players grind money gamble right able survive higher tier content players grind get rare random boss drops grind get rare random enemy drops perhaps spend another chunk time holding cursor button mindlessly dig earth search random loot somewhere blank expanses dirt rock randomly dying instant kill traps barely visibleplaying lowest effortless difficulty setting generally advisable due ineptly game designed combat coherent mow enemies instantly especially infinitely respawning youre trying finish building boss arena bosses poorly designed need build entire zone somewhat playable fight rigid trial error patterns single random enemy interrupts dance die grind money sink colossal amounts currency gambling get decent modifiers equipment even surviveatrocious nearly every functional aspect obviously atrocious many hoops players jump make game remotely playable versus games playable start building multiple arenas fight bosses building numerous houses trade merchants gambling get useful equipment digging dirt hours get resources ludicrous

werkzeuge und viele gegner bosse und errungenschaften damit einen nie langweilig wird viele kleinigkeiten zum beispiel der musik und sounds jedes biom und vieles mehr eine sache mich jedoch seit den update terraria und steam nach einer zeit ab und das wird von mal zu mal immer das bezieht sich darauf dass die welt bei den letzten speicherpunkt wieder und die gesammelten items weg sind zum beispiel man bei der sonnenfinsternis man die ganze zeit und bekommt das zerbrochende schwert und dann terraria ab es ist richtig deprimierend hoffentlich kommt ein patch aber sonst richtig cooles spiel game cool many weapons armor tools course many enemies bosses achievements one never get bored many nice little things example smooth transition music sounds every biom much one thing however bothers since update terraria steam staggered time time time often refers fact world loaded last memory point collected items gone example one solar eclipse fight time get broken sword crashes

actualizaciones que superen las anteriores espero que entiendan mi opinion xddd un poco larga este juego bastante bien porque tiene muchas cosas que hacer es un minecraft en pero con mucha variedad de enemigos minerales armas puedes jugar con cualquier ordenador por sus lo malo es que te explica nada sobre el juego tienes que aprenderlo tu solo algunas veces te sientes perdido con tantos objetos

gotta start really worth purchase game getting chased aliens zombies pirates running unicorn machine gun made would play againhowever need friends adventure quite lonely boring without friends friends game makes game finest every bad game design decision think one game every months come back game remind exploration game dig tunnel hell every months come back game friends play new characters couple weeks get best gear kill bosses goes back shelf im upset ive logged around hours time review im sure two three months ill started another character every single change addition implemented final update serves make game less enjoyable lets start entirely worthless master mode change made expert mode stats enemies bosses even inflated developers made effort make even single encounter legitimately difficult opting instead increase damage dealt everything point single dart trap instantly kill enemies dealt whichever pathetic manner think since fighting head get killed real difficulty enemies addition massively inflated health pools damage absurdly high knockback resistance comes bosses expert mode implemented new ai patterns make battles challenging master mode increase already inflated stat pool even gives tangible reward subjecting battles prior higher damage leads directly next point reward never actually incentivised play difficulty additional drops boss added pool trophies pets occasional mount addition enemy drop rates identical expert mode equivalents meaning farming essential items like rod discord painful expert mode perhaps even painful due inflated stats every single enemy game thing could called incentive single additional accessory slot necessity almost every boss tedious excuse difficulty even expert mode added accessory slot implemented addition adding exclusive useful drop every single boss gamejourney mode useless entirety likely reason added many features noticed many people using similar features exploits vanilla modded playthroughs removal several duplication exploits would obviously annoy countless players lets placate watered version exploits locked behind character type gives reason actually play game save individual player defined constraints using godmode dangle front facethe additional npcs serve less purpose golf perhaps single boring sport could ever decided implement bloated abomination used call game existance furry npc degenerate admission developers degenerate scummany additions game seem serve real gameplay purpose exist like addition luck completely hidden stat raised lowered arbitrary means npc happiness serves punish player dont house npcs way developers want tothe one saving grace mods brought public eye tmodloader officially distributed steam small consolation though given anyone functioning brain cells rub together could install tmodloader ease past choosehad developers taken route many popular content mods actually added form real challenge master mode outside mere stat boosts incentive play master mode outside cosmetic garbage single accessory slot maybe would accept content level effort put stands almost additions made terraria either tedious arbitrary simply unenjoyable every single time traveling merchant came villagenpc homes would drown put water used kill pit cover pit dirt place tombstone top dirt carving name unfortunate traveler decided stop specific village onto would drown everyone every six months find getting tired game every time terraria draws back another hours bliss extraordinary game one final update way free wont regret jumping

game killing wall flesh items dropped stone box problem hardmode starts got killed ultra strong skeleton caverns many extreme mobs defeat think killing wall flesh nothing making game harder love game however rather large problemthe obvious enemy design particularly hardmode enemies simple patterns slimes jump zombies walk towards etc etc however enemies move walls wouldnt problem also nasty tendency come underneath floors cant attack problem especially hardmode enemies quite bit damage making deaths enemies feel somewhat cheap bosses problem occasionally hangaing underground cant attackedbut combat general fun quite satisfying movement responsive game isnt hard normalin words play pretty good bucks love game hours record atmbut much play time got bored trouble playing game maybe multiplayer would funi played game hallow mode never able beat first boss yeah wasnt good also stopped playing whileproseverythinnnnggconsafter hours may get boringcaused less life love game damn epic love game really gets small penis pumping blood fight boss ejaculate spurts desk kill moonlord love game little boring start momentum starts building enter hard mode game amazing may frustrating glitches definitely worth buy love game however find original grind making sure character die existing surface annoying hard time really getting mid end game stuff want start scratch id say intend one world use different class playthroughs whatnot love game theres many content pretty good replayability bosses npcs building start well first npcs would expect stores personalities npc specific way must unlock killing boss getting far game even finding spelunking even unlock gentlepeople must viable room one wouldnt want poor innocent souls lounging around outside would build house several sepperate houses make whatever want like huge glowing mushroom secret base mountain limit imagination favorite thing creating minecart tracks travel quickly different parts map ive built different things like example boss fighting arena probably invest time building helps bosses think bosses rather enemies balanced first time encounter enemies youll hard time fighting even zombies floating eyes late game youll cutting fun go hard mode really start enjoying game thing bad untill kill wall flesh new enemies ways dont worry get better weapons whether killing bosses creating youll start adapt alot weapons magic thought id put therefor exploration pretty good floating islands secret underground jungle temples fair share things kill killing alot moment get first several types wings funnest thing ever think overall amazing game completely worth ask mostly get friends like said earlier great replay value see stupid challenges speedrunning bosses overall fish lava sayin love game game make frown turn upside game gory aspects kill enemy thats game detailed diverse run low end computer console love game think defeated wall flesh nope go hardmode collect ores fight weirder monsters go expert mode get better loot etc anyways non stopping tons hours hours dont even everything ive defeated moon lord havent farmed weapons yet eventually farming get bored start wont old

would suggest playing friends also enjoyable alone mods add much replayablity would suggest friends play withthis game playde alongside friends time lifebut alone bit boring bad bit boringalso tip new player exminecraft player playing mediumcore maybe since good game make silly mistakes die suck fall damage etc experience dar playing normally dying dying multiple times try recover inventory would underestimate game called anything masterpiecethe replayability really makes game amazing classes fact every class many different weapons accessories armorsets makes much fun top game doesnt limit

aber das ist ja eher objektiv den kurzen spielspass nur zuempfehlen nurse joy cheap quick high quality suck jobs recommend nuthin wrong jogo muito interessante tenho um pouco mais de horas jogadas zerei jogo de inumeras maneiras mas sempre bacana jogar com os amigoso jogo uma mecanica e jogabilidade interessante em sua trouxe alguns problemas com lag principalmente para computadores mais fracos tem seus momentos mas chatos como na parte de e farm que maioria pessoal se rende e fica meio entendiado nos modos mais faceis tem uma consideravel tempo de farm pois os boss precisam de tanto recurso para serem vencidos nos modos mais dificeis ter set completo e muito bem montado faz muita suas batalhas interessantes uma significativa de eventos e um um tanto quanto dificil te uma boa passar algumas horas minerando pescandosim ajuda muito pescar e farmando os monstros e depois derrotar um boss bem mais jogo tem seu esquema deupgrade pode juntar itens para fazer itens melhores pode combinar armaduras e armas para deixar seu personagem ainda mais forte e geral um jogo muito interessante e que com certeza vai te trazer muitas horas de felicidade e raiva primeiro jogo que fez

time favorite games hardly wait see relogic next disclaimerthis mainly huge overreaction honestly upset longer able local coop friends siblings etc update console relogic please beg please change great one issue update xbox one wasted update game entire universe matter might ask well originally could play local multiplayer siblings single player would play time update go online play local multiplayer cant parents dont want us online dont mind end update xbox one complete waste time money hype etc completely changed thoughts terraria stars starsaka stars seriously relogic earth thinking disliked video games one update extremelly let repeat extremely hyped im probably gonna disregard tell everyone shouldnt buy absolute waste money unless play multiplayer go online plenty cash burn throw away flush etc since cant play actually pretty good game siblings relogic reading please please please change back way allow us xbox one players dont gold play local multiplayer able play siblings friends whoever without needing pay money go online ps likely overreaction really didnt expect able play siblings hard feelings agitated able play great game siblings suddenly without warning sorry anyone may angered annoyed etc catastrophic mixture pew pew boom boom lo recomiendo claro que lo recomiendo el juego es como minecraft pero creo que es un poco mejor que este ya que te vas perder solo por que la vegetacion te impide ya que es en pesar de que lo estoy jugando poco por skyrim vale la pena comprarlo se necesita escribir esto todos sabemos ya que terraria es de los mejores juegos que hay todos comprenden el por pero pueden saber que es se le termina echando un par de horitas im finished game times im bored fish able walk pretty nice look like boring platform element game patch feature gameplay fucked pixeleted cubical structures fucked back good highs quality top tier heroine trip recommend terraria minecraft wrong friend said dont remember ender dragon dropping portal gun minecraft dig deep terraria dig even deeper giant worm doesnt appear nowhere swallow entire person whole make portal hell dig hell tired using sword bow pick fallen stars increase mana unleash magical armagedden enemies ever get lonely far mines find buy pet equip summoners staff create friend thin air believe magic buy terraria completely unprepared thr journey ahead prepare ultimately confused however trips guide couple youtube tutorials later may strong enough kill god maybe blue haired reindeer antlers equipped warrior killed pink star sword rode giant blue slime
