enemies bosses appreciate addition trinkets new itemsthere several drawbacks expansion mostly glitches introduces enemies glitching corners properly working brimstone controls etc new game elements easily forget thisps gorgeous soundtrack dont know de horas al fin completado al binding isaac la expansion wrath lamb los logrosla cantidad de horas que puedes echarle hasta que tienes nada mas que hacer es simplemente increible dado el precio por el que puedes comprar el pack con el juego la expansion rebajadosi nunca jugado al juego puedes esperar acabarlo completamente en mas de horas dependiendo de tu habilidad en este tipo de juegoa los nuevos jugadores probablemente les resulte dificil mas aun con el contenido de la expansion asi que recomendaria jugar sin ella instalada en la dlc de las propiedades del juego al menos hasta que hayas desbloqueado lives superado sheol una vez despues de eso estaras preparado para los nuevos enemigos jefes apreciaras mas los nuevos objetos los trinketsla expansion tiene algunos inconvenientes como glitches que introduce del tipo enemigos que traspasan algunas esquinas los controles del objeto brimstone funcionan muy bien etc pero con la cantidad de nuevos elementos en el juego uno se puede olvidar perfectamente de estopd si todavia lo sabes la banda sonora es impresionante enjoy rougelike games want something spend minutes time
