category im even roguelikes game hit different amazing story keeps unfolding every time die combat feels tight sound visuals amazing hades pretty much ruined every game play ive played primarily switch purchasing steam im going lie say anything dislike nitpick best yeah good game im roguelikes played dead cells noita cause theyre fun figured ok roguelike seem enjoyable pick hades whimive playing game almost every night time ofc tell fell asleep lava game put bed tired slowly drifting offanyway woke sounds ass fire could save died start whole show beginning againimmediately following resurrection greeted god sleep made joke falling asleep lavaim something run ive managed beat game onceif want info gameplay read reviews im gonna say move cocaine theres new crack town im normally roguelike kinda guy hades hit little addiction centre spot onmostly characters like zag going interactions characters game progresses death death really rewarding im one leave detailed reviewsbutim going eithergood game though im proud much time spent playing first week installing game scratched itch way many games smooth tactical challenging mostly combat enough story keep interested say endgame content get little bit stale learn enemyboss mechanics strong build paths gets much easier said still keep getting pulled back cause core gameplay damn satisfying im quite sure game cant stop running time time maybe variety options kit maybe grindy nature achievements either way ive logged short runs game ive enjoyed least past ill admit bit frustrating start find runs end becomes bit rage game fail finally break really easy enjoy since know limits run work towards consistency overall solid reason didnt go requirements achievements rely lot good rng mindless grinding get text one character gets frustrating fast going runs one reason getting besides game incredible im really roguelikeslites cant stop playing hades im really rogue likes game manages fix biggest problem genre idea losing progress run im sure ever game wanted like hades beautifully presented gorgeous handdrawn artwork excellent score remarkably wellwritten managing successfully tell meaningful story genre typically focused gameplay unfortunately sad truth hours play time ive found supergiants foray action roguelike genre deeply profoundly unlikable collection bad ideas masked lovely veneerthe egregious offender progression system difficulty selection customizable letting pick list modifiers enemy health challenging bosses etc run way continue story advance quests upgrade weapons collect bounties bosses ever increasing number modifiers turned however best way upgrade character repeatedly beating bosses difficulty earning extra bounties strangely enough beating bosses significantly higher difficulty result extra rewards means optimal way play slowly increasing number difficulty modifiers laboriously farming bounties need progress game occasionally going back base difficulty want upgrade character grind wasnt tedious enough also need specific npc dialogue progress story took around escape attempts fresh save file somewhere hours play time get epilogue remarkable dedicated iintentionally suicidingi run getting certain character say right thingmaybe id less critical sheer grind hades puts core gameplay good enough support sadly anything combat mechanics deeply fundamentally flawed large number enemies later levels practically bosses soak prodigious amount damage time partially totally immune stuns debuffs makes combat feel less like hackandslash like dashandmash developing repetitive stress injury dodging countering attacks dozens times row idea challenge game seems unable provide anything else game require quite lot fast precise changes position hades controls extremely poorly using controller makes difficult target enemies whether terrible aim assist option turned lack diagonals mouseandkeyboard configuration makes hard move direction wanti already noted hades pretty obvious developers took lot time give weapon aspect attack upgrade unique appearance perhaps done slightly worse job visual clutter resulting multiple upgrade effects activating time frequently make impossible see happening onscreen becomes even frustrating get area enemies attacks similar color add poorlytelegraphed projectiles shooting offscreen isometric perspective makes harder hide behind things tiny enemies fast erratic movement result frustrating experience pits player legions hell art direction really wish could recommend hades misadventures prince zagreus world snarky gods noble heroes various mythological weirdos wonderfully entertaining even theyre drip fed course several dozen samey button mashy hours maybe monotonous grind game forces onto player carries thematic overtones characters trapped inescapable cycle death resurrection yadda yadda etc etc interest speculating whether bad legitimate narrative choice unhappy coincidence make mistake however hades bad cant recommend perhaps one day supergiant make game plays good looks doesnt seem like step right direction im trapped youre trapped im ready suffer im ready

still production ive beaten still cant stop coming back fast paced fun one favs cant wait next update ive thinking getting game glad finally didbtw im hours still havnt beat final boss game difficult rightupdate im disappointed nerfedruined chaos shield je suis proche de la centaine dheures de jeu alors je crois que cest le bon moment de faire critique tout dabord je dois dire que ce jeu nourri fascination pour la mythologie et les bonnes histoires pour un roguelite lhistoire est bien et surtout ceci dit jai la principale environ heures de jeu et jai atteint la fin de la secondaire heures de jeu maintenant que cest fait je ne pourrais dire pour combien de temps le jeu va retenir mon attention il manque quelques et jy reviendrai probablement seulement pour quelques heures par semaine le jeu est bien entendu par contre il assez pour rendre la chose et aucune de mes pour de lenfer ne paru semblable une autrepour finir je recommande fortement ce jeu quiconque aime les jeux du genre il usera fortement les boutons de votre manette mais en vaut la peine jogo excelente mesmo quem curte muito roguelike provavelmente vai curtir pois jogo tem e utiliza seu como uma forma muito bacana de narrativa disso jogo possui uma identidade visual e sonora destaque pra dubagem que expetacular e traz muita vida e para os personagens considerando que maiora dos personagen aparecem apenas como imagens ao gameplay ele muito bom controles e responsivos muito gostoso de jogar e cada arma possui sua particularidade os pactos permitem uns builds bastante interessantes e que muitas vezes instigam que eles aparecem cada run continuarei jogando por mais um tempo geralmente ligo para platinar jogos principalmente pc mas esse jogo tentarei fazer tudo jogo excepcional finalmente um jogo da supergiant games que realmente agradou fim e mais endgame um roguelike viciante mais que deadcells muito bem polido e com um endgame incentivador e divertido e principal diferente de deadcells e da maioria dos roguelikes hades ainda tem uma bela entremeada com dezenas de tentativas de sair underworld recomendo jogabilidade jogabilidade em com e combate um total de armas principais com estilos de jogo diferentes entrarei em detalhes mas da bloodstone em um dos de ataque uma camada especial este jogo roguelike com em riqueza de detalhes e polimento jogando com zagreus filho de hades vc conta com apoio de personagens e deuses cada um com sua personalidade zagreus um personagem muito bem escrito e impressionante quantidade de linhas de feitas para este jogo reagindo cada tipo de escolha e acontecimentos em cada gameplay se desenvolve em paralelo tentativas de fuga underworld pra mim um dos pontos altos jogo dificuldade progressiva e justa jogo nunca parece injusto e vc sempre evoluindo seu personagem mesmo com rng de um roguelike hades nunca parece injusto com probabilidades diferente de deadcells que liberar diversas blueprints na verdade prejudica sua probabilidade de sucesso replayability mesmo zerar jogo seu endgame viciante diferente de deadcells que realmente tem empolga coletar itens em algumas runs pra fazer boss secreto zerei com umas horas mas continuo jogando para saber mais detalhes da novos upgrades e bossescontras certas de skills principalmente das relacionadas bloodstones e upgrades martelo precisavam de um mini explicativo para te auxiliar na escolha dos upgrades quando os deuses aparecem os itens raros que dropam de bosses titan blood diamond e ambrosia deveriam ter sua utilidade explicada pois um jogador pode com coisas por exemplo titan blood fundamental pros upgrades das armas algo que jogo e ele fica horas e horas seu precisa liberar armas pra poder fazer os upgrades e descobri isso sozinho alguns deuses tem um skillset bem de outros deuses algumas currencies tem drops bem baixos visto sua e quantidade como um jogo acho q empresa dar uma calibrada nas currencies nos patches jugabilidad versatilidad rejugabilidad dificultad manejo
