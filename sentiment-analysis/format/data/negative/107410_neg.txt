paciencia con ellos muy poca optimizacion del motor grafico lo cual hace que tenga un mal rendimiento en los fps incluso con equipos bastante buenos tengo una rtx un si corre fps es un milagro etcpero por otro lado es un juego lleno de posibilidades con una amplia coleccion de mods un editor dentro del juego con el que hacer incontales misiones de lo que uno quiera warhammer star wars vietnam un largo etc solo por eso recomendaria este juego aun sabiendo que es para todo el mundo eso si es necesario buscar otras personas para poder sacarle el maximo provecho todo lo que ofrece arma graphic

basic infantry tactics learned basic sniper tactics tested weapons different calibersat weapons bots watched video guides youtube anything could find help along way certainly feeling killing players boat without use vehicles managing slip away absolutely rewarding even rewarding work team cooperative people simply fun go gun store decent wasteland server shoot campers get kills one grenade king

review game five years old yet still hideously annoying setup basic coop game friends really basic stuff cannot reccomend game enough many gamemodes ways play arma much milsim game pour hours intoi would reccomend people fence buy wont regret cannot recommend game arma still alive wellfirst game lacking content example weapons vehicles exact different nations different paint schemes map huge great till look closer buildings empty furniture nothing lot assets missing even basic objectsbuildings missions around since ofp days like cti arent therethe gun handling feels like something straight battlefield know control recoil way hard basically goes straight completely accurate fully automatic weaponthe character handling feels awkward coming someone hours arma know awkward controls like movement speeds take around keystrokes get inout happened good old days pressing w going isnt damn car dont switch gears depending speed going atspeaking cars cars handle awkwardly aswell acceleration ridiculous takes forever get around switches afterburner goes hey look afterburner oh wait trainer jet stealth freak thingy oh boy much wrong planes helicopters game love aviation hell im trying make job part hurts begin thislets start easiest trainer supposed carry weapons youre gonna tell gonna go battle air support ha good jokeim gonna honest like looks looking thing never going happen much less years still well get upgraded next years would probably systems avionics either build entirely new aircraft scratch replace already existing ground poundersoh boy comes big one damn stealth freak much wrong even funny alright lets start stealthing aircraft sharp edges bounce radar different direction coming whole aircraft needs sharp guys enginesnotice something stealth aircraft flying around today internal stores dont want suckers reflecting radar signals youthe subsonic cas close air support ground pounder literally designed fuck enemy theyll know hit wont matter cause theyll either dead equipment fucked shoot back use stealthing plane flying everyone mother seeing bad boyits also supposed take damage whole titanium bathtub shit whatnot sharpening edges adding structural failure points event know missile hitting itim aircraft engineer makes sense someone reading actually aircraft engineer please tell wrong right amsame goes stealthing helicopters mean come going stealth fucking rotor spinning hundreds rpm constantly changing pitchanglethe things work cant take choppers merge together add stealth bullshit expect anyone take seriouslyarma set near future around years look military history century progress peak vietnam kind slowed till mid less standstill still using tanks aircraft weapons designed perfectioned takes world war major conflict sort get us asses put thinking caps really think years aks etc service replaced new standard caseless shells wont still using abrams strikers bmp well probably unfortunatly probably pak fa others stuff likely old shit fancy new systemsi half blame dayz game turned dayz iswas good modgame attracted wrong kind people arma didnt attract milsim people attracted general public likes shooters zombies funny thing dayz servers find arma stupid vehicles ones military weapons every corner everyone shooting everyone else chernogorsk thats survival thats glorified deathmatch either way digress bohemia probably decided make game accessible people leading casualized shadow greati could let whole doesnt seem finished part slide werent releasing dlc parts arent finished expecting pay bucks helicopters barely base game begin withand agree future bs thing ive saying fixed mods modded servers popular modding general public wants grab one one mods like dayztldr casual version arma designed cater general public want military simulator id recommend arma feel like arma overwhelming probably game cant even get servers sometimes says session lost times says kicked game committed war crime could learned instrument get good grasp another language decided dump fat amount time killing people take ao could spend hours game still would terrible couldve sworn got thing searching beginning oh well therell always time doubt couldnt get clunky game badly ran couldnt pick weapon dead enemy dlc order use crash carfriend stops gokart next mepolice arrivesi tell friend stole carpointed carhe checks outi steal gokarti drive fast possiblei crash crashed helicopter made grown man cry died lost cried finished campaign cry everytime decided review game enough time multiplayer singleplayer feel confident personal opinion arma fourth arma game played third favourite may seem like bad opinion considering quality previous games series actually isnt performance playing incredibly poor machine gpu cpu stranger low framerates freezing said arma incredible range optimization many reviewers complain getting ultra setting playing server players fighting ai games larger map altis even machine get largescale battles maps large multiplayer servers considering game wellcontent content arma game little light landvehicle department first arma game get frequent updates constanly improving adding contentoverall view arma least complete arma game thus far updates excuse considering pricepointoverall would recommend game fan military games watch reviews gameplay first quite expensive decided play altis lifei ran buy cari drove pick applesi drove another sell applesi got fined police looking suspicousagain ran buy cari drove pick applesi drove another sell applesand someone spawned dildocopter made quad bikes killed mei rate nan rates god sake leave man fucking apples decided upgrade pc come back game year still fucking looks performs like xbox game laggy even lowest graphics

tho specially multiplayer whole screen covered overlay died jumping water foot platform died car hitting rock would go operating disappointed doctor appointment stale dark anyhow game cool gives lots uh kd points uh stuff discovered arma series arma immediatly drawn sandbox style game play got creating mods game carried arma brining mods arma new ones overall would say sadly dissapointed arma whole game brings little way content doesnt come additional cost dlcs infact large part games factions copy pasted turrets vehicles static weapons uavs game mechanics upgrade still present sometimes major problems seen arma unrefined collision detection system poor online stability syncronization game looks nice enough however much cartoony previous game gritty appearance dlcs far largest dissapointments brining little way new content often issues deal saving grace game mods available often adding things opinion missing vanilla version game end hours arma since release alpha aside initial tests campaign vanilla servers never likely never play without modifications said game worth cost free content added modding communityif liked arma understand mods want graphics upgrade means pick game like game reason cant start game problem diffrent versions problem arma website tell fix every problem exept one u good pc recomend recommendits simply badly engineered poorly optimizedkeep youre money get better money thet eg pubgcod etc regret spendign hrs game understan war played exeptional one also belive better thks dont condone use guns kill enemy commander assigned recommend saw

makes game time spent game absolute pain moment simply arent worth sufferingps im getting poor performance friend mentioned plays cpu graphics procesing gets lot better performance would recommend game crashes randomly minutes since learned known fault cannot find fix forums disappointed steam refused refund well truly ripoff would rate always die loading screen would reccomend game fun exellent level editor problem price would say game like military simulator anything else really generation one kind sort thing features realistic bullet mechanics penetration voice communication cant talk without radio example building damage enough explosives example flatten whole compound recoil bullet drop bullet mechanics essence still wanted mention onvehicles also pretty realistic ones mods dont detailed interiors vanilla theyre still pretty cool drive around also absolutely love rear view camera merkava another thing love however ton tank wont stop tracks theres tree fence front ita feature makes stand modding workshop support means people add hell lot content game like example modern weapon systems like gpmg saw even make entirely new game instance warhammer mod complete overhaul brings space marines imperial guard xenos chaos onwith said however game issues optimization bugsglitches example squad bunch run building might start bleeding torso take time grit actually get hang stop dying stupid shit ai also seems brain dead certain cases need babysitting sometimes youre making scenario ive noticedi also got nolifer buddy runs makes hardcore missions admirable perseverance almost cultlike devotion game able ignore learned adapt overcome games many small obstacles make unpleasant people truly reached form godhood amongst us plebian simple men also commendable nerves steel dealing us lesser retards mission wanna fuck around would strongly advise anyone buying game dozens reasons game many shortcomings missing features industry standard decades throughout game severe lack quality attention detail contrary game advertises realistic flexible issues range small large mods unable fix last decade arma various expansions arma continues trend take hours write every point low quality mention big offenders incomplete weapon animations single weapon sets animations done mods cannot fix present game meddling quality often hands uniforms clipping weapons sounds fully synced ai gets lost stuck runs shoots back frequently also walk many objects props map immersion breaking mission editor buries common frequently used functions graphical user interface gui often requiring memorize many complex scripts example making mission end killing certain enemies require script written games dcs janes usaf via gui poor squad ai command interface slow cumbersome inaccurate squad movement commands want accurately position team members like tactical shooters luck unrealistic weapon sway point aiming hitting someone meters front iron sights chore ai difficulty following roads even place highly detailed waypoints ai severe difficulty crossing bridges even well placed waypoints way make waypoint automatically follow road common games mission editors dcs flight simulator ai fairly inconsistent inconsistency increases larger mission almost every remedial task editor require form scripting either game via external file scripts simple assigning artillery one player may require full page paragraph script written player loadout editing fairly limiting cannot carry two rifles example common many real world snipers vehicle damage modelling sub par mostly relies hit point based system damage enemy ai often unfairly cheats player abnormally weak cant hold rifle steady enemies spin around prone position spot laying prone grass meters away get head shot within shots tweak accuracy general ranges terminator blind man ai severe difficulty navigating indoors includes frequent clipping walking walls likewise ai often gets lost cities cluttered areas player often stop walking take minute rest every minutes wait team members find poor control layout ui function open door also switches pistol ammo type number things often times may trying close door option disappear scroll menu player instead swap pistol many seemingly simple things possible exiting boat walking onto pier possible instead fall water clumsily swim around find ladder present also true ai making ai surrender mid level type mission editing require many scripts different grenade types present via mods quality effects low end dont expect flash bangs work like flash bangs placing plane runway making take requires lot effort necessary flight sims automatically clicks yet arma requires much many shortcomings come mind summarize arma limited frustrating mods scripts occasionally offer patch jobs shortcomings fix experience game lacks detailed micro management found games swat older rainbow titles also lacks attention detail flight sim genre made common simulators many instances movement weapon handling mainstream games battlefield top arma arma could much better ultimately falls flat anyone values quality realism inconsistency immersion breaking actions awkward workarounds ai limitations prevent anything basic missions playing convincingly eventually placing bunch units little walk shoot get old disappointed limitations holding back mission designs would recommend arma arma apex piece meal dlcs would suggest game werent abhorrent dlc practices going bohemian wont stop releasing dlc manages make game unplayable dont

shiznik one said fight war pants one said fight war pants one says fight war pants one says fight war pants recomiendo este juego por las siguientes razones pobre del engine casi todas las partidas que jugado en las corro con alrededor de fps cuando la la puedo jugar entre fps malos servidores pareciera que cada servidor tiene como mods por lo que debes realizar una descarga cada vez que quieres iniciar en diferentes servidores pesar de que tengas buena se si es la cantidad de jugadores lo sobrecargado que el mapa es casi imposible disfrutar del juego ninguna de las armas poseen los nombres originales por lo que entiendo el costo del juego es posible que este juego cueste alrededor de euros cuando casi todo el armamento equipo utilizado en el juego es ficticio por lo que los desarrolladores tuvieron que pagar por ninguna clase de derechos de autoreste juego lo yo sino que fue un regalo de mi primo por lo que le agradezco absolumente por el gesto sin embargo ambos sabiamos que este titulo iba ser tan defectuoso run gun game screaming kids servers allow smooth joining need pay ridiculous amount dlcs servers modded mod anywhere game sucks way better call duty feel cheated

demands lot cpu believe poorly optimised lot units moving framerates stay smooth soon people start shooting performance plummets believe something badly optimised effects demanding ai pretty poor case multiplayer performance even worse considered normal effectively unplayable people accept due game restrictions devs ought really address gameplay terrible bad feels like buggy rather poor design decisions jogging seconds cause start panting creates extreme weapon sway maybe trying simulate walle future fat soldiers really kills gameplay considering size arma missions require lot moving recoil weapons ridiculous feels like guy shooting one hand gun held sideways damage ridiculous enemy targets take headshots chest shots brought adds together completely kill immersion makes game feel like chore immersion keeping mind bad shooting mechanisms ai utterly gamebreaking well empty clip bullets relatively small meter area around enemy target budge flinch keep shooting die probably die awful recoil system place makes aiming player impossible ai basically terminators simply run time time stand still shoot death mod reduces recoil mod player mow ai like fish barrel simply dont move theyve decided stop shoot content really really lacking okay single player campaign pretty dull whats really bad seem left lot content community develop ambient combat module editor unlike arma specops
