save money maybe theyll learn hours game good far bugs glitches type wont go away use different game engine done good job turning game around since launch playable able pick deluxe edition worth generally glass halffull gamer really given reviews others felt generous good technical game heavily marred game crashing bugs make unplayable wish otherwise like simulation system roster gameplay modes available new matches stalling load screen let alone abysmal frame rate action bumps four characters screen match season starts lighting far bright cut scenes makes everything screen faded option reduce even selecting mode menu cause crash times sole positive saves progress screens little silver lining frequently playthrough need restart game see intro screens progress dice roll want

share glitches seen people walk tables mesh glitches one pairs heels female superstars well number minor game breaking glitches hair physics great textures awful dont necessarily look realistic animations talking awful dont sync give game early definitely crashes game confirm spec related amd ryzen processor mainly experienced crashes create superstar move set entrance appearance also experienced frustratingly completing difficult match resulting loss progress final negative saw game spoiler black text spoiler male character particular always seems losing career mode way many cutscene losses couldve easily match forced lose progress story also feels like questions gave direction storyline pretty much useless little weight happens never felt like directing story career always felt characters dealt worst hand times finally win end doesnt feel rewarding enough crap brooklyn von braun puts early retirement kind ruins story wished whole time wouldve gotten choice tell tre reds secret start wish final match career mode would get contracts back able set matches within mode beat main story finally contrary popular opinion miss old style career mode didnt make male female superstar wish given us choice instead even alter storyline story wasnt great anyway keep attention end hoping would worth annoyances along way wasnt spoilerall aside game loaded content would still recommend really fun totally worth sale price talking animations might suck wrestling move animations amazing havent played wwe game since wwe greatly improved since talking animations aside found edge seat career storyline even though disappointed eager see happened hoping would get better put hours game ive barely grazed content within bought game back christmas fact id heard improving
