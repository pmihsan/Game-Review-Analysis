delux edition blast thus far brawl arenas dlc fun play buy comes sale finally took plunge glad like like slightly slower paced think game fix right check specs req want play smoothly great wrestling game far took blind shot reading negative reviews regarding instability game crashed time starting story modei saw graphics awesome resolution textures physics really add feeling game movements really smooth camera play really gives sensation real matchreally fun game far tried nominate game award realised award biggest absolute mess year shame big roster wasted use simulate matches like versions follows tradition getting worse heres ever growing list issues try anymore creations match solid chance crashing crashes editing characters teams regular crashes rumbles frequently horrible glitches normal encounter one character mask always stuck like ship anchor middle ring anothers hair floats head still despite devs saying fixed ages ago refuses save champions title changes hands match go manually every single time change custom belts still glitching characters sometimes freeze place thus dooming match never end crowd sound still completely buggeddone terribly previous years much crowd tracks play random times heel move boo second later face one track resets cheers hell anything singles matches pick arena except mania crowd unbearable added tracks get bigger arenas anything mania means noticeable track changes creepy van entrance goes right arena stages announcer gets stuck loop time prominent run high school gym cant turn tap mini game cases love god still cant backstage pinfalls submissions always end random ko falls count anywhere matches cant set backstage brawl actual match instead overall pathetic disservice fans wwe games make pay much copy paste job last year cant even get game work properly already trying sell dlc release dlc fixes game point wwe needs something nightmare product wanted big sweaty men grappling sim got horror game body horror foul would petrify junji ito wanted like game honest game started fine glitches virtually crashes use game almost exclusively universe mode recently though begun become unplayablemy dadwho caretaker enjoyed setting shows payperviews universe would set let computer thing however bugs code made impossible play crashes upon creation title match disappointed becky lynch battle royal become number contender crashes match anyway would never save thing also freezes going various modes within game like others think add old aspects previous games would say would influence decision game everything worked way would great game fix would stay away feel ripped given amount paid could gotten refund game would hesitant buy game going lie reading reviews say though havent experienced crashes minor glitches every thats really clue many people experiencing ton crashes bugs glitches like havent really experienced allmaybe depends type computer parts etc dont really know understand experience though would recommend game especially sales got deluxe edition like bucks usually around sawhaving mixed gender tag matches back amazing one reasons decided buy got sale along womens tag belts womens evolution showcase morethe thing wish different would looks superstars dont look horrible would say look good even better quality peopleupdatestill experienced crashes game works matches involving people glitches thats naturally given games nothing would annoy much none matches glitched cant progress match forthpeople might experiencing things im thankfully game runs like since moment bought skeptical game since nearly reviews negative im hours mycareer mode story actually pretty decent glitches nearly many expected gameplay mechanics arent good svr era wwe games still pretty fun id give would higher sound graphics werent grab sale less id say well worth youre big wwe fan wondering bought game far problems least nothing affects gameplay really recommend sale would deffenetly play game worth every penney would like come somewhat defence game played hours game one crash understand accept people experienced one crash rightly upset however inspite enjoyable experience gamei would love see make greater improvements future wwe titles reducing crashes gpu dependance couple features would love see come wwe future one ability add custom entry tracks without fiddling games files second return custom finishing moves wwe raw vs smackdown problems retry game check system settings make sure everything optimal go graphic settings set high preformance perminatly run smoothly would recommend current state game frequent crashes lack content bother campaign worst voice acting ever seen single player fixed crashes bugs added things would pretty solidnot much people playing multiplayer havent much chance see people told servers goodso conclusion would recommend patches crashes fixes bugs adds content unless really care updated rosteralso tf game locked would recommend game even though ive put many hours count going continue play probably forseeable future yukes develops another wrestling game youre fan wwe games buy previous version whichever one minor mean minor improvements aspects previous games downgraded much worth buying even new moves characters customization options id fun auschwitz ill preface saying ive bought every mainstream wwe game launch since smackdown bring since ive also played games came japan releases thanks emulation rather lot game hours various wrestling gameseven game really worth feels super sluggish play numerous strange decisions made games design leave baffledthe biggest omission opinion inability press squarex select random wrestler list screen something every wrestling game ive played fire pro mercy king colloseum bring def jam vendetta way back wwe game far worse predecessor roster updates youd like pretty decent replicas community creations advantage buying game steam wallet ready spend deserving titles adamant buy game wait worth absolute maximum thats deluxe edition way doesnt even get every unlockable im huge fan wwe games series ive always enjoyed ones people hate game legitimately worth buyingyou read reviews see incredible amount issues present game end day game broken play core game broken genuine downgrade last years game nearly every wayunfortunately cant see game getting patches

match womens showcase mycareer dont know patch even fixed issues forgot mention gameplay speed wwe works perfectly im bit concerned gameplay speed would issue im usually huge fan wwe series im giving game thumbs hoping fix game soon possible game definitely step back terms graphics aspects look better character models dont look good last year game tends crash lot game seems rushed theres many small mistakes easily fixed im hoping update come week fix ones making game unplayable character creation female characters really disappointing male characters many items women dont reason especially face paint masks custom logos also dont work put ingame logo mycareer characters game wont even load cutscenes skippable means lose match sometimes youve rewatch minute cutscene make game slow theres many bugs stuff cant excused want game better potential developers seem like theyre passionate game wanted succeed knew game isnt good enough yet released wait hope developers fix improve game soon listen fans still bounce back put effort improving game ive bought every thq wwe game since one worst one ive played broken buggy love creating characters best part games ive followed wwe games since day reckoning look back past way better present things fine came around franchise began downward spiral things took turn worsethe first thing plague restriction genders aka male vs female expect people relive classic moments stars like chyna cant even pit past male opponents fact youd use mod tools remove restrictions second thing absence specialty matches people raising voices demanding return popular matches like inferno buried alive fulfill fantasy bra panties etc instead put matches think appropriate lot fans steaming finally overall innovative feel game long gone remember custom textures could used crowd signs various createamodes brought best developers care clothing put caws video games gobbledy gooker cannot genuinely made entrance restriction also point limit needs go gm mode game mode fans screaming top lungs return years end day falls nothing deaf earsin conclusion last straw gotten point voice fans longer concern wwe im done yearly cookiecutter release cycle nothing improves dont expect ever return ive lot experience wwe games ever since wwf mercy raw vs smackdown games started get progressively worse slow motion thing first issue noticed ruined experience game crashed match change settings like turning shadow lowering crowd density well turning settings run character models wrestlers laughable found creation wrestlers look miles better second ring count slow pin system awkward played tag team match found couldnt get back match unless stood right next turnbuckle match couldnt get anywhere near spend mins min match taking part work
