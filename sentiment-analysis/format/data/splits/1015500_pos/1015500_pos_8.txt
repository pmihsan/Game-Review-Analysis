crashes tengo todos los juegos de la franquicia para pc desde el sin duda alguna este es el peor las son malas la jugabilidad es un desastre tengo registradas pocas horas ya que despues de una dos luchas independientemente del modo de juego se traba se crashea se queda en la pantalla de carga te deja otra que desisnstalarlo como dije soy fan de esta serie de juegos el wwe es una enorme les recomiendo jugar cualquier otro juego de esta franquicia por mucho es mejor que este saludos terrible game wanted like figured id give shot pc waste thank god constantly crashes cant play online universe mode play mode anything played single match every time attempt game crashes sends back desktop disappointed also seems online mostly dead didnt see one match trying play online mode ability import faces images broken makes game pretty much unplayable recommended play wwf attitude owen hart edition best part game waiting unskippable cutscenes game occur places may end replay simple idea none oncreen controls even remotely match game wanting pins almost impossible get onscreen prompts occur sync visuals meant use get could teach cat play arma faster could sit steven hawking figure anything onscreen game means must mention twice way long gaming history fall victim unskippable cutscenes would get throw garbage go play mortal kombat street fighter literally wwe game btw indie game probably better sort thing search wwe wrestling steam best feature ability make memes ai fighting got humblebundle least went charity one good thing game best story wwe gamesi like much first thing must point resolutions slow advanced technology chance get running close intended green marker nvidia technology geforce experience becomes friend case knocked resolution running smoothlyas reported bugs present day one yet seen slowly time game made stable enough played least confirmed cancelled game probably get legacy support compared originals content worth buying given fresh feel gamemy graphics laptop build varient ram game crashed within first minutes playing additionally crashed times within first minutes playing say graphics lot better reviews made think theyd crashes im fixing ask refund game crashes every time try play get work using old drivers video card still full glitches example myplayer hair render properly looks terrible glowing circles game would fun filled bugs game feels like setback compared frame rate highlight reel drops recent dlc bump night second match showcase dip noticable lag trying kick pin match overall keep playing game like step back compared last years game also optimised worse last years game habit buying games wait go sale buy fire pro wrestling world instead game patched ton nearly broken used however game still locks loading screens hour gameplay results need log windows game locks top task manager game beautiful amazing obviously doesnt work often fine soon lock pc said may destroy also controls changeable fine using different controls like reversal button x finisher may like play game way better game fun works buggy physics ugly character models tendency crash fairly often mar would otherwise really fun wrestling game unique story mode lots fun customizable match types slew fun features quirks would recommend people really look past myriad issues get dirt cheap like game broken matt hardy hes shamefully broken game even month release game still crashing im editing move set mitb completely broken showcase poorly designed act god helped finish frame rate drops certain arenas multi man matches run gtx result could worse career good lols thats positive find game worth storymode story couple dreamed wwe stars thats story cant costumize characters choose eyecolor hairstyle colour preset face look like aliens sims controlls really shitty game buggy hell want fun wwe game get version game worth money game perfectly fine internal bugs glitches runs smooth perform well first hours gameplay start playing pc mainly playin console version game poorly optimized could totally better like hair animations etc better hours gaming faced crashes fun play actually myplayer kinda boring cause cut scenes story bad also characters manage exhausting well game modes im much fun playing want buy game full price dont buy instead game pretty fun got sale definitely worth original price seems like negative reviews come people experience game crashesi got game mainly custom character creation downloads love creating custom matches watch characters downloaded created go ring fight one another pure entertainment hilarious game running fine although dont see blood even though option enabled browsing custom created characters slow wish game faster paced arcady still pretty fun especially playing locally friendsluckily havent plagued crashing issues like others game simply broken seemed trending positive direction thats even case cant load save data correctly without game breaking sort fashion matches end middle match declaring opponent victor without type fall happening game game sucks game good love game much bugs game minus glitches good animations game good moves however lot pretty bad look think games need animation reworks many choppy animations look bad roster huge new arenas nice like crazy stuff problem game however glitches bugs sounds missing matches glitch almost every match attire clipping errors worst constant crashes enjoy game crashes occur would recommend game wait next game made go enjoy runs far better game looks great besides awful hair physics game play controls pretty great actually play game game crashes game ever played painfully annoying would recommend game crashing fixed knowing never unless die hard wrestling game fan stand constant crashes buy glitches make game better good news fun worksthe bad news rarely works serious issues especially glitches crashesthe game crashed times hours long streamelimination chamber winning scene also removedyou people really fix game fun game making friends game watch cpu fight streaming matches discord however fact game absolutely ridiculous game riddled glitches prevent creating want crashes random intervals seemingly reason seems completely ignore support requests although lot fun game friends watching ai fights longer defend game banned allegedly violating online tos even though everything uploaded compliant online tos yet receive reason communication developers bugs ive encountered matches failing load character arena selection happens time rope physics issues overall game impresses im amazed well animations man royal rumble find fun select certain matchups sit back watch feels even better watching real thing reason played came humble bundle charity loved hate new game take wonderful metaphor wwe product going downhill steady pace time professional wrestlers loved seeing face video game see character models wonder really way got stop crashing roll back drivers otherwise crashes consistently within minutes great boasts large roster half face models look copypasted soulless plain inaccurate mycareer embarrassing interesting thing game dlc im actually begging give dime trainwreck dont make mistake play instead removal feature could adjust placement created wrestler face elements align face texture basically rendered game unsalvageable creators like major creators platforms basically announced creating anything game result true hadnt played game long would return playing games buying maximum package available releasepreorder day since bring congratulations ensured new customer aew game dropsedit last update game added feature back game still cant recommend game marred crashes bizarre circumstances unpredictable example character assign particular wrestlers entrance music game instantly vanishes screen unfortunate gameplay great game far many quirks instabilities recommend story mode pretty fun play havent stopped playing two days four key issues game lead recommend performance even months patches performance game pc subpar matches feel choppy sluggish pacing first two matches unplayable due incredibly slow performance drastically reduce graphics settings get decent performance matches rig consists gtx ryzen processor rig capable running game leads believe game poorly controller restrictions game shipped ability change controls keyboard users much appreciated options people using controller people purchase game going use controller games like built controllers mind begs question controller users limited one control scheme option remap controls use alternative control scheme providing key settings limits user default control controller scheme new edition franchise developers decided drastically change control scheme controller users unnecessary change made playing game xbox controller objectively worse key controls reversals signatures finishers paybacks dragging opponents changed button combinations make playing game incredibly cumbersome example perform finisher press press x making simple process previous game slightly difficult new game character models character models seem incredibly rushed models superstars like roman reigns feel polished models superstars seem lack quality control example playing match elias entrance playing witness one wonky set facial animations eyes elias looked demented deranged teeth unnaturally white taunt audio certain superstars sync superstar animationsconclusion game still long way away polished well performing game recommend anyone purchasing even low sale prices id recommend skipping instalment waiting next years absolute fucking game ive ever played woulda thought smackdown vs raw would better graphics game comes buy game save money buy something else lmao want hours back game much bugs selled update game way playable hope updatesedit playing time update say playable yes game plenty bugs left need fixed playable whats matters right would say buy want really fun need aware game needs time hopefully bug free could good game really broken wrestlers music added like broke fully enjoy love bret hart change attire hair floats like feet head game right past games full price think know bad fucking gamewhen first saw desastrous release social media convinced enough keep playing wasnt perfect sure better mess flash forward around christmas time saw able get game bucks sale im huge universe mode fan universe approaching wrestlemania saw good opportunity switch old game spent nearly hours new one heard decent

bad luck timing id able continue show little problemsi opened task manager shut game started tried start first match hallelujah worked got enjoyable match glad everything working right tried load second match aaaaand game crashed againi shut restarted loaded second match worked decent quality anticipation suspense tried start third match well guess fucking crashed third time minutes game universe mode fucking unplayable right least dont wanna reload game every single fucking match want like really whole universe set said really think roster universe mode options even graphics superior

probably never say never ya know game came buggy mess admit theyve put work much better perfect means god damn runs better previous installments graphics taken step back ive found like roster community creations wont notice much picked sale game dlc absolutely worth purchasepersonally since dont think worth full price dlc pricing worth grabbing reduced price absolutely really fun game crashed every time finished match even sale game worth struggle even enjoy wwe positive side graphics typical series nothing great still looks good roster decent variety current stars well older stars past sadly get game refunded inability work game freezes win hour fight efforts gone vain game full pauses stops crashes esc key paused doesnt work correctly game simply full bugs recommend game could get refund would say fun work anything worth saving prob crash go black get chance save game issues including random crashing interesting bugs ropes enjoy game graphics downgrade would say better game
