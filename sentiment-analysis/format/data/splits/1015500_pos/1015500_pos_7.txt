start custom universe adding aew indie venues game save frustrating spent many hours trying set tag teams factions lose game save refunding play worth even sale review person didnt experience loading screen crashes got experience game properthis good game youve read reviews notice people frequently experience crashes gamebreaking glitches didnt encounter enough people would stay away game reason alone problems endi played wwe franchise games starting casual fan professional wrestling things like sorts games ill start positivesthe core mechanics fun require skill mastering variety body types move sets make jumping casual match feel fresh different last strongest selling point games youre playing royal rumble desperately trying avoid elimination superstars keep barrelling unashamedly tagteaming game best fun fastpaced challengingsecondly story mode surprisingly entertaining despite riddled cliche narratives subarcs expect wwe highbrow fiction main characters grew time end story really found rooting enjoying progression talethis positives end game types badits lazybad didnt encounter gamebreaking glitches certainly encountered numerous bugs people glitching objects matches ending leaving character standing empty ring button inputs registering correctly ringropes gaining sentience flying across screen like adderall cynicalbad half characters outfits locations weapons etc put behind pseudopaywall unlock ingame points earned slow rate gametime also bought ive paid game deal microtransactions considering general unfinished feel game slap face games microtransactions well ensuring addons cosmetic gamechanging cosmetic changes mostly singleplayer game players invariably favourite wrestler feels exploitative put undertaker stone cold steve austin behind pay wall especially storyline hits repeatedly beats wrestlers help inspire fans make people feel like belong well looks like belong small price coinsits unintuitivebad storyline instance game makes watch unskippable cutscenes fight bad mostly forgivable isnt forgivable replay mission lost fight feel like watch cutscene without able skip sometimes like row minutes waiting something youve already watched like game sitting telling cant play gameits game engine bad oh god amount achingly tedious loading screens pretty good pc god almost comical amount loading screens theyll stick sometimes youll ring fighting someone interrupt fight game cut loading screen load separate level fight new person triplea class game money enough shouldnt taken story minutes twiddling thumbs continuing given something like songs game play continuous loop moments genuinely felt sorry victims torture hear sit listen radiohead song repeat hoursthis game isnt even funbad every turn frustrating boring unrewarding cynical lazy please dont buy rly fun gameplay upgrade rly good game rn game glitchy really fun complete rip add patches soon strictly fans game crashes every time without fail mostly closing time limit played hours straight without superstars look like handdrawn look ok playing match better ok compared cant skip career cutscenes controls miss old stars roster available career story like fifa though mark mixed tag matches controls improved get years online play towers good next wwe releasing long time small details like chairs names customization options audience arena adjusted empty seats arena options stars customization buy deluxe dlc etctip old system low vram graphic disable graphic options postcamera cuts shakes ring side replay reduce audience arena disable shadows fxaa graphic change disable vsync graphic options steps cannot increase fpsyou able clock fps settings low budget pc shame steam granting refund shit game full bugs glitches crashes took hours get run steam wont refund id wait till drops way price even till next game waaaaaaaay better everything except story mode since bought crash gamebreaking bug guess game fine im lucky fun highly recommend didnt dislike one quite much everyone else possibly hadnt played game vein something like years fun parts story mode amusing least even means upgrade character clunky load times screens unforgivably slowso obviously cant recommend people actually pay high price play control scheme clunky heck really good reason theres lot breadth game plenty modes etc isnt much depth everything unreasonably convoluted sure way leads fun play maybe core combat fluid full weird power statuses tied count many reversals littered obnoxious mini games could overlook lack coherent way play ongoing story mode fighter gm ive playing game quite time far actually enjoying iti know lot bad reviews like really lot even checked online reviewthing far play bad reviews game experience like glitching match issues dont really experience might fixed already since played game way late othersbut far think totally worth compare freshly releasedso like wrestling guess give goi focusing myplayer mode really enjoying given top quality graphics cutscenes far goodso goodluck hope review help thinking buying far issues game looks amazing played singles match well man elimination chamber steady whole time max settings glitches anything lot better reviews would believe mind installed ssd idk makes difference far im enjoying far games controls slightly different time around reverse xb perform finishers signature moves havent come across glitches yet seems game par rest seriesnot really fan series prefer old arcade style games like hctp smackdown vs raw series liked wwe games youll enjoy oneedit put hours gameplay reversed recommendation game god awful dont waste money gameplay broken game sucks nuff said dont ever review games believe people play everyone different however worst game
