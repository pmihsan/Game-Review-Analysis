wrestling dont buybut want game good story nice roster familiar faces might consider buying wwe probably best wwe game since mycareer mode back created superstars wwe good game ok lots deliberation reading someone elses review actually good getting cheap took days decide snagged deluxe edition honestly havent much fun wrestling game prob years played little enjoyed didnt pull bought special played little loaded pleasantly surprised graphics look pretty good yeah faces leave room desired overall wrestlers look pretty good first time think ever wrestling game partly like rousey play using least playing women lot fun first thing loaded wasteland wanderers quite enjoyed something different commentators seem much better remember much repetition actually seem saying right thing right time one crash first match loaded right back except slowdown twice match crashes hours play change frames though heard may cause issues loaded really thought id one match see liked go back playing mmo rest night im stopping go sleep looking forward getting various modes tomorrow good people plenty places selling cheap fun ive wrestling game long time although havent really watched years cept wife watches divasbella twins shows faces ive seen shows lot wrestlers know almost nothing cept old schoolers really tempted load back right got cold hopefully covid need sleep ok people made even think buying game launch playable issues long keep vsynce videos showing state game anything say worth buy wwe fan alot fun ouchi giant unapologetic wwe fan watch shows religiously know scripted fights arent real dont care tv turn think top characters costumes mixed super athletic stunt work improvisation cheesy writing speaks hoping better simulation wwe roster amazing superstars missing hoping looking lio rush character models absolutely brilliant render female superstar god awful dont know make ladies faces boxy waxy itwhen comes game play moments game outright unplayable single match either ruined nearly ruined glitches incomplete sequencingi dont know happened go back way things game oh boy start wwe want long indepth review talking everything whether buy much time hands gowell lets start actually trying play game many cant dont believe actually games published poorly made unplayable due crashes unacceptable opinion makes full price game unjust fix download driver works run ran problem driver fixed honestly dont bother cos theres much trash gameexhibition standard vanilla quick play mode adds custom modes meh youre looking quick fix wrestling games match types really lackluster gaunlet match lumberjack match anything type sure gave us custom match creations create matches thats time consuming wanna jump play would liked options didnt provide content originals seriously asked get allows creativity want play game gets fundamentals right glitches mode rampant mode makes seems like getting money actually needed even really demanded community recollectioncareer get play male female superstar journey career multiple different storylines havent touched eh seeing rest game would wanna commit long term game theres better options like old gold thq svr gamesonline servers really bad often find confused friend standing still reason find friend disconnected bot boom without warning poor server quality last wwe games stop keep connected crying loudgameplay new controls make game nightmare play even controls mastered still nightmare play sluggishly slow paced gameplay get left wandering could miss faster paced games honestly seem exhilarating lackluster game compare real life wwe falls short due pacinggraphics graphics meh theyre okay face models characters unforgivable take look edge dont believe roster seems kind slim dont know brands disposal often found going people interesting match think buy legends ingame currency could mistaken hope lootboxes crying louduniverse mode get gm mode please would much rather get dedicated booking system gives things think rather empty game mode basic really leaves alot desired grand scheme things fans asking gm mode years would like fully fleshed experience set rivalries book storylines propose trades superstars brands etc guess previous wwe games offered youre missing nothing new instalment issues glitches aplenty superstars getting stuck ropes flat face disappearing entrances leaving eyes mouth showing unforgivable say never saw smackdown vs raw even previous instalments game came good like entrances though cant seen multiplayer matches removed sucks eh bobby roodes favourite crowd sound awesome implemented earlier games new exclusive feature finally actually good job keeping game uptodate attires gimmicks dont seem date bar odd one two characters pretty much music still used every superstar thing smackdown long smackdown live changed october guess look past also seth rollins isnt monday night messiahconclusion game worth money worth little fun ruined glitches boring commentary head ache inducing issue issue wanted able smooth experience playing favourite wrestlers nxt smackdown raw game released whos idea continue solely developing games really need step dont care originals want smooth experience great gm mode gripping compelling story mode tight knit controls makes gameplay fluid effortless seemless oh wait patch iso cool create championchip finally yes ok ill download
