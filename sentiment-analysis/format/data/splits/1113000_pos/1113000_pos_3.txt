murder mystery heart actual combat fun really think next move especially higher difficulties whole point need make sure enemies get chance hit exploiting weakness must especially hard mode side characters random npcs main cast everyone memorable something say talking unnamed class mates also get insight game world also little story arcs fun follow unnamed townsfolkthe social links memorable good stories fan culture club drama story line find melodramatic time quite important one terms themes main cast endlessly entertaining great english voice work chemistry incredible really helps make characters seem like people despite typical anime tropes story good wouldnt say par persona usually allot going already know sometimes fail realise super obvious stuff sake padding characters help remedy great dialogue genuinely touching funny momentsthe graphics bit original style great hd retouching character models look great games style really helps make timeless despite persona raising bar

wanted share thoughts probably contain spoilers characters first nonspoiler points hopefully persuade buy game great time itspoiler freepersona golden murder mystery jrpgvisual novel game first jrpg cant really say compares games genre played visual novels like good visual novel persona amazing lovable charactersbut game jrpg vn well put simply majority game vn style albeit greater amount interactivity roam around quiet town inaba spending time friends working jobs general goofing around second half game takes part randomly generated dungeons typical rpg style way two seemingly separate areas linked one simple mechanic backbone game possibly series social links form social links party members people around inaba including school friends work colleagues old granny hangs river social link represents different arcana type persona improving social links allows create stronger personas arcana use combat addition improving social links party members allows unlock new skills

anyone buy play fun warned youve never played persona game die point usually using stat affecting moves youre used stat affecting moves required rpgs like dont like jrpgs sure play pokemon thats played hearing good would agree games stop playing youre bored games stop playing hours since hours supposed go sleep hours ago latter absolutely hookedthe writing characters selling point likeable well written including side characters game takes self seriously takes seriously light hearted delightful terms gameplay quite simple thankfully super grindy combat go rather quickly times others difficult tactics needed boss fightsif like good writing play game dont like isnt grand revelation cup tea recommend people want easy time babys first megaten leads way getting older megaten games platforms potentially localized first time well ill buy however many persona ports fine guess like game fine alright enough part dont like social links life sim part modern persona annoying far time consuming id rather go outside rejected leisure prefer megaten games guess particularly maniax editions bloody brilliant devil summoner cheesy hell really good digital devil saga made feel terrible anyone likes sun persona mediocre nostalgically mediocre anyway port steam thanks atlus dont like color yellow dont normally review games dont really consider much gamer ive really played wow whole life triple indie release remember getting persona came really enjoying loving soundtrack started finding persona soundtrack falling love always hoping play game found came steam didnt hesitate buy iti didnt know getting didnt know characters design like knew plot game always hearing friends liked diamond unbreakable say thing im hours could subject change genuinely really love game plot game amazing balance days forming bonds studying working training watching weather etc much complex persona many ways like characters persona bit overall way people face game makes love persona finding rotten adults making confess crime see main characters face sides things dont want made public things dont agree really sticks love something youre bored around someone make feel better scared rejection questioning sexual orientation stuff stuff ive struggled time feel lot people well characters may likable persona people characters persona written better wont touch graphics since game

enjoy pc port game also comes custom difficulty option want challenge less grinding way around theres also preset difficulty options gameplay turn based first auto sets characters ai controlled switch direct commands highly suggest ai doo doo fart yeah super fun gameplay thats itthe depending play guess could call social sim game goes calendar based system certain actions take time certain actions performed certain time day sounds confusing talk social link characters better idea want day whether upgrading certain social stat deepening bonds corelate strong protagonist personas sometimes party members personas strikes perfect balance rpg daily life stuff theres always certain deadline need get dungeons done makes plan ahead lets move story cast story takes place rural town called inaba theres strange kidnappings murders taking place job save victims murdered thrown inside tv dungeons manifest go cast game far cannot stress enough outshines persona games everyone unique unique charm character development goes whole game social links arcs like persona major case moving soundtrack game phenomenal persona bit better way quality songs theyre also full length persona best music ever heard complaint overused ton short dungeons constantly loop heres talk negatives game poses get fixed updates fixed persona games dungeons pretty lame opinion randomly generated layout objective find stairs idea could enviornments floor well doesnt feel like getting sense progression time want save leave use item go back entrance annoying remember buy games optimization sometimes shotty instance attack game drops frames second picks back ive heard cutscene lags crashes occured never expirienced fixed issues open beta game steam properties theres lot misc qol changes feel like couldve implemented port doesnt effect joy game poses really conclusion game jam packed content good game couldnt tell review sure game short comings lot jrpgs fall victim everything going perfect every player game charming outshines issues half time wont even notice game classic expirienced least rpg fan around hours content freaking steal amazing game bbuy b dont really know say hasnt said alreadyi mean mainline persona going multi platform first time fact alone pretty big incentive buy itit also helps game pretty amazing even remotely like jrpgs owe least try itbut end day fricking persona fun stylish pc game loved many good reason game even remotely piqued interest chances going love itbuying might also make atlus open porting games elsewhere thats neat dont really know put enjoyed shit persona back refused buy vita golden long last return inaba enjoy delicious new social linksfor real everything opening theme first awakening really brings back good ol days want nostalgia kick want play good jrpg finished persona royal want hand crazy uncle sticks goddamn itps naoto best girl dont think could praise game enoughthe gameplay amazing game soundtracks best ever heardif thinking

port great havent problems whatsoever yet game runs really well pc dont think people understand much wish bathe sweat chie satonaka please god world live allow life time bathe within comfort chies sweat even take marie chie limits please need dont think something needs said game masterpiece classic everything story characters gameplay music memorable amazing enjoy turn based rpgs lot planning involved youll doubt fantastic experience youll still enjoy story love characters makes game worth remember play game experience dont think theres point talk point beyond totally worthwhile addition base game definitely best version game would highly recommend anyone even slightly interested buy game support atlus bringing games pcnow thats way im going discuss port thats probably informative saying persona classic every rpg fan experience performancethe port bare bones performance doesnt seem issue ive played desktop along acer notebook nvidia mobile graphics years ago got basically smooth gameplay optionsthe options menu incredibly basic almost graphical tweaking thats really problem considering year old game however annoying bugs like game sometime opening windowed mode despite options saying fullscreen full key rebinding option plus cant comment high resolution scaling since play display ive heard text scaling issues higher resolutions google buying dealbreaker youcontrolsdont play kbm unplayable odd camera controls mouse reason use controllerbugswell ive experienced hard freezes restart pc im pretty sure related controller disconnectingreconnecting loose usb cable would momentarily cause game stutter sometimes freeze entirelyanother major bug shadows dungeons unbearable youre playing uncapped fps shadows movement speed engage combat tied fps much harder get player advantage long time realized much easier fpsaside major issues game worked perfectly fine totally worth price admissionfinal note dont buy digital deluxe edition want ost doesnt tracks artbook stuff find google images already buy want support atlus beyond content isnt really worth itanyway games go fucking buy finish dont understand game better writing character development compared games come several years gripe possibly retrieve quests rng involved optional dont usually get addicted games want engrossing game buy dont usually like jrpgs much persona games super cool hopefully atlus ports games steam dont usually play many jrpgs well specifically traditional turn based combat titles mean played like paper mario ttyd earthbound prior usually experience jrpgs limited said persona golden great game first persona title finish vanilla persona years ago love game definitely worth especially price anybody doesnt know persona jrpg spin shin megami tensai line created atlus play group teenagers personas personas represent characters overcoming weaknesses like yosukes fear rejection outcast gameplay represented two forms social sim aspects turn based combat part socializing certain people help certain arcana classes im knowledgeable arcanatarot card systems persona like socializing gives reason gameplay wise also reason individual character storylines give greater insight characters thinking reacting certain things certain way also fuse personas stronger ones egor margarettes help dungeons created characters subconscious fearsanxietiesflaws push away peers dont see flaws issuesand helpedare gifted personas unique also fight lot shadow beings help level personas party team also understand dungeons represent psychology theory idegoand super ego id wants desires matter costthe ego keeps keep id checkand super ego moral compass keeping regular ego check im psychology expert see thematic sense persona titles character sees worst parts amplified top degree reject fear thus must beat boss shadow representing character order overcome worst aspects person really cool aspect series gives something titles dont usually tackle certain stuff persona doesnt even smt understand goes entirely different story stuff persona think fine persona pretty great plot characters great arcs around ask mei recommend also personally trying finish dungeons possibleuse free time socializingbooks read stats like intelligence couragebuying armor weapons help give party edge battle also going back dungeons defeat optional bosses helpful armor weapons also helpful giving edge level ups overall great system mechanics gameplay loops make party stronger think anything else gonna play persona golden character writingplotmystery element storyand atmosphere strengths think persona refined polished persona persona lesser gameof course think gameplay loop excellent persona lively community inaba characters connect back eachother like one big happy family persona contrast bigger game fine sacrifice livelier community bigger shibuyathis thing sell lot persona merits gameplay bad underwhelming far persona generally tend certain strengths persona doesnt thats fine think anything else thats makes recommend persona general mention adjustable difficulty option hard time real issue persona fair expect sequels dungeon layouts dont generally tend emphasize lot puzzle solving mean sure great aesthetic changes great mechanically speakingthey dont much change never isnt focus design say think persona dungeon design superior general two game reference persona dungeon crawling like older smt titles really like modern personas though absolutely recommend playing persona golden really great solid game experience im jrpg expert giving general opinion

unique gameplay start explaining work main character game student unlike psp port play boy youre going live entire year life going school hanging friends helping uncle little cousin solving unexplained bizarre murder case supernatural explanation important aspect games thankfully game introduces elements good easy comprehend pace social links connections people around level hanging helping specific times day available also level social skills performing tasks reading books sometimes part game events things influence story important gameplay part influence jrpg mechanicsevery party member get game unlocks persona avatar representation inner power special powers main character ability equip huge number personas unique skills stats strengths weaknesses also somewhat similar guardian force worked suppose also personas also fused together form new personas inheriting skills ones fused elements game directly influenced social sim elements hence constant balance typical dungeon crawling normal lifeits pretty cool idea time works really well gameplay needs story needs complement wouldnt work course gameplay basics werent fun heres persona especially good combat game genuinely engaging fun exploration dungeons getting treasure chests entering fights shadows somewhat bland helped cool visual design awesome soundtrack fights great theyre almost always smart use strengths weaknesses enemies check enemies figure theyre weak hit weakness get extra hit knock everyone get special whole team attack big damage numbers adapt new situation often jrpgs either really tedious fights never pose challenge feel like time wasters way complicated huge amount interesting systems mechanics dont care pace turnbased combat like get overwhelmed tired fight persona part keeps fights brief enough also keeping every one engagingthere annoying exceptions course design decisions frustrating anything like fact main character dies game ends randomly happen quite often start game yet end stops problem though least retry options good work depends difficulty setting extra dungeon originally added golden version vita annoying challenging moments fights difficulty simply spikes really hard grinding part game even severe get least fights fun annoying go takes time youd hope wouldwhich another thing didnt enjoy much game really really long enough stories moments fill time quite lot great emotional story overall bit trite journey persona make feel like youre hanging weird friends ends sad see end time many predictable tired tropes everywhere quite characters stereotypes arent interesting explore even main story potential something amazing would take seriously enough avoid tropes ends giving typical save world ancient beings blah blah elements fine heroic epic jrpg hero person saves world evil feel place tale focuses much interacting people personalities characters also key choices affect ending really badly phrased dont fit dialogue system game oh also jokes situations eyerollingly bad typical teenagers teenager things anime joke stuff wasnt funny feels tone deaf ive seen many gay panic jokes since last time ive watched michael bay movie however long ago characters matter situation always pervy haha pervydespite great moments great gameplay great soundtrack style constantly shine despite longer id want still went back every day play game wont
