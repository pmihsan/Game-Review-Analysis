franchise pc ive played alot rpgs life one game ive actually felt bondyes pun included bite characters every new day new chapter stories reason keep playing mention childish hilarity constantly happeningone thing wrap rise overrated chie best girl bought game expecting enjoy great reviews one friends recommended im somewhat fond genre games well bought far literally worst game ive ever played far whole two redeeming qualities hand drawn cutscenes look really good even though graphics rest game awful story far isnt terrible even though feels really cheesy stupid like even begin explain game badwell might well start fact theres gameplay vast majority game far consisted sitting listening dialogue parts walk around freely parts usually handful things see places go kind defeats whole point able move freely also bunch turn based combat ill talk later isnt necessarily problem ive played games spend time listening people talk choosing dialogue options thing games dialogue usually interesting game boring lines dialogue made feel anything far ive playing five whole hours another thing games little gameplay last maybe hours usually writers good enough compact entire story hours playtime make things interesting still get point across also force players nothing sit listen dialogue hours end game last like think around hours absurdly long time game feels like im playing visual novel last thing usually games like dialogue options player chooses feel like weight affect story way game dialogue options far feel like little consequence fail interesting point ive begun picking first option time know none ones going affect story way terms story keep mind ive played hours isnt terrible feels really cheesy dumb worst thing ive ever seen guessokay lets talk combat combat game mind numbing turn based combat ive ever sit entire life surprise actually ive ever played maybe one two turn based games ive enjoyed yeah combat game mostly consists brute forcing way though every fight first trying find moves deal damage enemy spend rest fight pretty much spamming move limiting factor regard limited number action points play skills felt really annoying combat awful wanted get fast possible anything made fight longer real nuisance prizes get completing fight feel lackluster unrewarding felt like insult every time game forced sit whole fightfinally music graphics suck mentioned earlier hand drawn graphics cutscenes look amazing animation rest game looks completely awful even game made kind wish whole game hand drawn animation would least nice look even though nothing else good since game spent dialogue combat turn based really reason game first place whole game could animation nothing would really change apart graphics better music im definitely music critic dont listen music often far havent heard single track likea lot people ive talked say game starts boring gets better like come five hours kind really long time go without anything interesting happening ideally would want get players hooked beginning ton things dont like game dont want talk right overall real praise give game experience ive far utterly terrible couldnt help laugh everything thats happened far even think kind high price pay game intend play ironically since cant refund game point might get around playing whole thing give fair review also kind dont want sit like hours worst game ive ever played far theres also good chance wont found persona series emulation first emulated persona best experience ever saw came steam knew get eventually regret
