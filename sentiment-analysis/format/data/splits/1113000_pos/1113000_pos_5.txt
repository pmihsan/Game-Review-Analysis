character thus far say didnt enjoy characters development course link completed many ended leaving disappointed point driven fell flat pushed aside another plot whats worse player constantly told youre close people see time great friends end really disliking personality traits see people put high regard towards certain party members theyre constantly horrible person never grew weaknesses makes feel like didnt even play game decided watch bunch cutscenes try draw theyre assumption character wholly mention characters share almost completely identical personal issues tackle differently makes

something along lines old final fantasy pokemon end forced play style lacking diversity opting focus things like allmighty attacks instant kills enemies stop weaknesses vulnerable one form damage mish mashed groups similarly styled enemies feels almost deliberately intended waste time areas game dont require fight enemies others force face constantly enjoyment game probably measured fairly accurately dungeons alone besides one character specifically every side quest game feels like huge waste time shouldnt bothered requires pointless backtracking absolutely awful rewards variety

time however game open couple hours lot longer persona takes worth opens fair amount depth gameplay title solid however one dated mechanics saving like playing hard really like playing anything lower difficulty however died sent back last save since cant save certain points way back go cutscenes hate offputting cant skip cutscenes although fast forward unless anime section despite dated mechanics

review saying game means much changed think life bit dramaticthis game changed lifei havent played game six years lessons ive learned game still important first played let explain game mostly friendship bonds one another dismiss game crappy friendship power anime bull much deals lot relatable stuff parental neglect complete rejection society first played given actively socializing thought waste time due outcast bullied friends didnt really see friends slowly became loner choice persona opened eyes behaving importance bonds embarrassing say sounds really cliche living idea could live rest life without needing others without spoiling story character exact ideology mindset scared way like looking mirror let face view life differently love socializing meeting new people thanks game means much mehere brief summary story persona set small town named inaba upon arrival town mysterious murders occur bodies deceased hung atop telephone poles adds mystery strange midnight channel broadcasts every night murderer uses kill victims gang solve mystery bring peace back quiet rural town story may seem bleak setting first actual tone akin scooby doo really like setting backdrop story characteroriented focuses problems character persona cast characters probably best ive seen game feel soooo real interactions cast feel organic full expression due part fantastic dub honestly one best

could learn characters without doubt highlight game even normally couldnt care less video game characters guarentee theyll fall love ones persona offer story engaging combat part normal jrpg combat enough strategy involved keep thinking push grow strong even jrpgs thing game provides hours entertainment highly recommend anyone let start cons ost digital deluxe edition basically scam tracks

morooka thinks stop love struck baboon fun polygons probably best jrpg available pc long long definitively excellent game reviews seem gushing nostalgia story characters little frustrating want actual informationa review game product porting work feel game known quantity people looking page originally saw game played giant bomb wanted play wasnt buy ill offer anecdotal experience porting work happy say port seems pretty solid isnt perfect goodthoughts keys rebindable game keys bound function keys tilde etc ones might want alphanumerics alt ctrl caps lock etc game discriminate leftright ctrl etc handy someone like ive remapped windows key right ctrl input controls similarly perfect abomination certainly heavy streak console port behavior going ie emulated buttons menu brought tab key vs escape making menu selections little awkward doesnt work exactly like youd expect native pc game however great credit mouse behavior great half baked may enter name one character time vs typing backspacing keys thats works controller click letters quickly dont move cursor keys use dang mouse lot poorer console pc ports fail aspect something take granted ports character movement pretty good though qualified success pretty good port wasd default works bat granted game still designed ground controlled analog stick look little stiff quickly move hard snap though transition characters heading switch directions moving right change direction left character turns vs instantly facing right may seem pedantic thing talk way movement works fundamental gameplay mechanic janky movement would absolutely big effect experience especially game like takes hours hours play graphics settings rather sparse much issue though since game old performance still rock solid need turn anything rendering scale option defaulted buttery smooth monitor im content enough leave everything defaultsmaxed call day game looks good runs good sure much due efficient optimization little render screen sure really care though like low poly art tell texture resolutions never meant seen looks nice counts seems lot assets reworked rather recreated outright stuff looks uprezzed cleaned bit vs redrawn scratch youre one people thought wolfenstein remake looked bad port might eyesore doesnt bother wasnt expecting hd remaster anything keep mind nice cleaning game still game heart expectations kept check reguardless strength original art design ensures still looks great major bug first started apparently amd cards owners issue models get stretched place got sapphire pulse xt igors polys screen dude looked like got hit ied simple graphics driver update solved thisin summaryoverall id say dang good port team clearly work within limitations imposed original capabilitiesconsole native design decisions feel hits wickets looking port without venturing remaster territory havent gotten far yet perhaps issues could arise later far good mr baker folding chair mr baker please sto much fun much
