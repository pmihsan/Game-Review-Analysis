came around years ago enjoy jrpg good singleplayer story lots relationshipdevelopments game youas persona fan id also like see also persona royal ported pcill hand money atlus many others keep releasing persona pc reccomedation solely concept like persona love game honestly game hits vibe persona point really feel sucked world really game amazing complaints lack symbols name skills constantly remeber skills meant also camera angels dungeons god awful recommendation isnt enough fully explain great game series whole recommendation play costs relationship game tales symphonia heard praise years till finally got play didnt like first started think whatever game truly became worthy praisepersona ultimately cute ride im glad got play said wasnt solid hours started carve name itselfthis port psvita version game additional content made port thats fineso essentially enhanced directors cut game made possible vita copy pasted pctheres plenty little things make reminiscent time story beats entire gameplay pieces kept behind way npcs repeatedly things multiple times wouldnt think check unless absolutely everything features like ability refill health magic dungeons without leaving skill tree enhancements party members quest lines unfinishable without telling need order fix couples things point outits clearly meant game play times near impossible everything one go though game takes long though core gameplay elements wish straightforwardthe good news dont want spend time world grinding learning ins outs combat select difficulty right gate want story world persona make feel something set brain dead mode nothing challenge likewise game beat kneesunless particularly fond combat system aims starve resources dont bother least far normal mode went hardest stuff first couple dungeons simply cause lacked things like large enough magic meters small hp refills low items simply knowing enemy weaknessesit worth noting combat lacks makes writing wont go much detail since better play first however littlest details eventually amount something longrun plan playing tend forget things theyre brought factbig question im sure asking long take finish gameit took roughly hours beat main story sidequests fair bit grinding post game normal mode fast forward text cutscenes making go fasteras far glitches go ran maybe three entire time frequent game would go windowed mode despite set fullscreen happened lot dual monitors especiallythe second game softlocking battle one party members used personathe third using speed option combat start battle game straight crashedhopefully things patched eventually id mostly say careful using speed optioni wish least quality life improvements help streamline certain things however long kind guide let know terriblefinal verdict hope got persona games future soon review game good although long time ago release playstation vita late release pc like story since never play playstation vita playstation hope future persona game release pc second jrpg game gonna lie didnt think would finish full play actually ended finishing twicetotally recommend never played jrpg beforebtw rise waifu second persona game one top jrpgs list time game left feeling drained way ending great book makes feel little sad glad persisted see true ending second favorite anime kids manifest spirit power trying catch serial murderer small rural town second favorite game behind finally available pc ive already played times vita version bought collector im glad finally easily accessible many peoplehope many people enjoy know first step eventually getting ported well second favorite game time ive easily put hours im looking forward putting several hundred thing holding back playing games vita bit pain relative able play whatever screen whatever controller want havent put much time framerate doesnt appear locked didnt spaz monitor sure max resolution supports let select imagine anything work sprites look super crisp vibrant minimal complaints far issue ive run motion blur didnt see option disable ill update run issues persona games always remarkably unglitchy im expecting anything gamebreaking time fifth playthrough played original game three times golden vita oncethis one liked games time persona gets lot praise better graphically gameplaywise persona better pretty much every aspect plot characters game much recommend persona game one best jrpgs time please play undisputed favorite game time story characters music unparalleled even todays standards every rpg learn thing two persona series especially youre turnbased combat might slog honestly think give shot even dont typically enjoy kind combat hell bought vita play golden edition back came story time got original version game christmas one year middle school fairly antisocial kid back didnt lot friends may sound corny playing game really help overcome fear branching socially ended making new friends year game always special ps naoto best girl series ill fight first persona game one games last several years actually captivate really hope end adding others steam well vita finally rest peacealso chie best girl wife left game gave enough friends help cope naked true lies realizeanyway good musicvery immersive game combat takes bit thinking strategy characters quirkyi love game presents spoiler reviewi completed game u played like dont tell u u play game u never played persona game first first persona game steam give u reasons u try game well criticisms social sim dungeon crawler main features game dungeon crawling jrpg aspect social sim features game unlike momentos dungeon crawling intertwined main social links things u dungeons still relate u outside open world quests quest mostly fetch quest requiring u return dungeons complete extending play time nothing say dungeon crawling standard like feature battles allow u gain extra turn u exploit weakness enemy get critical hit fact enemies also earn mores makes fights dynamic fun social sim side enjoy characters relate ways theyre incredibly flawed unique qualities help stick one another allows remember time fondly npcs games interacting main party members also allows u gain new skills really useful almost game breakingly socriticism gear based level systems game although skills characters specifically personas carry u game often level gear important getting level max every character really easy best gear every character much harder satisfying things makes fight even boos fights laughably easy augmented powerful personas every enemy cake walk even hardest story enjoy mystery story told like pacing well even major dumps certain parts context makes sense involvement characters also enhanced story unlike set small city means characters familiar one another antagonist protagonists interact frequently allows better understand characters intention motivation getting invested main character stats main character stats knowledge diligence courage expression understanding stat levels dialogue option require least certain level certain stat order choose option result different dialogue moving forward different outcomes encourages u replay game stats u improve carried new game allowing u try new dialogue u could get maybe u high enough stat different interaction people also affect outcomes certain situationstldr jrpg fantastic characters lot

ive finally completed game finally say persona golden favourite series thank god steam port okay since reviews either shitposts vague explaining exactly ill insteadpersona part series called shin megami tensei games play similarly pokemon except rather trying catch every monster run fuse get rid weaker ones get stronger demons majority smt franchise gameplay formula however persona series puts different spin series taking dungeon crawling smt adds unique mechanic spend time living normal life hanging friends things like homework working level stats things portion game directly influence one anotherits perfect game definitely flaws first theres mechanic called social links spend time characters day spending time give xp boost certain types demons fuse problem comes links party members mechanic works well side characters lock character development behind completely optional game mechanic becomes issuethe dungeon crawling also isnt really best series offer go either okay making want stab eyes fork moments far battles pretty fun still best series offerthe important part rpg story game pretty good one story simple friends trying track serial killer discover ability enter another world inside tv theres also speculation world something killers methods fairly simple somewhat engaging story best part characters said story theres lot time put characters hang funny conversations really able connect game really make characters feel like real people towards end kind feels like game dragging long serves cover plot holes arent left unsatisfiedas every smt game story experienced entirely without play games start still enjoy itin must enjoy classic jrpgs rate okay absolutely adore game im really glad see come platform isnt vita thing port absolutely abysmal gameplay least runs
