perhaps best word describe experience persona golden bad part great thats either many things like yet least many things detract experience thing game extremely long issues plus eventual pervading sense bloat add game overreaching overlong even elements shine frequently enough least wanted see end well get positive side think marriage rpg life sim mechanics fairly intuitive meaningful effects accruing money dungeons use real world developing social bonds allow creation stronger personas clever synergy combat usually quite unique fun exploiting elemental weaknesses finding ways opponents proved engaging however boss battles absolute slog two main bosses none following major bosses elemental weaknesses meaning fights devolve tedious whack fests repeating attacks ad nauseum healing necessary boss felled additionally side quests added golden ruin games balance took time complete quests went along left overpowered dungeons became decidedly mindless quests also usually mundane tackedon fetch quests revisit dungeons youve already cleared cant obtain quests pertaining current dungeons bafflingly gameplay loop rooted routine perform limited number actions day usually one daytime activity one evening activity loop really works first enough keep activities varied even felt overwhelming start social links main event optional stories develop relationships numerous characters routine baked long game found autopilot later performing tasks scrolling long walls text hours going motions feeling little long stretches time game also design choices work trekking dungeon consumes day calendar incentivized play much dungeon possible one day clearing one go possible unfortunately bad games pacing rpg life sim elements feel discrete separate rather two integrated parts whole additionally role play element somewhat undermined gameplay implications interactions found pursuing social links characters would grant important gameplay benefits rather characters wanted bond also found trying tell characters thought wanted hear rather wanted character say former would simply benefit gameplay perspective feel game trimmed elements tighter package entire scenes social link characters felt disposable social sim part game number side activities add nothing social stats serve restrict progress certain activities side quests poor inclusion writing mixed bag times game explores interesting themes many characters delightfully entertaining endearing select scenes legitimately funny times characters insufferable games attempts humor fail miserably proves draining entire scenes dedicated extended gags halt plot development social links least could elect pursue social links characters enjoyed helped social sim gameplay along plenty times invested social link stories really bought certain characters experienced personal growth felt great course special mention must go persona treatment particular characters writing ranges mishandled downright distasteful atlus game alright fat character included jokes expense character also victim incessant jokes gay key character development story sees resolving become man reaffirming heterosexuality naotos gender identity whole mess writers clearly equipped tackle game takes many opportunities sexualize underage characters number unfunny slapstick scenes seem contrived entirely purpose placing girls swimsuits games theme acceptance oneself also rings quite hollow text reject several cases game stems company proven miserably intolerant games moral compass also seems bit awry times example one point character equates man losing job murder mans wife presentation decent visuals certainly aged especially character faces environments surprisingly detailed music standout tracks rest mostly serviceable however find reach truth one battle themes perhaps song youll hear easy low point soundtrack unfortunately despite shortcomings made final boss wellequipped dispose yet didnt well pc port one key flaw even close end finally broke motivation see credits simply put game crashes time understand time gpu gets overwhelmed game gives immediately thats bad enough given computers simply running number operations time spikes happen sometimes atlus saw fit release patch surely tidied experience matter fact didnt game much worse lowest resolution setting game cannot play many cutscenes meaning crash consistently thus raise resolution increasing risk crashes everywhere else maybe others wont experience probably saw game go black lock entire desktop least fifty times game crashed leading second phase final boss gave going retrace steps two floors dungeon fight tedious first phase skip dialogue maybe get chance see time crashing worsened games restrictive save system cant save traversing dungeons meaning constantly paranoid losing progress dungeon crawling thus became less fun paranoia ate away enjoyment persona golden might good game good game wrapped layers bloat wants many things doesnt really end great least best qualities lose luster somewhere along overlong runtime enjoy quite time despite flaws eventually game became chore could put faults invested enough story characters want least get conclusion coupling flaws constant crashing dont think game worth time asks jrpgs characters story rich perhaps without many questionable bits accomplish leaner experience forming meaningful bonds characters fighting shadows tv world persona golden offers experience keep players engaged hours come seemed like forever atlus finally put persona title steam sure bring many newcomersploti blast exploring little town inaba wasnt expecting get pulled game much persona introduces player town inaba high schooler moved countryside live uncle cousin heros parents working

thoughts persona golden found working social links could learn persona cast links also help fights makes getting even worthwhile links tricky may want refer guide help properly flesh link links crucial order create stronger personas battle battles persona fun require player think carefully acting sometimes better setting buffsdebuffs instead spamming single button boss fight took several

super funny dialogue little quirks game first felt connected cast characters see many events bonds truly deepen friends even theyre introduced good bit story speaking story story interesting come small town almost soon youre settled hear murder tiny town gets better one thing lacking comparison persona royal gameplay dungeons straightforward find stairs head along way might find key get somewhere compared puzzles basically nothing daily life isnt many places explore youre limited small town halfway summer however lacking compared im saying bad gameplay still amazingly fun going dungeons exploring town finding every little detail small town inaba filled funny characters little places start love persona golden hour game never time gets boring takes bit get going going get sucked straight playing persona decided play persona golden since came steam thanks linkk gifting sadly enough didnt im happy ported since pc finished first play golden story ost characters battle

game word best would put game keep moving word hope atlus would put persona ultimax suplex long story short game alll things need story dating sim please insert coin start persona let game start hope dont play persona steam years old please release asap atlus cool everything else runs smoothly also great due age game play low spec hardware hope atlus sees fact mainline persona games sell great

golden adds much top already amazing experience brainer pick youre fan good storytelling failing understand failing listen rather different things persona truly experience remember first game franchise ive played definitely delivered significant amout entertainment didnt expect considering fact ive pretty much never played jrpgs first thoughts game rather negative though animeish games never attracted even tho love anime approach kinda sceptical first hours tell boi thoughts wrongthe typical weeb slayers cant even stare things second even slight similiarity anime would gritting teeth right seeing games store site overwhelminigly positive reviews hiding store never even trying greatness thus failing listen fact quote beginning directed straightly tell kinda similiar types beginning thats im making deal ive encountered enormous amout people like regarding game anime general point sorry thats rather obvious days cliche saying dont judge book cover would surprisingily powerful situationwell saying wanted say game itselfis f addictinga world inside tv high school drama socializing seemed quite unique first exact reason bought game mostly socializing part nvm plot genuinely intruiging twists place constant enjoyment clearing dungeon getting plotheavy parts might subjective negative part game repetitiveness times repeatedly get objectives rescue person oh rescue someone else completely differentsame dungeon new textures fun like first hours getting kind bored thing still point fact actually rushing game cause literally addicting would taking breaks coming back next day like normal person probably wouldnt case sadly wasdont get wrong tho gameplay actually fun game old aside dungeon thing boss fights super fun ridiculous amout personas fusing fun characters kept playing game almost got pretty much attached actually experiencing thing doesnt happen often case hard get immersed yeah incredibily written characters one particularly mind kanjiwhom meet later without doubt hes best one group complete opposite youd expect laughing ass comedic scenes included pretty much everytime also felt dramatic ones kanji course isnt one thats incredibily written everyone stood opinion basically characters definitely excel game reason realized love game endthe last thing wanted share thoughts beloved soundtrack ah yes pretty much gets praised everyone played persona games theres one big factor deflects awesomeness repetitiveness yes soundtrack alone without doubt outstanding hear many times point almost annoying though persona doesnt many soundtracks considering hours long battle dungeon themesits ones hear boss themes like bosses themes emotional moments etc get point numbers could wrong somewhat like still cant deny soundtrack gets praise damn good reason long ass game take considerationi think negative aspects could easily removed atlus decided make game shorter creating entirely unique dungeon system battle themes single one ultimately enjoyed game much decided write long ass review pretty much sums strong side someone actually read first actual review id appreciate feedback english native language dont go hard regarding p like life simjrpg lives hype skeptical buying first persona game biggest jrpg fan expected quickly tired characters story dubs yes know actually really well done rarity genre characters real lack better words dont feel like idiots actually act like would expect mostly im trying say writing translation great hookedget like stuff akin jojos bizzare adventure typical high fantasy rpgs like

boy howdey atus know youll likely find hating main culprit story writers intended way portrayed actions incredibly welldone text amazing voice acting makes almost sympathize character generic interesting time end game rather cliche good job making feel though youve actually gone adventure characters credits start role youve actually said good bye group friends many games achieve nowadaysoverall good job creating beginning end middle feel rather lackluster since developers focus creating bond main characters main murder mystery taking dragged backseatgameplay place start let begin mentioning social links game social links bonds create teammates less plot crucial characters hanging youre tv lot time feel though social links great giving characters screentime deserve lot arent really interesting instead feeling like creating actual bond certain character felt like optional chore grind many good persona fans know things like slinks confidents theyre known time benefits
