addition although glamorous persona persona still makes stylish game spectacular visuals soundtrack however since original game release models havent aged best models however never concerned throughout playthrough though character sprites voice acting japanese version caught attention chore gameplay turn based combat dungeon crawling also surprisingly enjoyable although excluding never really played turn based combat game could still enjoy combat satisfying feedback kickass soundtrack however boss felt way difficult even normal settings primarily never went way farm conversely taken dont need farm play game focus social aspects game need fight overall first persona game ever played one best experience ever videogame last couple years stimulating diverse emotions allowing smile laugh cry throughout priceless journey game must even non jrpg fans someone skeptical persona series never played outside arena ultimax came game completely neutral clean slate ever mainline persona

soundtrack game comes nine songs game want know songs look google figure believe due licensing issues either way dont tell buy digital deluxe edition nevertheless scummy way persona golden game amazing played original classics series dont fooled mere two hours playtime review bought pc replaying game extremely depth storytelling want journey imaginary high school friends seem like real friends game perfect way relax take break real life bit also enjoying one best social sims youre much virtual friends maybe youll enjoy half game combat actual game play game play pretty engaging opinion fan jrpgs enjoy familiar mechanics said jrpgs dont let game go radar worth buy game pretty lengthy well dont worry dollars case dollars much worth wary digital deluxe edition never played persona game thought never would say thanks pc finishing say favorite ever get play persona royal dont think itll able top persona golden heart knew beat game apparently spent hours want time travel closest thing played game wanted say n word played game didnt want say n word start hours gameplay im thoroughly enjoying game admittedly bit persona fanboy played fes royal q get picture id never actually played yasogami high entries golden moment hours worried wasnt going enjoy main cast grating fought shadow comes halfway first dungeon emotional fallout hooked havent doubted sincein terms quality life youve played persona might couple things feel frustrating lack baton pass golden fantastic job flowing combat much efficiently point im genuinely surprised running engine persona fes porting ps vita game isnt necessarily easy given varying capabilities vita compared pcs especially considering wideranging pc capabilities really well taken care keyboard controller mapping wellhandled command lists change instantly depending last input used host graphical upgrades options make feel astonishingly smooth even fairly lowend pcim aware havent touched story gameplay deeply dont feel qualified comment without experiencing whole game first however absolutely vouch top notch port game deserves experienced new generation crosssection gamers never interested much jrpgs reason got interested friend mentioned music alone would something id love essentially came music im staying everything one little tip regarding resolution issues seems reason first time game runs ignores native resolution offers people mention didnt issues mention worked exiting game launching correct native resolution option showed playing persona never heard persona series generally steer away jrpgs bought recommendation blown away incredible quality title golden popped steam bought immediately im probably halfway think fair say league persona merits however persona must play rpgjrpg fan art music japanese language voice acting terrific arresting even though pc port previous generations game protagonist title finds murder mystery rural japan halfway point game still guessing dunnit actually game hasnt revealed much shape endgame many story vignettes well done comic vein adolescent themes dealt slightly cringey way wouldnt place teen manga anime combat early dungeons bit cheap youll meet many shadows onehit kill attacks halfway point normal difficulty combat become nicely challenging suspect party overpowered endgame flip difficulty higher partially resource management game player trying get high schools students scarce free time real world sections game great one turn feel navigate heros teenage relationships responsibilities quality writing npc quests bit uneven major npcs fairly predictable character arcs others wellwritten engaging surprisingthere nice extras package tremendous amount playtime gives great value money experience series persona royal really enjoyed time despite particularly low moments loved combat palaces fell especially life sim aspect game typically keen fan twitch action games real time combat nice change pace lose hour experience time spent hanging boys befriending many people possiblepersona golden basically bit focused lot less dips pacing life sim stuff already loved feels even better characters given much say interactions various members group feel lot organic less like theyre simply protagonist protagonist think feeling exacerbated small town setting exudes much stronger sense warmth closeknittedness huge city tokyo sometimes lacked although understand appeal larger scale game genuinely feel though basically perfected life sim stuff unfortunately tradeoff seems dungeoncrawling lot tedious rather telling story environments like combat arenas essentially collection dark hallways containing little way personality sections feel lot like begrudging means end rather opportunity storytelling course im glad atlus chose change approach dungeons later helps turnbased combat still really fun rewarding despite decrease depth combat music dare say even better seriously shocked find soundtrack matched quality even surpassed timesi complained combat bit thats lacks little compared genuinely phenomenal system still really good story one engaging ive ever experienced video game final stretch narrative puzzle pieces slowly fall place adrenaline pumping heart racing harder game since maybe sekiro considering latter brutally difficult action game former fcking turnbased jrpg says lot think please please please give shot especially havent tried persona game serious time commitment wouldnt way trying persona spent little year without really enjoying game played didnt want actually sit butt play seemed tedious task even though playing games always best medicine lifes numerous beatdownspersona brought back joy used feel playing video games enjoy every part game despite fact ive lost couple hours sleep work days suspect lose coming weeks worth thank ask yes played game vitathis favourite persona game main cast alone every girl waifu every guy husbando game easy side compared persona

port come atlus youve seen youre missing port persona smt games pc please btw ports great games great yukiko best girl chie go eat steak ditch beaches shores coming back game many years mixed bag say least originally played persona playstation golden even existed time game blew away compared often laughable character development lot selfdescribed narrativefocused rpgs era persona talking sexuality gender identity struggle individual social systems tradition voice acting stellar especially compared contemporaries like final fantasy struggled enormously make jump written text full voiceacting small town lovingly rendered incredible fidelity engaging visual design held points frustratingly samey rng dungeons overtly grind focused quest crafting system disappointing seemed worth putting experience gamenow coming back game needless say many narrative choices bitter swallow game still many points favor anything else say shoji meguros soundtrack remains like nearly everything career triumph replaying shojis games means months running soundtrack compilations background work qualms placing work uematsu great composers game visually beautiful even hd reveals moments ugliness landscapes beyond hospital windows sharply geometric light blooms constant fades black mask missing gestures movements high fidelity tricks exposed tricks highlight extent original team went deliver beautiful product constraints era technology many dungeons cannot escape looking bit dull thanks procedural generation others take advantage simplicity create striking visualsthe characters narrative though game constantly forgets lessons betrays stances go great lengths help person struggling society sexualizes body image turns around encourages sexualizing objectifying travel character struggle sexuality arrive conclusion whatever personality interests deserve respect dignity game uses straightpanic homophobic jokes character clearly struggling gender identity possibility transitioning comes realization accept varied nature relationship gender essentially talked heterosexual romance problem lambasting narratives social links within nearly every one makes good point addresses real human struggle says something positive profound almost cases message ignored cheap laughs wallow lazy tropes times larger story faces similar conflict game contains good murder mystery sufficient exceptionally realized clues help follow along arrive conclusion part hard criticize overall plot however like many jrpgs plot goes crazy hour good reason spoilers old game dealing real culprit path games true ending treated series conflicts beings revealed pulling strings behind scenes whole time terrible writing coming heels good writing plot murder mystery structurally thematically builds conflicts namatame adachi despite knowing ahead time going happen tense nervous nanakos kidnapping approached adachi good villain hes selfcentered resembles fantastic hyperrealized serial killer deploys twisted logic follow monologues resemble real murderers obviously barring persona business pivot sagiris izanami infuriating supported game youve playing point youve experienced weird noir setting done gumshoe detective work surrounded police procedure struggled balancing punishment revenge themes comfortably support mythic fantasy game devolves end making golden tell original team realized extent problem bulk additional content marie attempt pad ending set pieces soften blow izanamis appearance reality taking game detective horror detective horror hardly fix making ending adachi making actually murders town something line entire plot would far helpful marie lackluster addition though golden content make smart choice expanding main characters interactions adachiall game like final fantasy stumbles finish line many regards frustratingly bungles climax main plot climax many social link sub plots point many outstanding moments incredible emotional impact came side recommending ratio also think important times experience art fails fundamental flaws persona fails queer female characters particular wallows childish homophobic sexist jokes unacceptable time coded frustratingly contradictory subplots moments resonate deeply coming really excited play mechanics sure step fair older game great game enjoy play already coming persona persona royal game still good enjoy lot may mechanics makes sense since game older still resembles persona know nice yet finish game time writing ill probably complete achievements coming persona royal persona honestly shocked honestly interested games premise cast location combat pretty good feel actually challenged compared baby steps taken hardest diff played normal graphics obviously par makes sense considering decade release times even game still brilliant look art style overall even piece interested j u get dollars well worth coming persona certainly different definitely seems like good changes increased difficulty full clearing dungeon day stutters bit thats happens port game pc coming persona wasnt sure expect game easily better story opinion battle system works well bit curve difficulty since early dungeons feel like difficultfor cant go wrong give least hrs gameplay single file still holds really well coming persona richer diverse characters emotional intriguing narrative however really bad dungeon design mechanics dungeon really meaningful causes frustration layout way linear creates one dimensional gameplay dynamics unlike problem affects otherwise excellent combat system literally need go dungeons go combat overall however would say narrative really stands strong music art direction really help make game shine one best persona series coming persona seem primitive years two console generations older given though surprising similar games mechanics pretty much identical story hits basically beats means still enjoyable game even execution much lower levelits fairly obvious ui controls port handheld version ps vita apparently could probably done adapt pc functional though every often im left black screen game running rendering alttab away back fixes coming persona

found fixes dont work everyone heres hoping patch still great game though things considered well worth bucks get past bugs heres hoping get persona pc first want say hate persona life never understand got popular kid every aspect awful made never play persona got persona made think go back play older ones see anything changed give chance still hate persona nothing changed anyone likes persona im sorry said reason bring put perspective others like game worth time still got faults persona course originally like nearly bad story characters opinion charming im nitpicker like complete everything one decided lay back try percent first run like persona tell definitly worth nearly wits end trying one would drive batty look characters like first try bond second playthrough social stats increased go ahead even though remake spouting features original like voice option see others tell alot complaints persona taken care makes bit sad havent played plus side ive managed avoid spoilers game nearly years enjoyable kids like try giving game try adults never bothered want play turn based game might worth shows age combat isnt balanced properly might end tinkering difficulty settings want boss bit harder also want speed trash monsters doesnt interfere social links good solid game ive experienced keeps laughing first im huge fan persona series ive heard many praises game however similarly numerous negative reviews game unplayable face myriad constant freezecrashing issues playthrough dungeon game went least six different freezes mid battle loading screens way able finish dungeon play windowed mode pausing game whenever task manager clocked computer cpu usage mean could play game pausingunpausing game every seconds however port acclaim company seems bit much id recommend game friends freezingcrashinglagaudio issues fixed id say game unplayable game fully playable players recommended specs first im going start review recommending game wholeheartedly doesnt tell whole story see lots didnt like game ill mention bit fundamentals game combat game mechanics solid regardless qualms im fully intending get persona comes steam could persona better absolutely still great game also absolutelyit feels fitting perverse sense persona comes across game two duelling natures conceit game protagonists rather heros friends face side character wish keep hidden gain persona allows fight use magic etc game mirrors duality simultaneously engaging host juvenile cringe comedy really really dislike yet also social links exploring far sensitive darker topics im entirely sure pulls doesif like far fan cringe comedy consider detest type comedy yet still hesitation recommending game thats testament rest gamethe game essentially follows pattern throughoutyou go school interact fellow students people meet whilst part time jobs hero leads friends investigating supernatural serial murder mystery course uniquely placed investigation work generally thwarting another potential murder rinse repeat formula leads far ideal pacing issues sadly dont investigation one go lose sorely needed time build social links raise stats vital want fully complete game speak someone came back bite arse unable complete characters bonding events result needed unlock true ending time read ill probably started second game order long story short optimally play game encouraged dungeons one sitting tonne talking next one optional bosses show redo last dungeon strikes optimal sitting next dungeon thats ideal also ideal game kind peters dont true ending available essentially lot relationship building combat ending screen like said flawedthe actual mystery story strikes strongest final big reveal thats much negative climax seeing murderers identity coming feeling murderer suffered bit evil voice dont get reference english comedy duo called mitchell webb sent hercule poirot dramas sketch noting villainess gets pointed poirot character seems dramatic shift top cartoonishly evil story felt like lot care devoted internal consistency many rpg ive played still gets big nod approval methe combat system good solid turn based system although virtually tactical flexibility comes hero shift personas awful lot potential ones choose create make fulfil role desire whilst friends locked single persona flexibility comes skills keep choose ones discard persona limited game makes bones character centre group friends largely orbit mechanically relationship wiseto honest makes sense comes combat characters flexibility would become unwieldy sadly however relationship angle whilst bad games means women available harem game bonds characters feels rather one note strength bonds mc evoke would feel much stronger two friends entered relationship game progressed say bonds group whole would much stronger alas however ideal game regards unlikely ever released take get least genuine bonds friends even get downplayed else used comedythe music excellent admit heard opening music wonder second let expected track fits placement superbly even stripping back almost completely excellent effect disturbing timesthe quality localisation hearkens back localisation jrpgs era unsurprisingly given game released largely translation rather localisation come across occasional clunky phrases make appreciate far localisation come thats say gets way enjoying story dont worry found nostalgic waysthe voice acting largely decent apart one character nanako felt pretty poor delivery sadly silent protagonist everyone speaks mc mc speaks unvoiced game prompts chose option feels completely unnecessary isnt role play different characters none beats story character interaction changed measurable extent choices ditch silent characterless hero give real depth silent heroes always feel waste potential thats general criticism trope one particular gamethe supporting characters tend painted vivid colours rather true light shade cringe humour gets employed lead caricatures dont deviate far common tropes graphics would expect generation console released upon like many jrpgs ability fall back anime artistic styles allows hold age better many western rpgs similar vein setting game japan rather fantasy nonearth world allowed game stay unapologetically japanese trait really really liked always find jrpgs fascinating way tend incorporate western concepts deities cultures mesh finished product felt like given glimpse japanese culture would normally exposed toso highly recommend game criticisms sound negative remember pick holes yet still hesitate recommend game first amazing made way pcit one best games ever simply play dont get wrong starts slow play love time world characters first cutscenes dont play perfectly system fine though cant give good job every way main game run ultra smooth throw killer story choice give cant stand jrpgs stay away game skittles jrpg world explosion rainbow story goodness could sworn existed

absolute bore lot time spent dull repetitive dialogue boxes flying inbetween actually interesting moments interactions feel like persona golden suffers one main issue thats drags iwayi long game long isnt necessarily issue becomes issue lot hours spent dull repetitive moments persona golden could cut said moments turn experience hr experience less dull moments would probably game book wish could

okay admit golden hands running away beat quite annoying otherwise round applause gem game look forward entries persona series first persona game love newcomers persona franchise enticing generally best thing point persona opinion characters soundtracks arguably turn based gameplay story personally something im big fan well easily one better story rich rpgs animoo tropes taken account far gameplay involved id say im fan social link free time system doesnt wanna partake befriending virtual characters youre stay home introvert far turn based combat goes easily one favorite renditions genre mainly due weaknessresistance system fights done turns guy rarely plays turn based games honestly one best approaches one thing imagine might fan calendar system effectively means play whole years worth ingame time per story pacing occasionally losing focus story events however make experience worthwhile people coming back persona honestly say despite looking really dated many ways kinda tbh id honestly say persona stands test time honestly digestible experience overlook era visuals rather early thing taken account would need keep mind noticeably lower quality life aspects said opinion persona better cast even better story persona taken account persona one best rpgs ive ever played life arguably better persona ways one astounding atlus even released platform
