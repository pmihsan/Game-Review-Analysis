issues plenty nostalgia also played version looong time ago like nearly spent hours game sorry trophies could show proof cannot make mistake picking game love japanese roleplaying games old times turnbased combat monster collecting emotional stories nicely fleshed characters could go buy thank loved fun definitely recommend caveat im sure everyone enjoyed persona enjoy big differences believe persona magic charm exists games difference mainstream things lot better rest review comparison two games spoilers hopefully make job deciding worth easier better interactions character development within core group shuffle time card minigame sometimes played fight give different kinds bonuses bonuses stat increases equipped persona chest key hpsp recovery exp gain battle etc really enjoyed system especially allows upgrade equipped persona little incentive keeping persona one dungeon able keep persona dungeons kept upgrading magic stat ridiculous levels parts overarching story intriguing think story great stakes predictably kept getting higher higher end much mystery multiple twists turns sidequests personally didnt really thats thing though sink hours side quests random npcs theyre akin mementos missions plentiful dont involve fighting least directly bettermore generous system recovering sp pretty much forces equip sp adhesives party maintain sp throughout dungeon always disappointing got cool accessories one equipped maybe swapping boss fight eventually gives sp back fight meaning never need worry sp towards end long fights efficient protagonist better opinion im really sure describe felt awkward ren yu straightup baller dungeons imuchi worse singlehandedly biggest disappointment coming dungeons mementos puzzles almost nonexistent things separating one dungeon next aesthetics background music colors shadows shadows recycled one dungeon next text lines final boss dungeons grindy palaces fun exciting little incentive leveling social links bonus get outside core teams social links extra fusion exp method gaining personas dungeons less interesting get shuffle time interrogating shadows however could see people liking system interrogation sometimes frustrating think fun overall combat opinion less engaging theres baton pass much incentivized make protagonist oneman army furthermore im huge fan personally combat less reliant allout attacks allout attack pretty much means combat arent sure youll win could always switch interrogation end combat way allout attacks need carefully planned finishing blow substantially less damage id often find utilizing lot physical moves basic attacks fights became pretty stale got good physical powerhouses started spamming aoe attacks worse ui say ui simply master class everything far less intuitive

fun also naoto best girl really enjoyed amazing one best soundtrack gaming also amazing gameplay awesome animation wonder anime really enjoyed persona much played royal release came since wanted play game couldnt justify buying ps vita one game playing completing story true ending persona golden fine game indeed clearly see many people love cast characters general tone game great possibly even better persona despite game serial murder quite lighthearted doesnt lose overemphasising world themes mark good game make feel variety emotions playing persona balances humour dark elements sombre scenes well though social links fairly straightforward good job making emphasise like game takes full advantage smaller setting world compared persona especially locations explore game seven main areas four fully explorable freeroaming areas works games favour though gives player sense attatchment world allows familiarize town quickly love dungeons used explore key characters persona dungeons represent desires various criminals however persona dungeons used explore characters actually care save battle quite literally inner demons makes feel much determined complete dungeons better understand characters even actually clearly refined games sequel see lower section soundtrack amazing knows amplify themes game help express important emotional moments peaceful days special mention goes home soundtrack changes spoilerthe time nanako kidnapped nobody home really makes want save even spoiler anime cutscenes great real treat every time one appears cap important moment game also really like opening movie technical level terms port pretty solid staying consistently throughout except rare occasions game wants display animated cutscenealloutattack whatever reason terms content port youre pretty much getting full package theres hitches though see section youre interested however experience image ghosting frames especially evident turning camera though didnt significantly impact experience nanako didnt like digital deluxe bundle total waste money get hastily thrown together pdf file containing pages art already possible unlock game low quality music tracks lets honest youre going listen youtube anyway chucked random folder dig game files get persona definitely refined gameplay persona number ways leading quite jarring first especially played game first really evident dungeons randomly generated mazes opposed expertly designed palaces sequel unfortunately make going dungeons bit slog especially shadows hitbox appears roughly size pea thankfully basic combat system holds well even without refinements baton pass system persona gameplay loop still maintains interest even sorely miss bells whistles made sequels dungeon crawling much entertaining side note love shuffle time minigame might get battle adds unexpected layer depth dungeon crawling despite simple concept actually wish carried forth mentioned however despite actual rpg elements refined persona eager progress story particularly interesting dungeons tying important characters enjoyed progressing dungeons see happened next assets havent quite scaled well viewing monitor opposed handheld game designed ui elements feel like scaled bit big especially text real shame also couldnt find higher quality files anime cutscenes definitely look quite grainy running game high resolution models textures also appear bit blurry although nice changed character portrait art use high resolution assets bonus materials removed port trailers anime adaptation pretty good anime way unlike persona animation well clips music event trailers previous persona games information persona arena port also doesnt include interviews japanesekorean cast part bonus material none cuts worth losing sleep removed contain obsolete information anyway looked online japanese voice seems pretty compressed low quality whatever reason whereas english voice seems use much higher quality recording plot persona interesting kept guessing throughout even spoileri guessed fairly early leading slightly disappointed twistspoiler extra dungeon added form spoilerhollow forestspoiler good enjoyed integrated story spoileralthough dungeon bit gimmicky enjoyable sort seems like came paper didnt consider fun would practicespoiler really surprised however spoilersecond twist last day game really loop many lingering questions didnt see reveal coming actually quite impressed although wish true ending wasnt tacked behind series actions almost require walkthrough find spoiler pc port brings potential mods interesting see modders enhance game steam course comparing persona sequel bit moot point given sequel improved many ways however fans persona like want give previous entry go hearing great things think fair point differences even persona smooths rougher edges present game would argue youre getting good interesting story cast characters excellent fastpaced style combat fantastic world fall love fantastic game actually makes question ideas morals game isnt afraid make player contemplate important themes tests morals choices affect outcome game becomes higher work art like successor persona golden oneofakind masterpiece realises genre fullest potential really enjoyed playing game soundtrack amazing along cast characters would recommend game anyone loves playing jrpgs really enjoyed

welllets hope atlus continue releasing games steam thought dreaming man really persona golden pc japannese audio thank much atlus love rip vita emulator thought pretty cool thought wasnt going good wow wrong took chance persona golden back ps vita time didnt really know expect certainly didnt expect become one favorite games timebefore knew ended exactly thanks fun engaging murder mystery story wonderful soundtrack unique blend rpg social sim gameplay strong unique cast charactersyou take role silent protagonist forced move family small countryside town inaba year eventually new friends end getting wrapped serial murder case decide work together save victims bring killer justice youll explore dungeons fight enemies turnbased battles typical rpg inbetween dungeons youll live days ordinary high schooler hang people around town read books watch movies go fishing work parttime jobs simplest way describe gameplay would part social sim part dungeon crawler former real draw game youll spend majority time persona else building relationships others key grants bonuses abilities help battle also reward see character grows big part fun figuring efficient way spend time see characters story end reason keeping multiple saves highly recommended hand also important accept simply wont see everything first playthrough even guide try get bogged optimizing schedulepersona goldens biggest strength lies main cast theyre one lovable memorable group characters ive seen game thanks part stellar english dub cast interactions always joy watch bounce well really feel like believable group friends course story end coming literally facetoface suppressed inner thoughts negative emotions running theme game importance selfacceptance one favorite characters example difficulty gaining acceptance others due society viewing hobbies feminine people constantly deride unmanly hobbies result puts macho begins lash others keep getting close fear rejection character arc struggle break free false labels placed others accept really isyoull also come know plenty characters outside main cast hitormiss always looking forward seeing stories unfolded one case even ended turning around character negative first impression learning soundtrack incredible hands one favorite osts game perfectly complements games smalltown setting generally easygoing vibe almost every song instantly memorable insanely catchy still find relistening day due games structure length tracks youll hearing ia loti personally never grew tired themfor game right dungeon crawling undoubtedly biggest flaw dungeons incredibly barebones consisting long stretches randomly generated hallways doors enemies fight occasional treasure chest loot although battle system fastpaced easy understand dungeons start feel like slog thankfully unlike original vita release fine tune difficulty time start allowing alter amount damage give take even amount exp money gain bandaid solution find getting frustrated plus like game terribly difficult first place least normal idea first playthrough breezed everything past first couple dungeonslength another common valid criticism game ilong regular playthrough take around hours making pretty big time commitment somewhat related obtuse requirements obtaining true ending surprisingly easy lock getting important save often make use every save slot given unless youre actually willing start whole new playthrough miss one thing ill say regarding getting true ending prioritize spending time certain character aeon arcanahonestly cant recommend game enough anyone whos fan jrpgs andor characterdriven stories fact serious steam review ive ever written probably ever write say lot much love one games ive played really managed stick long credits rolled much also
