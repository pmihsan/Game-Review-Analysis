better original still favourite say personally think golden better golden fixes problem mentioned original simple solution better always true negatives new features making combat easy personally dont mind combat example never strong suit smt games jrpgs general tend always braindead linear buffattackheal games kill mobs strikes lack semblance real thought provoking strategy focusing away negatives golden adds qol changes new events new lines new social links new endings stuff seems minor considering fact im someone didnt like original yet consider golden masterpiece really isnt minor new events bring lot life empty gaps nothing happened story really help connecting getting invested cast nothing important happens theyre silly sliceoflife events addition godsend thematically happy game friendship also ways hang connect cast encouraged makes statistically stronger youre like couldnt connect cast original version youll connect golden new lines also great sometimes bit iffy times obvious new line due quality tone voice acting suddenly taking dip theyre usually far specific character got completely different voice actor voice bit jarring comparison original va first eventually grows quality voice acting top notch path towards true ending also better paced fleshed addition extra month play along new character social link pieces story together makes true ending seem place relation rest game isnt perfect fix decent fix new things golden brings whole patches lot holes feel original better amplifies games themes amplifying enough consider absolute masterpiece game isnt

cutscenes getting skipped automaticallyps always save anime cutscene often causes crashes steam hours recorded mostly plays offline ive played hours october gameid say maybe first time long time invested game let alone something thats quite narrative heavy like story maybe first felt like mundane spend hours find enjoys expected story fun easy follow social links character arcs supporting casts isnt felt like hastle except several times need know spesific thing unlock social links though theres guides easily look tothough battles think nothing special typical jrpg course turns either maybe dungeon crawling tedious sometimes lessened configuring difficulties gives penalty game achievement wise set exp money helps bunch game really great fun story thats worth money dive battle also nice like typical jrpg dungeon crawling turn based battle even arent easy catch itps waifus best unfortunately telling whos favorite considered spoiler x game something cant real life like fighting
