superb pc port great psp remake awsome gamethe game one guy stuck small town year guy trying solve mass murder mystery new friendsgolden easier personas manegment compared original game greatcombat engaging annoyng unlike persona companions suck ass fn retarded moronsalso game autosaves every dungeon level making dungeon crawling less dangerous originali hope atlus release persona royal pc also perevious titles intention buying quality sonys conole dropping tremendously release new console forever reminds makes happy review comes someone played persona recently released persona royal however ive heard many good things persona golden happened buy game release day sunk hours plan ng soon originally going write review halfway game felt finishing game would allow better perspective pros cons game safely say however game masterpiece hit jrpg lovable characters emotional story great music battle system simplistic yet addicting comedy point numerous personas create via fusion plentiful great design blend life simulator dungeon crawling may seem odd however urges player manage limited time wisely everyday choosing whose social links prioritize activities engage negative aspects people may enjoy fact persona golden originally came ps vita age definitely shows sp management dungeons also issue newcomers make first dungeons particularly difficult despite cons game consistently builds upon theme facing challenges life dollar jrpg hours depending much optional content partake believe entirely worth price time make history review goes got spoiled major event game wondering game still worth picking upyes absolutely identity someone important spoiled literally day released say yes detract mystery game much offer cannot simply spoil everything game offer words even sentencesincredible writing lovable characters incredibly indepth combat system hundreds hours contenti would recommend game anybody likes good story even dont typically like turnbased rpgs something everyonehowever despite high praise game isnt perfect dungeons imo boring especially coming persona every dungeon flat plane corridors laid randomly floor dungeons also usually contain floors floor take minutes complete prepare lot game also difficulty hikes entirely easy depending playstyle tedium dungeon layouts starting skip enemies rush dungeon single day lead bosses able onehit ko entire party however dont feel bad whatsoever turning difficulty change damage deal damage taken exp gained money gained overall difficulty find falling asleep dungeons like bump difficulty easy worry clearing whole floors enemies progressstill gripes aside believe best rpg steam right cannot recommend game anybody wants experience something truly unique rpg games youll find well made persona im assuming well probably check daynow port persona royal steam cowards review intended others like introduced persona series fell love jumped opportunity try older entry series without buy ps vita absolutely adored spent hours playing vanilla royal editions review comparing also im giving scores individual aspects game graphics sound story etc final score overall impression game average scores section tldr think superior game overall read reasons however still greatly enjoyed totally understand many prefer visuals serviceable visuals weak point even taking account original released ps vita games era look better eg final fantasy x released looks better game blows game water comes visuals age like fine wine due bold neonoir artstyle compare menus ui loading screen youll see amount polish refinement visuals compared sound soundtrack jpop jrock vibe stark contrast acid jazz soundtracks incredible still prefer soundtrack overall absolutely loved one overall sound production quality mixing etc definitely superior game still sounds great shoji meguro genius gameplay dungeons almost every gameplay element refined notably dungeons dungeons randomly generated change every visit every dungeon basically thing different skin mementos widely regarded one tedious aspects every dungeon basically mementos ambushing enemies also quite different ambush enemies hitting behind weapon hitbox targeting kind janky might standing right behind still whiff also lot narrow corridors like mementos difficult sneak behind shadows wait eventually turn around takes way long ended fighting lot battles head missed hearing reach truth plays ambush enemy certain boss battles enemies enemy design somewhat uninspired basically every dungeon monsters palette swapped gain personas reward cards end fight enemies personas collect like catching pokemon theres way enemy diversity also fairly easy game beat whole thing almost exclusively using izanagi main character doesnt particularly good stats attributes frequently change actually use newly acquired personas particular relied heavily upon null physical attribute never bothered quests quests predominantly tedious fetch quests largely involve revisiting previous dungeon farm items enemies stopped realized lacklustre rewards quests mementos missions take boss way fun interesting imo fighting random shadows gain find one drops particular item youre looking social linksconfidants social linksconfidants overall quality better sociallinks encountered throughout course main story whereas many social linksconfidants totally random people dont anything seek eg devil death hermit tower hanged man sun moon temperance strength also ranking confidants unlocks abilitiesgameplay perks provides incentive complete whereas ranking confidants gets exp boost fusing persona arcana games reaching max rank unlock ultimate persona arcana freedom things night vastly prefer morgana constantly telling go bed although improve however tedious going different locations see social links confidants available whereas available confidants conveniently displayed mapstory characters shines theyre incredibly endearing really get attached game progresses plot isnt particularly original doesnt even matter strong characters makes want keep playing see next interaction group friends personally prefer cast plot easily see many would prefer cast however definitely develops final member party far better counterpart despite less ingame time rest cast character felt fullyfleshed integrated team everyone else werent able accomplish final party member new characterconfidants handled better compared theres really compelling reason spend time new character aside sake extra content whereas new characters better integrated main storyline although without faults overall impression thoroughly enjoyed mostly basis wonderful cast characters however started youll find visuals gameplay elements clearly inferior depending preferences storycharacters may make review less persona persona series whole see best designed rpgs history relatively little time experience due time hoarded things games currently starting second playthrough experience new content lot passion game design anything level design battle mechanics visual design love studying analysing things done done way done effect execution experience game end persona absolutely thrashes every typical turnbased rpg seriesthe best way describe every turnbased jrpg choice beat something keels may myriad status effects spells battle mechanics rarely interact meaningful let alone satisfying way games persona even basic battles reward knowledge strategy every rpg reason even bother spells status effects debuffs dont benefit partys output battle simply serve hinder output enemies times mere goons rarely require result battle system unsatisfying simply stack unrelated mechanics whose real correlation turnbased nature themin persona strategy everything every single thing connection another mechanic way attack defense buffs incredibly valuable even evasion powerful stat buff battle skills status effects like burn shock help increase teams output technical attacks hitting elementaltype weaknesses open shadows strong attacks forth every single move make value almost everything lead chain reaction absolute beatdowns whatever youre fighting point know enemy youre prepared ican lose every single time strategy work way enemies things make difference persona opposed slight conveniences games like damage ability block using one type attack etc etc come inconveniences theres zero reason bother fight actually tests endurancethe stories persona games always incredible well find dialogue bit cheesy take seriously times think events hand incredibly dark theming games absolutely fetish cant get enough good theming stories one thing persona always persona death inevitable need treasure every moment world awful place cant deny need others side help get society cruel doesnt mean cant make difference unfamiliar theyre talked kinda play get whereas youll never really hear people screaming good arethe overworld social mechanics well incredibly interesting social links really something ive ever seen games honestly hard judge make comparison could even better worse dont know havent seen people better worse incredibly fascinating impacts battle system impacts fusing personas sure end day largely progressiongating system sorts like various minixplevel systems time allows grow characters enjoy discover especially valuable persona given theme facing worst everyone around incredibly interesting concept one thats also really without compare idefault ii cant recommend enough persona helped massively expand battle system infinitely satisfying adds even batshit insane
