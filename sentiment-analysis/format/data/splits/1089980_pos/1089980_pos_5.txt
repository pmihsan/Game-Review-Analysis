adventure games thats series games pretty much get one games long fairly entertainingall one huge nostalgia trip loved love would recommend friends love soundtrack great game love game great story telling funny quirky moments leave tearsgreat sound track effect soundssmooth animationsheaps posibilites hours fun le funny le meme play le funny good work old series learned game markiplier instantly fell love series funny engaging let start review saying henry stickmin games near dear heart remember playing first long hours school absolute blast even knew gags coming said im going divide review parts first half thoughts updated versions first games half thoughts seemingly final game series completing mission ctm final thoughts collection wholefirst gameplay gameplay games fairly straightforward click different options one option one needed proceed fun fails far know pretty much every possible choicefail remained first games outcomes changed little keep gags fresh welcome relief oldtimers like changes throw things little second sound design sounds remained several sounds altered due source material using copyrighted sound effectssongs understand necessity replacements dont quite fit still prefer outcome got rather puffballs united getting sued oblivion finally graphics surface may seem like much compared original counterparts visuals major upgrade especially breaking bank oldest one series get little harder notice fleeing complex ftc infiltrating airship ita oldtimers like able spot differencesand newest game henry stickmin saga ctm gameplay mostly consistent previous games one major deviation see first games written albeit sequential endings game could canonically lead next matter route picked ctm however theyve acknowledge previous games order keep every ending cannon start ctm get choose endings ita ftc get start offers lot creative flexibility least devs comedic timing fails point although falls heavily references points theyre still done well enough get laugh majority fails visuals done upmost polish well much polish put stick figure game par visuals rest collection speaking whichas collection whole theres several things like bios every character welcome change provides good opportunity jokes visual style lot cohesive helps keep everything consistent especially youre hopping back forth completing achievements overall nice seeing little flash series brought desktop despite praises couple nitpicks able switch full screen without game going haywire one along controller support finally several times throughout collection game would freeze frames made collecting bios much harder even couple crashes ctm werent part joke still im willing forgive since puffballs united fairly new making desktop games least afaik look forward whatever make next although im fairly certain theyre done henry crazy schemes case id give collection hearty recommendation let tell expecting much game suprised mei wont lie tell need buy game playing allow trancend reality good hours fun get achievements number amount time took et good guides go alone get every ending ones want end worth south african currency unit hoestly reccomend lets see hmm ah yes game quite enjoyable story interesting ctm depending pathway choose though already played least one henry stickmin flash games rtb ftc practically already know ending ones played makes slightly irritating go back play endings get achievements however artwork improved flash games environments even characters lot detail also like new bio addition since adds little personality every single character even skeleton bio light game play awesome sense humor lightning grenade huge explosion apparently like everyone else nothing praise said game ive always loved playing games years watching people like mark play seems curtain close gotta say one grand finale happy see hope people havent ever played give try honestly worth get think favorite thing choice aspect even right decision still get see great humor ive made wrong choice multiple times purpose didnt want win wanted see joke coming next game makes want complete see thoroughly thanks part childhood enjoyed every moment like many people played episodes lot still flash games loved every minute theyre one fantastic game brand new episode well previous episodes beautifully remastered full hilarious references games memes great soundtrack simple yet great story game loved henry stickmin series flash games get game havent played flash games still highly recommend like people bought game loved henry stickmin flash games child delighted see part internet history wasnt going lost flash died also delighted see new game series completing mission good completing mission also comparably long ill give section reviewreturning gamestheres nice changes unfortunate victims map map feature allows jump every single choice ease makes searching specific failures youve missed much easier dont watch animations youve already seen get back choicebios right clicking character unlock small biography card read menu adds nice treasure hunt feeling playing game lot descriptions pretty funny helps recognize dozens minor characters repeat appearances entire storylines play throughout series caused henrys antics even annoying trying get joe schmoe appears half second background one shot copyright compliance becoming forprofit game available steam meant creators refactor lot sound effects music references avoid copyright infringement used sound effects ripped straight video games makes sense replacements often lower quality egregious stealing diamond room four options neutered video game reference room metroid super mushroom crowbar pokeball many ending musics missing original mojo less problem later completing mission composed entirely original generics musics theyre referencing theyre pretty goodui looked little wonky playthrough many buttons text offset button instead think designed screen resolution glitch looked weird enough couldnt tell biggie got used eventuallycompleting missionoh god loved much every new game series noticeable step quality predecessor except escaping complex ctm biggest jump failures puts slightly lower failures games series combined add extra length elaborate fails im looking minute jojo reference fact different timelines means intro ending cutscenes game content rest series timelines oh yeah completing mission plays different timelines depending upon endings happened infiltrating airship escaping complex contrary expecting henry stickmin things approach helps create three dimensional characters example secondincommand toppat clan distrustful people havent proven loyal feels consistent actions every timeline feel like thats character would situation means character dont get started charles particular obsessionand still reference slapstick humor old games think lands consistentlyis worth lot people try value games hours played per dollar front value pretty low pay hours watching cutscenes occasionally clicking button days find care much enjoyed moments spent game long metric value well worth smiling laughing pretty much constantly got nice warm nostalgia buzz treasure yearstldr worth like stickmin games kid like slapstick reference humor wait sale humor isnt cup tea like flash games used play child well guess one rebuilt modern age collection years old feels like havent aged day fun still liked lot nice community awesome game listen game childhood growing opinion game still stands little point replaying
