game works kinda like choose adventure theres setup youre presented choice sometimes timed choice leads certain result commonly fun failure things go terribly wrong youre presented choice retry make another choice correct choice might correct choice leading branching narrative full silly failure events endings luckily map game allows jump choice exceptions select different optionits incredibly dumb full jokes injokes references memes lots also quite old internet standards unsurprising since series originally started since yet vast majority feel genuinely fun well delivered often using reference build joke rather use joke story silly yet time committed final game series one added ton plotlines based possible endings couldve gotten preceding two games lot many characters reappear throughout story alternate timelines even occasionally manage proper simple story arcsif trying completionist getting everything become annoying times wish enjoy silly animations situations joy go sadly technical perspective also great possibly due flash roots im sure games still running version feels like annoying issues example high resolution monitor game launch rather small window according
