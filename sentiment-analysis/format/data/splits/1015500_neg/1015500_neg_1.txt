pieces wrestlers put together multiple themes misnamed others completely missing also create title supposedly patched named date thats general issues story mode sad state affairs mouths dont move people speaking male protagonist made look like idiot female generic want wrestler real motivation create wrestler items locked behind towers beating game harder difficulties change button layouts crosses menus makes sense recommend anyone buy game return get refund immediately latest patch least doesnt crash time one crash h played even trying show replay graphics looks mostly great geforce gtx intel core ghz processor ultrawide resolution game rarely lags anymore even pressing interrupt doable usual theres great roster expandable via user made contributions quite impressive aint bad allbut couldve better say really bad frame rate horrible least worse ive come decision never purchase wwe game idk got sports games im nintendo indie person heard since games launch negative things seen video footage back uphowever since recent patch seems patched many game breaking bugs many cosmetic glitches things alike decided get game based patch notes experienced single crash game breaking bug occasional weird physics moment ring nothing crazy doesnt happen ofteni entirely enjoyable experience game plenty plenty grind interesting modes showcase great career fun far bit meme fest cant wait dig universe modethe creation suite massive create everything superstar belts shows entrances videos etc theres lot honestly say majority peoples issues ironed models still look bit odd spoton accurate would recommend game wwe fan also people complained new control scheme bad similar bit changed got used immediately play good dont put negative reviews accurate time anymore cool wrestlers also reversals seemed fixed previous versions trouble reversing moves almost year wwe came usthere still many bugs wwe fanjust dont waste money shit game amazing steam experienced mild bugs major inconveniences glitches awful game complete downgrade previous wrestling games aspects unbelievable train wreck gamei cannot believe allowed releasedim dumb mark buying game dont expect second game fixed apart janky controls one worst looking games ever seen character models environments look worse games made years ago load times takes seconds move one screen next asshole making buying world already thousands reviews saying shitty answer apparently little updates broken mess hope fun glitches ultimately ruin experience whole need wrestling fix go overall better game mod wrestlers game much many lets say countless countless bugs horrible game still somewhat playable certain extenddrop framerate poor animation cheap character models even game crashes turn blind eye game keeps resetting time quit play cross line unlocking dlc characters find need unlock silly challenges wasting time devs please fix also every bug plaguing game first rather annoyed quality fact game kept crashing adding files buying bump night dlc game runs much smoother saying recommend game alright game u get bad graphics game forces create play female character bad lip sync hard af beating hell dudes still fun get enjoyment game cant make amount times crashes awful frame drops two dudes fight ring ask really dont know mess playing wrestling games years since smackdown shut mouth played wwe games easily worst one never game crash many times almost spots character creation taken step backwards overall game lack luster another copy paste last year somehow worse bottom line dont even waste damn money rubbish game wwe games come mess game controls damn slow mocaps thought going route realism would realistic fun seriously game absolute garbage play gameplay literally goddamn awful decided write bad review rubbish excuse game theres still graphical glitches games well known reversals still terrible unpredictable window press triangle depending controller gameplay fourhorsewomen absolutely unplayable damn slow doesnt feel fun play whose idea slower gameplay sports games may okay kind game picking downed opponent feels slow af takes least seconds pick damn opponent downed position standing groggy position ridiculous compare gameplay hctp sd vs rw games onwards feels way damn slow clunky hell targeting system doesnt even exist even though listed game doesnt anything playing way match ridiculous compared earlier wwe games era probably one worst wwe games series sorry go one worst series could enjoy game game mechanics wasnt bad unfortunately isnt one worst wwe games ever played entire life thing enjoyed game myplayer career mode even though little cheesy still enjoyed poor gameplay mechanics wanted watch next cutscene skip actual gameplay thats bad actual gameplay thought people joking downgrade graphics game werent joking graphics look like era graphics wrestlers look terrible look nothing like counterparts commentary still terrible times im one move commentary calls completely different move like wtf
