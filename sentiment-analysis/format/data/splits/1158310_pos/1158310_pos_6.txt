thecraziest historic scenarios lot ways play game know definite goal define goals despite paradox game fairly easy get mechanics probably change later dlc content moment perfect people new series like one downside game prone crashing machine great sequel building blocks game even better long run second passes less fleshedout features meantime theres plenty get done great sequel previous game lots new features definitely recommend really fun play great start next entry crusader kings faith system really easy customize religion need time events like previous game great time waster entirely satisfyingthe combat clunky large aspect game essentially need position army correctly make sure well supplied try fight correct terrain troopsif like never ending drudgery rp game fun potentially lot sense morph nation based religion culture options develop cultures see fit however would take literally hundreds hours game achieve edit character creation really allows speed process big plus feel game slightly lacking goals missions rp really nothing terms game mechanics achieve next hierarchical rank conquer mapall recommended fun strategy game ive played much better imo great upgrade previous great visuals little bit casual thats like even moresoundtrack great lot less janky experience like lot like better looking ui graphics well easier accesibillity lot like crusader kings

incredibly improved crusader kings might favorite new feature game way interacts realm laws warfare economy cultural regional ideas makes learning viable path specialize family midgamegame excellent someone hours paradox game theres steep learning curve lot fun either way pretty good game still victoria pretty neato game really cool game although never liked really fun really fun game great sequel amazing game crusader kings ii fact byzantine empire decided take france one day game sweden took considered modern day portugal really funny amazing mecannot wait dlc lol really good game ton content play long enough like paradox title youll come conclusion could use little seasoninghowever compared paradox titles launch one staggeringly good going age like fine wine like crusader kings ii updates supplement along dlc probably make game ages holds better crusader kings ii definitely game decade really good strategy game refinement formula really fun play could use work areas events compared launch actually feels like really great game im excited see evolves next adding ruler designer really good decision role playing game pretending kingdom builder works youll fun making

play eat free time alive always joy beat poor yo child king always difficult review paradox game theyre always released deliberately unfinished state dizzying number dlcs patches paradox games always worksinprogress day studio pulls plug usually successor arrivesso far however crusader kings iii seems worthy successor crusader kings ii ended alltime great strategy game always fun find ways consolidate power gamescheming conquering arranging marriages sorry children werent player heir met untimely end result unfortunate accidents amazing amazing alright game good even base content bnegativesb music pretty dull really nothing add immersion invading large swathes land better technology tied cultures regardless countieskingdomsempires probably one stupidest design decisions made one teh great things could actually invest kingdom using gold build technology buildings develop character high learning skill use spy master steal tech points less control either passively wait use one subjects add development county ill add like theyve added development game think restricting technology cultures really bad inflexible thing doi personally think county county basis like men arms arbitrarily limited men arms capacity primarily based actually afford could also implement feature state blacksmiths types infrastructure need constructed maintained allow standardised armour weapons could unlocked techs allowed earlier certain empires eg byzantines standardised armies compared western counterparts features could added support logistics etc include sliders improve capacity certain things armourweapon maintenance fortification maintenance logistics patrols etc give us control domain feel like laws lacking game compared would nice fleshed feel byzantines especially need separate feudal kingdoms west pretty different system considering remnants roman empire immortal event come way events needed heck could even copy paste starting point really reason use add new ones along dont like small amount construction slots give us construction slots even buildings choose perhaps add county population tie population also influence many levies pop keep going war taking huge losses drag economy decades etc would really help add depth game add bit grand strategy game cant collect treasures join societies like fun added bit depth game bring back improve dont cut creating subject kingdoms isnt thing game far see quite enjoyed setting tributaries nonincorporated subjects bpositive featuresb men arms system pretty nice like raise professional soldiers similar feature like theyve done control designing professional army dynasty attributes great addition ive set eugenics program get really good heirs related note would good future fleshed eugenics side feel actually quite significant part game considering character make break game religion system slight improvement added talent tree huge improvement character development overall decent game missing lot stuff enjoyed hopefully updates come bring quality higher bscore base game b amazing game like strategy politics aspects grand strategies combat complicated seems game explains everything fairly well amazingly satisfying feeling slowly keep building realm especially start small starting powerful dynasties nothing feels like great accomplishment awesome game lot hours price easy game start small scale intricate master fun discover special tricks accomplish goals improvement every way user friendly interface less pointless micromanagement much deeper rpg mechanics absolutely gorgeous graphically

great way say early crusades still strong also easy put dynasty throne ive gone crusades top contributer one secondthe new systems renown fame faith pretty awesome havent gotten around making faith incredibly detailed much holy fury reformation system cant wait try good enough game recommend due numerous flaws issues ive decided hold playing longer least first dlc released everything buggyas example spend huge amount time wars various reasons dont stand chance even easy win allied armies often sit frozen spot directly adjacent enemy armies could easily eradicate get stuck flipflopping two different moves get stuck endless cycle faction war every time beat instantly pops end war zero targets besiege enemy armies never possibly win things like hugely problematic similar issues lines succession changing percievable reasons flipflopping heirs narratives repeat endlessly nothing like getting new dog every months reason forth made mistake transitioning tribal feudal turns wipes literally everything youve achieved point rendering game totally unplayable point forwardsthe core premise entertaining roleplaying aspect maintaining lineage titles great mess moment kind fun sure

laggy ai seems completely clueless rarely king stat top paradoxs launcher working computers homea lot people seem love guess good game writing review people feel like know theyre ones first time ck series really fun fari would like make suggestion would nice war table sorts example ally summon defend attacker ally got like soldiers attacker soldiers get soldiers could crush army power already accounted arrive ally keep moving little enemy settlements siege attacker goes main city wins war wellll although know could command ally army would nice war table sorts decide best strategy defense attack happens called ally even come oftens happens despite confirmed coming another use war table would long wars could deliberate orders minor divisions army like siege town enconter enemy army larger run idk let know decide hoping publishers see dsorry bad english best wishes nice king conquer lands foes overly buggy paradox development studio brings sequel one popular strategy games ever made new king historical strategy igncrusader kings game year vg crusader kings pc gamer title complex title quite nice well polished seems getting active attention worth buy imo cool thats alright bad successor ive got something like hrs bugs mainly inconsistent tooltips etc prestige hate crashing game reason overall smooth plays pretty well ui takes getting used thats paradox yougameplaywise bloody difficult without real stroke luck typical ironman game starting count level see absolutely decimated within years stronger neighbours virtually impossible deal goldprestigepiety accrues slowly almost forget theyre little easier finesse social interaction feel especially capabilities game limited us straight yesno decisions straightforward things like trying negotiate betrothal bit disappointing also acceptance scores negotiate pants someone released prison cant convince friendly allied count accept betrothal kids come whats point charismatic negotiator im still limited automatically generated acceptance scores way underdeveloped peace negotiations compared something like ive conquered every province character owns imprisoned damn straight im going want take county declared prestige bump barely covers cost declaring first placethere features wish could hype baronies serve practical function game tell cant raid cant give except special circumstances middle ages cmon guys baronies able awarded loyal knights thats baronies knights get theyre add another dynamic combat get combat isnt game hell lot knightschampions system opinion replaced commanders approval bump named characters thats even social end theres seven swaggering knights dozen young maids court wheres scandalreligion works well traitslifestyles system easily games best features game works enjoyable feels little like corners cut hit release date likely features knowingly halfcocked allow future dlc paradox games acquired taste liked youll find similar perhaps similar better graphics new game familiar theme perfect kinks worked mechanically primogeniture super lategame elective succession weird etc performance could better frequent slowdown though type game really noticeable without framecounter freezing less forgiveable despite however crusader kings managed crusader kings never could turn somebody watched long game short videos thought fun would could grok game somebody could actually enjoy series tutorial great new layout great models characters slowly ageing reacting environments great weird random story chains great except bug sometimes occasionally found completely empty text box character scandalized wife sleeping overall great still dont think perfect game everyone lack real goal mixed depth complexity means people probably arent going love game love complex systems fun grapple try master deep seated love history like always wanted get crusader kings kept bouncing unintuitive interface systems worth time matter many times nearly aneurysm king france wont friggin honor alliance perfect heir homosexual dies without son keep coming back deserves praise gets perfect theres issues ally army ai biggest one top head feels like natural progression crusader kings format devs still know audience theres host improvements least performance well lot additions tweaksmy favourite guess stress system forcing path based characters traits highly encouraging penalties acting system really lends building character person head ok somebody isnt keeps getting wife prego thoalso sons keep getting murdered reason better rest okay time wish bit feel like large map size availability move around limited feel like games paradox games better empire feels unstable suppose part could get better wars feel fun need learn siege fasteredit siege things faster siege weapons things better okay actually pretty good far easy expand realm lowly vassal needs far complexity generating claims expansion front started count hard became king one lifetime without much save scum list trade would nice closest allies rally points need configurable least youre setting one tell local levy value would edit see local levies sometimes force large enough list sorting header

changing systems ways make sense game far far better simple shell finished dlc terrific base game well worth price asis though truly incredible see game look like couple years updates dlcthe ui looking good would say still weakest area one thing much less clear factions strong factions doesnt take much zooming cant see counties found little disorienting weirdest bizarre issue often hard see county enemy unit one point seemed one four different counties depending zoom level scrolled find fifth county help either tooltips longer list name units location fun especially online friends

cant even survive king ive played classic paradox games far best launch ever many improvement keeping true grand strategy beautiful masterpiece iz good mang im huge fan crusader kings ii played many years crusader kings iii nice upgrade franchise new graphics amazing ckiii seems much polished ckii several levelshowever die hard fan ckii used mechanics ckii new game seem little jarring times definitely plays differently ckiisuccesion laws changed historically accurate means going stuck worse system gavelkind least four five generations longeragain much historically accurate frustrating old school ckii players used using tricks rush primogeniture succesion safe secure blobbing experienceit take getting used definitely like done far loved ckii art style man new ckiii art really beautiful nice workalso ckiii content ckii ckii like major expansions things get better paradox adds new content expansions next years ive played hours far everything hoped managed keep game complicated also accessible new players much much much better tutorial everything great quality improvement love army spawns one place rather kingdom kept many old game mechanics balanced new ones put place far complaints game havent seen way find many people character killed amazing game highly recommend ive spent entirely much time playing game last weeks today finally broken hold addictive beautifully crafted masterpiece grand strategy havent lost days like since civilization first played whilst reading wikipedia side screen create custom empires religions try play alternative histories amazing paradox blended role playing elements grand strategy brilliant way two campaigns play similarly ive started haesteinn lowly count ridiculous martial skills sometimes able make strategic alliances marrying children end kingdom twenty years times children die midway war crippling alliance structure end landless vagabond amount timehighly recommend jesus christ someone fix ai crusade im begging christian kingdoms sit friendly territory wait lose miracle decide go siege stuff let muslim armies form large groups stay divided tiny armies get crushed like bruh know crusades dont go well catholic kingdoms cmon half time pope sends armies back home reason huge fun need say anyone liked love one ck better incest beautiful paradox game like always better opinion better version one greatest games time could love giant f anyone like sunk way much get amazing good game great game option view wars empire like vasall fights one great game great game dont know else say new crusader kings new features upgraded graphics good far ive enjoying really good game like solid fun impressive grand strategy title minor rpg elements thrown mix around wonderful paradoxs best release yet amazing amazing amazing amazing worthy successor franchise amazing single game since wow back new got hooked like level freedom choice staggering really really good game around great game amazing lacking gameplay additions however gameplay additions doesnt also gameplay parts lacking im sure become much better future updatesdlc etc recent ruler designer update absolutely stellar design much better onei would highly recommend game grand strategy fans addictive bit simplified bit bare bones present confidence even better good expansions already quite improved game many waysits honestly bit easy youre veteran want challenge pretty much manufacture one intentionally putting bad position lots sons controlling succession etc never played probably wont affect first fact youll probably hugely overwhelmed first dozen hours like us first time played ck gamemany things dont like realism wise still present also maybe even example seen tibetan buddhists inherit territory central france king sweden vassals suddenly convert islam byzantine emperor randomly convert coptic marry ethiopian obscure nudist heretical sect called adamites spreading like wildfire amongst european nobility etc understand sort thing much charm game people things like rapidly ruin immersion id like see game options rectify us prefer realistic historically plausible game options greater penalty marriage acceptance vastly different culture groups along vassals becoming much less accepting liege converting new religion would start least crusader kings arent immediately converting islam soon crusade anymoreall said love game highly recommend look forward wasting profane amount life coming years like fun easier learn ck ii good little user friendly ckii much intrigue scheming less inexplicable loss titles inheritance crises still plenty inheritance crises explicable good good good predecessor nice gameplay tweaks bad new allied troops ai cant assign command movement garbage sometimes get stuck moving tiles entire fking war good reviews good second major dlcs features brought incorporated base game anyhow secret societies arent thing yet still absolutely worth good say good better first one everything intuitive graphics improved significantly cant wait dlc great bit lacking features confidence dev teamedit far first big free update seems promising indepth previous edition much
