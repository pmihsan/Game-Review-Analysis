click around find youre looking rather intimidating new players regardless youre always learning something new game playsreligious flavour id like see differences religions forming changing aspects traits within play sort par id like option switch incorporate different religions might im playing african nation though love absolute spectrum available religions regardless character interactions dont get wrong theres plenty think options would introduce little intimacy rather generic actions used bad thing simply personal outlook itgeneral flavour far ive noticed possessed doesnt really affect game moment maybe character sweetheart cancels havent noticed specifically possessed interactions example also noticed general events varangian guard one comes mind mass conversion denmark another example havent really paid much attention diaries know theyre bringing features line theyve polished ruler designer also believe artifactstreasure iirc tldr blast definitely sandbox think could use flavour cant inherently say theres anything dislike game save ui clunky far best class youve played medieval era grand strategy game youve played crusader kingsthis game third iteration

two completely different dynasties sharing name making extremely difficult keep track one slightly less counties largely offset way counties divided individual baronies map way create new barony slots
