holy shit actually good didnt think one favorite games time could incredibly improved really modernized best ways ui graphics overhauls super nice course also things like opening singleplayer games multiplayer switching characters much without even discussing gameplay changes understand peoples issues levy especially boat simplification fan bringing troops together boat system less pain even less realistic biggest issues arent really big notably hooks secrets system seems bit glitchy needs options starting periods definitely biggest desire dlc starting periods im positive coming considering paradox operates overall game makes hundreds dollars dlc look ancient restored roman empire ironman save game almost restore imperial provinces except duchy normandy kingdom england duchies spain tried restore duchies spain game stopped working auto save save file corrupted got hot headed awhile thats fine game amazing really good experience restoring roman empire old border im little bit sad couldnt make justinians dream come true restore whole western empire im recommend anyone read try game game amazing love itroma invicta far zero complaints game detail sheer amount counts dukes kingdoms play personalities really intrigues also game play user friendly compared games similar subject matter impressed political aspects well random events decisions make keep engaged first game started lowly count hre played dynasty generations unfortunate quite disgusting events occurred still kind interesting even possible enemy takes holdings worry probably get back oh liege

multilayered several wellfleshed playstyles viable win though youll need mix succeedmy first hours consisted around failed games highly recommend watching several howto videos immediately completing tutorial great new version crusader kings game incest complex development enjoy game thoroughly enjoyed welli started count possessed single greek province byzantine empire began taking provinces greece afterwards got lucky gained province middle east one northern africa somehow turned capturing lands heathens without clothes caucusus ended whole levant caucusus region greece big chunk north africa none connected map creating extreme border gore realized much explore independent ruler leading declare independence pitiful resistance went change everything liking defeating former liege numerous times war kicking already great game editor recently added looking forward play die kids die lose time years retake lands reclaim throne family healthy many wars kids alive happy collapse must round corner never really fan strategic video games however great game cannot stop playing also easier understand mechanics game previous paradox games lots fun great improvement great game hard

absolute masterpiece even whether fan ckii like completely new player enjoy game beware humour get dark game hours completed half game already done everything fun dockiii hours still playing tutorial learnt play good overall recommend game play issues list later update things change gain experience playing game runs smooth constant havent encountered major minor technical glitches map style really good looking art pov game looks great music direction great ui smooth mostly fine feels bit engaged overall clunky boxes nothing gamebreaking like religious systems hook system lifestyle system bit bland would liked see ambitions still part game combat nice overall much clearerbig problems biggest gripe level detail contained game compared whilst counties divided subsequent baronies bishoprics etc bigger playable scale detail reduced despite advertising map much higher detail doesnt translate well gameplay example playing count lancashire possible could start small make moves develop nope play duke mercia controls large portion england option play count less counts overall less opportunities play rise power pov many big named starts map modes get overlooked options main default terrainrealm view really diplomatic map example opinion map reduction detail cb claims cb claims far easy acquire oftentimes could waiting ages fabricate push claim pushed extreme wait timer ping bam also problems random claims coming often eg ireland every chief claim timer gameplay feels almost bit like mobilegame number timers present whether fabricating swaying etc still chance based often feel like im simply waiting clock run character finder nerfed totally whilst reasons make sense terms historical accuracydistance rulers actual interface butchered instead able search people invite court efficient way reliant guests turning court right skills lest council member dies want improve things issue arrange marriage options feels like paradox simply ruined system nothing solid put place hook system feels like lot reductions parts game way shoehorn new intrigue mechanics end feeling tedious essentially thing go character getting want small annoyances selecting character play option reselect date game rules screen without going back main menuloading deleting saves timers decisions seem long less available option save game rule preferencesprofiles change every time start new game ui sometimes annoying going several menus find something want something else click start entirely eg character finder tips following silly reviewwith tutorial king conquered ireland game seems go deeper local culturecustoms stuff instituted old irish succession law united kingdom wouldnt break died law elective tanistry vassals vote member dynasty heir get votes dukes get think votes vassals votethe problem vassals voted distant cousin didnt even know existed nobody lived galloway britain son work take ireland elect little farqwad looking punk tried assassinate failed leader big dumb brute intriguethen decided say screw ill invade galloway take imprison kill courtier county caught crossfireas soon win war character dies stress smug looking prick dominates screen continue heirits fun even begin playing go settings change tool tip lock delay time default seconds feels awkward set secondsthis means hover tooltip x amount time itll lock instead going away move mouse away also set locks hit button like middle button mouse default isnt good consider lowering gui feel like ui like general little big think feels better warned text small vision issues might good change actual game knightschampionsfaris important part court combat default courtiers vassals highest combat prowess fielded knights control however military knights dont want important councilor die forbid fielding knight also use kill annoying courtier cull heirs dont want clicking force meaning theyll fielded takes prowess account likely die especially prowess declaring war war objective changed click conquer duchycountyetc itll default one change target clicking change objective youve clicked declare war type want missed longest time seems like noduh tip forts terrain causing attrition actually really helpful hurtful attrition seems powerful especially close match ups keep eye youve got area seems natural path attack foes consider building manatarms match ups insanely powerful youve got counter units swing way numbers keep eye holdings boost manatarms well even puny light footmen basically suck throw huge wrench effectiveness heavy infantry youre fighting someone uses hire immediately ill keep updating come across inbreeding simulator best game better graphics improved ai edit hours less fixed combat definitely recommend game good stuffcombat used fun patch changed previously allied forces wouldnt help battles generally took initiative capture castles apparently complaints would lead situations couldnt easily attack army outnumbered main force even tens thousands allied troops area however much worse allied units follow around generally hang back youre lucky might seize nearby castle time trail behind getting fight youve already lost allied units follow far behind time engage enemy theyll wait battle completed youve lost theyll throw enemy win lose forces occasionally dont seem know walking back forth cities though theyre glitching hours hours
