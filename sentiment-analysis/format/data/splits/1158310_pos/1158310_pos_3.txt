empire fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun even get annihilated fun game like genre developers works fun game really enjoy fun game simplified bit approachable new players would recommend fans grand strategy games fun game play little bit harder beginning without tutorial dont tutorials p yes fun game probably gonna playing fun game confusing controls fun time become used fun game plenty nuance sometimes get screwed lose motivation start perhaps thats recommend overall good times fun game bit arcady lacking role playing aspects much better friends fun game didnt expect less played good made better fun game good perfect tutorial complex game fun game good foundation looking forward updates fun game perfect getting taking want weaker say always better want go seize want heathens blessings church upon fun game graphics ui better ever theyve tried take best parts streamline worked gameplay crisp addictinginstant classic looking forward dlcs fun game liked youll like game new game also acessible fun game crazy things middle ages game still bugs need patched still alot fun fun grand strategy game cleans modernizes genre pretty nicely much approachable said game feels like needs dlc patches fully featured youre new genre series fantastic place start youre veteran might feel like missing stuff youre paradox fan probably already knew expect fun kingdom management simulator youve ever watched cgp grey videos rules rulers death dynasty youve got idea expect start guess whoever pick youre charge dynasty plot land rule someones vassal someone one vassals vassals land want live youre going need keep happy though knights sisters brothers mayors moms guys idiot heir whos done nothing earn thrown need dealt game expansion well need build structures better lands youll also want expand lands goto war need reason could form rightful claim like da king norf could bishop come bs call legit cares current owners probably illegitimate anyway take lands rightfully youll need army get army need peasants gold peasants levies make army free tell gather torches pitchforks send die righteous death raise maintain trained army menatarms well unit involved sensible rockpaperscissors scheme however need right also hire mercenaries groups menatarms levies knightsspeaking knights everyones knight potentially well everyone anyway youll see armies fighting along side mayors actual knights heirs want killed etc also option let people knights vassals hates happens die war stump lose theres still lot game take bit investment get spent watching tutorials first spent hours ingame tutorial hour tutorial gives info lets keep playing pretty fun whole time theres lot learn watch tips videos youll get gist need tutorial ingame tutorial good job helping popup system looking terms fantastic standard complex game really makes things manageable fun strategic sandbox rpg play however want turned debug mode made pope girl stats every positive trait game changed different character watch ultrapope mathilde thing afar fun play first playthrough early mid game completely shallow boring end game empire levies expecting grand strategy sold worth price fun little bare coming many years development lot pleasant entertaining changes well way life style components focuses miss secret societies though fun easier great game nonetheless fun easier learn ckii nearly full featured early shows lots promise already good dlc fun probaly best word use describe game dense intens first glance worth getting fun nothing like discovering son porking wife throw em dungeon good ol crusaider kings lol fun visually pleasing works charm without major fps drops like old one great game bright future paradox gets high horse stop like sims comes dlc gj pi youve succeeded making already amazing game even better game feels like rpg predecessor still grand strategy feel id highly recommend game tbh really like pi developer whole gg goodimmersive roleplay experience start famous historical generals go way characters mixture wardiplomacydeveloping country control fastslow want time pass choices make actually matter traitsskills effect characters reaction choices make changing fate worldbadthe tutorial covers basics dlc cant bought without either getting deluxe edition paying whole usd pass wars arent fun things cant get steam achievements without playing one specific set rules probably need watch hours youtube videos know mechanics game literally get pregnantget people pregnant outside control current character outside marriage really hard play easiest campaigns wars way complicated start without claims buggy times alliances usually crumble right whoever made marriage agreement dies even child married heirs younger siblingdespite overwhelmingly bad things game fact put lot time outside want get good become somewhat fun havent campaign yet despite hours modded runs playing game rules need use get achievements cant say regret purchase though dlc pack mostly expensive clothes characters bit ridiculous looking plans hope first two expansions worth though remains seen goty ask massive improvement predecessor strong game right streamlines lot complicated issues previous games series game crashes alot working almost month paradox doesnt best support staff game gud ezzzzz cus god game came hours spent pls send help game concepts little esoteric fun tutorials dont provide enough guidance game depth maybe played first two installments learning curve great game cool yes game crashes every time try load save year later physically cant get past year game crashes repeatedly lacks basic functionality like key remapping enforces unreasonable rules discord server make impossible access technical support game poor job teaching basics probably good game u know play previous versions new player frustrating game feels empty areas alllack rulers many choices especially counties since us prefer humble beginning storymods solve issues cases even adding nice things overall id suggest waiting sale next year least one two three dlcs game feels much faster ui processing simulator ai decoupled lot polished qol went game however game feels bit sparse meat going come along dlcs pretty fun base game already still feels bit depth perhaps features arent coming abstraction feels different good way gameplay might feel bit shoehorned roleplaying characters traits game gets better iteration plot scheme either growth family watch crumble around game good game good game good game good game high learning curve prepared learn ropes game genre strategy rpg mechanics market niche unlike aaa game developers focus entirely favor month eg fps battle royals genre caters mostly mass sheepsgame without faults ui pretty messy since game mechanics functions complex icons show hierarchy tree structure help visually differential title levels combat feels clunky could merged warband battle game would epic combat system simplisticwould recommend u time energy spend learning game mechanicsits buy even better discount get game week dont think time consuming game like preordered game im big paradox fanboy especially hearts iron really recommend game anyone even arent history nerd like unlike game requires little nothing historical knowledge time peroid also play family type game play country leads lot fun mean loads fun ever thought making naked imbred empire look game made craic although yet try play mp could imagine laughs fun come thisi would highly recommend game anyone would give game improved little since release still good opioion believe get game content cheaper cool new mechanics also improved graphics engine game solid bones game great potential knowing paradox playing many assorted dlc years come game amazing many different ways play best imaginations run wild game amazing vanilla game amazing certainly par current day game truly stands tutorial unlike pdx grand strategy game ckiii actually tells play game true tutorial game extremely complicated even fans modern strategy games tutorial helpful covers high level basics game doesnt adequately prepare rest found overwhelming intimidating even playing easy campaigns scenarios youre sort thing game definitely average casual gamer though game fantastic grand strategy many ways play many possible outcomes game fun guess game fun needs soul game good game good game good fun first seen majority events game doesnt feel new anymore however take long time get point well worth money hope dlc adds variety gamelater actually realizing learned lot game apply history lineages kingdoms empires lot things make lot sense historical context even fiction like like witcher books basically lot kingdom title issues game good far things cheesed cant quite give example doesnt feel depth however still really good game worth buy imo game good like probably love game though stick playing think lacks things though im pretty sure game starts getting dlc might become good even better currently lacks stuff pretty sure updates dlc rectified launch two different things game good tutorial much better however mechanics still poorly explainedbut really needs custom character creator badly game great worth buywell done paradox game great worth price despite upcoming dlc important caveat keep mind though rather thinking strategy game like hoi current iteration much vassalliege relations rping rulers traits expect less monolithic state experience better playing strategy gamesmy experience far rather small realms id guess managing larger realm going lot work instead simply map paintinggranting viceroyalties besides lot modularity base game much interested mods going getas addendum super happy religionheresy changes really great stuff game great far compared crusader kings ii would say game easier use newer players get tutorial worlds playing count duke king emperor building kingdomempire game one game mode really play dynasty dies play end year usually quit accomplished goals set character great new game actually good base paradox game definitely gonna hold standard game game state less features understandable considering received years dlc work expect features including nomads republics china pretty much everything existed beforeother game incredibly good feeling late game events like mongols black death wary thattldr want features waitedit added late game features nothing extravagant great see genghis khan isnt much threat time starts compared powers year especially mongol cultural advances game incredible ive shied away grand strategy games past one seemed approachable game shit buy trust game fun good like paradox grand strategy game love second least overwhelming one played imo isnt easy play easy learn ropes new grand strategy games want give try buy one complicated dlcs brand new easy understand ui great around game released usual due dlc policy paradox game feels plain compared makes lot promise couple dlc updates believe better prefer playing game looks sounds really pretty addictive gameplay immense replay value everyone able set goals enjoy sandbox style gameplay enjoy historical setting game looks nice character portraits characters hair sticking helmets arms go chest cage facepalm still century video game development experience graphics behind character portraits static even simple card game developers make cards move video game priced euro would ask refund could next issueso far none commander traits work game nonereaver noorganizer edit worksmilitary engineer nounyielding defender keep mind game politics largest part done war conquest game much fun game thrones would murder brother sweet sweet kingdom game thrones better game year pc far im concerned level ups already excellent game puts place solid foundation grow take paradox grand strategy new heights game year said hours game play played even say favorite game steam time game play hard make lot less gold need upkeep armies pay people like ruler dies talk pure chaos every one thinks rule money makes whole game cant make enough keep get want play game without trying secure land keep long large faction isnt baring fun sure like want achieve something good luck maybe watch lots videos find sort thing cheating good luck play game win least achieve sort goal game play somewhat shallow moment still awesome game little negative things said would recommend waiting dlc start coming buying however game pretty fun like release ruler designer game still crashes way much cant go minutes without ctd also balance way whack
