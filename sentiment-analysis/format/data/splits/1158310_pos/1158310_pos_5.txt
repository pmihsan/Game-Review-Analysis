ui overhaul pretty intuitive addition tooltips hover something didnt realise sorely missing much friendlier game overall visuals lovely performance improved play late game crusades tons units board without game stuttering every seconds plus monthly saves actually doable instead playing minutes waiting save complete another minutes theyve packed lot new skill trees neat gives sense progress characters think lacking previous game much character development random whereas feel like guide kings queens efficiently add ruler editor enhanced genetics feel like im actively building ruling family get attached dynasty trees legacies flesh nicely cultures new religion panel system neat little change cant say miss old technology system even hundreds hours cant say fully understood old tech system cultural system still seems bit odd real modifier highlearning ruler least preferred ruler play style result always lag behind tech department like somewhat forces development whole map line also pretty big detriment certain play styles real benefit balance think part needs work maybe adding cultural focuses change advances cultural tech eg culture idolises war ruler high martial advance cultural developments instead learning especially concerning war buildings troop advancementsthere areas dire need improvement theres excuse horrible ai crusades awful saying something given name game allies actively spread take everything objective theyll stake holding men right next enemy stack wipes army gotten bit better patches still actively avoid joining crusades unless know singlehandedly win dlcs flesh lot missing bits ive come complete version vanilla events well vanilla hope one first dlc bring implements societies huge part gameplay currently closest thing scratches itch witch playthrough isnt cutting overall good game great game serious potential favourite years come paradox took good game stripped bulky confusing polished timesink thats fun play solo friends learning

revenge stupid amount fun almost feel confident enough start playing ironman difficultythe issues tab helpful guiding new players figuring redesigned ui feels lot intuitive personally someone couldnt figure still need wiki open second monitor thats par course game thats knowledge intensive also numbers details screen much easier readparse nice like able see im without switching different pair glasses sitting two inches screen positive changesif youve never played crusader kings youve always interested playing never made leap time make plunge terms hours enjoyment vs cost hands best purchase ive made steam might even buy dlc tried play started late couldnt interact game good highly recommend tried start playing several times every time hard understand eventually gave mostly playing imperator rome supposedly less featuresbut game different much much friendlier way better interface predecessor got hooked almost immediately monday working day starts minutes didnt sleep yetsurely theres things could improved high hopes expansionsoh also check loverslab already neat mods truly enjoy wonderful game visuals amazing game allows endless hours fun turned europe cannibalistic orgy loving jewish religion united ireland took scotland age fifty years growing single county great kingdom fought several invasions raised children continue succession specialty died right feast old age whats first thing youngest son isaac rebels chosen successor causes kingdom ireland fall chaos loyalists separatists picked apart northmen sons rule duchys counties many died eldest son affair youngests best generated story telling game united ireland seized iceland joined crusade jerusalem entirely funded blackmailing englishits actually approachable fantastic united scandinavian empire reformed norse religion basically viking caliphateif thats fun dont know usually dont like strategie games games like fun game serie usually really get games like however felt game little bland really surprising considering price tag positive reviews perhaps missing something game play price tag would recommend game much wanted get dense didnt time figure everything able get trial game pass try one absolutely amazing bought game steam week ive engrossed game well ever tried take map fun ive found really enjoy actually roleplaying character characters alive heir takes strategy shift fit new rulers personality starting ruler diplomat run around trying befriend neighboring rulers making alliances heir intrigue based switch gears start plotting backstabbing rulers like liked mom much much fun youve intimidated crusader kings past definitely give shot want dlcs want achievementsi want relicsinventoryi want smarter ai preserve familiesdynastieshouses deleted female heir marries another housei want knights interaction etci want interesting characters dates start want able recommend current state many issues game irk enough able recommend however certainly great potential game future didnt buy soon launch would instead preferred buy would sale want like game never grabs hand pulls tried playing one kingdomempirewhatever basically game events run real quick nothing new experience want like game depth seems really fun however learning curve pretty harsh tutorial helps started new game felt lost time like deep strategy look elsewherechecksum issues make impossible play multiplayer want love game builds beautifully years turns lags point longer playable pc specs least double recommended value run game yet quickly becomes massive resource hog even applications closed moment exit pc absolutely fine im sure game issues running much older pc im surprised id need absolute beast gaming unit handle none graphic intensive game frustrating wanted get crusader kings entry barrier felt strong make enjoyable feel really solved made easy get still maintains gameplay feels deep warning though might get addicted meth wanted like really didultimately strategy game ftlmeetssims rng rules everything hours work undone seconds zero recourse wanted like game really even playing hours straight still idea play correctly tutorial didnt help im probably patient enough try understand deeply aspects game slow boring even difficult huge surprise played civ wasnt bad game wrecks right start im dedicated enough go read guides wanted like game fun wife cheated brother within ten minutes new mechanics like proper feudalism cool polished graphics great lot variety including traits perks even affecting characters posebut samey honestly give recommend disappointment hype train doesnt help wanted play moment got pc disappointment great part wanted start first campaign simple focus creating perfect utopian kingdom perfect genetically bred ruler began journey eugenics sought potential partner ruler desirable genetics eventually found one started pumping potential heirs kingdom one genetics looking appearedafter succeeded plan getting desired heir realize late consequences actions chosen heir last line due current succession lack foresight deal rulers children heavy heart committed one greatest crimes future kingdomi started game dreams utopian kingdom good honest intentions becoming corrupted ruler slowly becoming depraved wanted wait enough hours close trying draw conclusions think thats important paradox games generally extremely complex takes time really appreciate understand mechanics ultimately decided give game negative review case decision particularly difficult actually good game unfortunately isnt good predecessor know people would prefer judge game merits isnt really fair accurate builds attempts improve review needs consider whether paradox accomplished goal view notso get right lot things game runs amazingly well close hours play never encountered single crash hesitation stutter anything else resembling technical problem bug noticed wellreported situation levies sometimes fail fill completely im sure paradox fix one minor balance issues gifts raise opinion cost two three years worth income small realm none things gamebreaking certainly arent surprising newly released game also like improvements intrigue system dozens plots existence point time chance success would stay effect decades intended victim eventually died old age graphics game look great map looks nice people look like real people particularly barbershop tool lets customize characters appearance like fact press anyones claim dont landed first always struck odd someone vassal could make vassal paradox go wrong word depth game looks good surface longer play realize something missing got handle new mechanics soon began feel like playing game lite examplesthe real purpose served council give people reason negative modifier long members least opinion really dont care often needed use favors get council members support law changes even go war members basically love dumb game historically realisticin expanding usually meant finding people claims could press targeted counties expansion usually goal establishing duchieskingdomsempires found people claims counties tried entice court could press claims spend ridiculous amount prestige invite random claimants court eventually random claimants claims random counties show people generally claims counties hundred miles border middle another realm absolutely strategic interest hours game realize doesnt really matter easy forge claims really dont need claimants allthe intrigue system sounds good surface realize aside assassination revolves mostly around hooks problem hooks essentially worthless hours play ive probably used example find one knights cannibal arrest fiend head right uh cant reveal know blackmail hook unlanded character money power exactly supposed hook example find wife affair heir throne probably isnt really heir common would surprised child realm living biological father time arrest appeal pope divorce right yep blackmail supposed hook force serve breakfast bedthere many issues ive already made long point almost everything game dumbeddown simplified point longer interesting challenging im big paradox fan spent far life playing games would like admit missed mark one dont think bit complex probably enjoy enjoy suggest continue playing gets little work eventually huge fan crusader kings took several years overcome learning curve fully understand comparison third entry polished approachable paradox game yet highly recommended big fan ckii put lot hours base game along agot mod feel like game much good sequel could hoped ive read

virtuous traits character focuses super expanded depending characters stats develop lifestyle experience type stat chose example ruler high military stat get military life experience faster use experience buy traits respective stat thats focus allows characters feel much personalized acquiring traits modifiers felt pretty random dread really cool mechanic intimidate vassals committing dreadful acts like torturing executing people etc stops factions forming bonuses visually game great character portraits animated extremely unique character running well overall think worth getting enjoyed huge fan crusader kings ii one favorite time games crusader kings iii game always wanted little bit learning curve way new ui get hang pretty quick characters actually exhibiting traits awesome lack depth ckii countless expansions downloads isnt blank slate plenty things keep getting stale id wholly recommend game worth purchase huge fan prior game series one delivers much enjoyed

gameplay found couldnt true easily addicted game ive ages fabricating claims strengthening bloodline murdering rivals things imagine head would even someone familiar paradox games lot youtube video watching understand ins outs id say took around hours feel really comfortable gameplay avid fan quite possibly one time favorite games dying new version gameand got find new interface really difficult navigate half time feel though single thing staring screen waiting something pop working military find impossible whole thing confusing unenjoyable enjoying game tribal ruler character inherited domain full feudal holdings cant upgrade construct new buildings effectively ruining current ironman playthrough thats tip iceberg comes number bugsi dont see ever going back also cant recommend game good conscience theyve patched issues thinking buying right would probably wait couple weeks enthralled game awhile hours massively inflated left game running long stretches end cant really recommend lets downthe interactions use shallow many interaction options without large point investments worth get twothe fighting army mechanics shallow war territory peace mechanics terriblethe economy also broken grow massive empire never really gain large influxes money armies good strategies fix realization minor kingdom gameplay massive empire disheartening game worth yea sure exterior flavors wear

track time element randomness game great allows new feeling avoids repetitive nature youre like idea youre getting vet fence id say game definitely worth full price dlc heard dlc usually important games great time killer pandemic im enjoying game expanding realm dynasty amid crazy scheming courts military combat system frustrating since npc armies tend zigzag around obvious reason allies often turn away leave hosed could join secure victory also nice game covers quite bit asia africa change scenery bit im enjoying game lot also falls victim issues paradox strategy games players get sync sometimes game either slows lot simply boots players thats still improvement first couple days multiplayer almost completely unplayable people due poor connections servers top game progresses slower gets removal baronies real factor game simplifies things also removes players ability start baron bit bummer people like climb ranks information characters available lock ruler creator really shouldve

allow control allies least ability merge ally armies otherwise allies hit miss sometimes ai allies save skin times question youre playing game horrendous ai im going put dont recommend full price going keep short simply thoughcompared find game isnt fun lacking lot content albeit added added successive dlc many years seems simplified somewhat opinion ends rail roading strategy bit takes away optionsanother thing would add would prefer could customize character game creation would impart sense ownership give initial control development character new content relies certain character traits giving bonuses based traits serves massive disincentive isnt way want develop character paradox said coming sure along whole bunch dlc time moneyin short find simplified less fun less strategic version hence going recommend stage play microsoft platform month suss would recommendation one wish followed prior purchase im gonna go right bat say game probably appeals players completely new crusader kingsthe older games clunky overcomplicated littered bugsa lot reviews say lacks many integral features hadi say however game lacks nuance makes sturdiness design far comprehensive interactionsif play ck roleplaying strategy game better choice farsimpler easier understand generally performs quite superbly im wonderful time generating massive dynasty plopping kids everywhere learning curve bit steep like paradox grand strategy games similar enough able figure stuff pretty quickly number features gated behind techs dont unlocked yet dont worry yet im impressed little missed eight years expansions almost hours played far theres room improve feat distilling best aspects previous game removing improving frustrating ones makes game immersive experience fantastic far future promising im impressed visuals wasnt expecting look good improved many base mechanics many features part dlcs theyve updated game free ruler designer used paid dlc game looks like lot replayability like predecessor even add shattered world update future im scratching surface crusader kings like lot fun seems better polished every way ways much fleshed intrigue stuff especially

ui map character models easily best ive ever seen strategy title genetic inheritance aging really well done many unique faces come across look believably humanto sure game still pretty complex title succession tangled webs feudal hierarchies easy wrap brain around game good job making important information accessiblethere things bother relatively minor grand scheme things undoubtedly addressed

notoriously unpolished releasesall said game moments cant give thumbs truly know bit events mechanics im pleasantly surprised shell expecting paradox succeeded reproducing lot best qualities crusader kings without dumbing gameplay addition knights major plus heard stress going major game mechanic feared work way annoying killer little control fortunately way implemented makes much sense beautiful graphics music also enhance overall experience love addition dread finally behave like real medieval monarch without provoking constant rebellions vassals however maybe bit op moment downsides unrealistic cultural diversity ahistorical weirdness hilarious byzantines losing constantinople making dublin new capital adultery incest gone wild every single one wives even chaste ones many heretic religions though cool create hopefully paradox fix problems modders already done overall good first look surely turn another great one paradox im really enjoying game far love flexibility religion

making heir law superiority play without worry much game wasnt bad ended got faction everyone hated son killed one family sinning traits jorvik super weird said easy started sure bands died became
