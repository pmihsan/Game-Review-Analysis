hours trying manage ruler related relations holdings etcthe scope game huge planning expansions going get bigger betterbe mindful game relies heavily screens windows interact world view world battles etc ok awesome experiencehighly recommend arranged marriage son heir beautiful intelligent girl years marriage romanced fathered grandson came age found thicc prestigious piece kit marry could keep pants year plotted succeeded kill play cuckedbydaddy son would get comfortable game start enjoy great game im getting older honestly cant stand games require read wiki order begin understanding play make grumpy want come home play game without spend hours understand convoluted mechanics im happy report exception preferencethere bisb learning curve first hours much newbie friendly get time around clicks youll hooked stop playing wake early morning im excited sink many hours game coming weekend time play ive grown older video games generally dont keep attention like used game exception tons fun would recommend anyone vet hours registered ive gone lofty expectations look sequel expectations met thats ok ive kept open mind still remember met hefty dose cynicism dogged heels release months least hearts iron vast improvement loved changes day one people quick call dumbed streamlined mainstream mess really wasnt made game accessible fun play importantly improved upon third installment multitude waysnow comes crusader kings sadly cant say everything dire though hallmark ck series always characters vastly improvedi love character models something kinda worried previously looked jerky odd previews look fantastic variant styles looks female characters well look abit samey work needs done male characters seem gotten attention however much immersive dealing models get attached recognize certain characters visually rather recognizing name roleplaying perspective immersive one scores top pointsthe interface received major overhaul definitely lovehate deal although im somewhere middle like areas im still immensely frustrated certain aspects one example death popup alert get popup alerting characters death maybe friend council member window pops simply tells character died thats big window name mention died want find died manner death quite important ck know game schemes rampant murder find gotta click character link popup hover mouse tiny tiny little hardtosee skull icon next name find died surely information could present popup moment come across multiple annoyances like thisthis prevalent issue present certain notifications schemes mainly newcomers understand frustration issues still popping third iteration game hear people say interface clean great intuitive well certainly clean intuitive newcomers certainly still plagued problems ironed multiple window navigation remains problem im confident fixedonto ai well nothing good say cant speak intercharacter interactions yet ai handles ive seen far army ai war atrocious compared isnt area im worried fully expect improvements ai patches one till get level satisfactory disappointing ai much worse since attachment system attach army ally heavily reliant ally ai making good decisions war unfortunately ai loves loves go fights possibly cant win outnumbered sometimes move without singular purpose coherent structure ai isnt amazing allies least useful provided used attach system lacking really see flaws come ultimately disappointing ai actually worse previous game series paradox youre spreading far many projects starting showif new ck series want much accessible game newcomers enjoy vets though series spot problems many frustrations yet fixed isnt certainly isnt bad imperator fairly bareboned game justifiably got thrashed launch isnt third iteration hoped finally content didnt go thinking would dlc ha didnt expect much cut even minor things cant ask liege appoint council even though im friends one powerful vassals cant make half decisions im used feels like im sitting around time far less despite greater level immersion characters much content missing would surprised paradox invest much time reincorporating without resorting selling bits pieces dlc ruler designer confirmed flc yay small small token compared everything else treasuries nope great works nope greater council interaction nope regency nope although suspect paradox took regencies reason cant play republics make fun hope case regencies real purpose could go places thisit also disappointing play byzantines favourite thing play flavor theyve received dlc attention present pretty much play bogstandard feudal system something im expecting pay later roadparadox gone record state plan follow dlc plan game like ea sims meaning reselling dlc content present prior game severe doubts fully expect paying cleverly disguised dlc future contains content past iterations much missing simply including flc patches investment cant picture paradox doingwith said improves areas stepback series lot ways hope suspect may revisit review give recommendation sometime next year game starts getting peppered patches hopefully free content expansions along original dlc fingers crossed may come ownright cant recommend vets series especially full retail price youre better waiting sale getting may better picture game like veteran must highly reccomend crusader kings iii wanted get found hardoverwhelming game freedom streamlined optimised maximum fun king never easy veteran really like features dlcs represented game improved uponthe new interface improved player guidance make game joy play much easier new playersno bugs encountered would recommend ckii fan loved version way simplistic bad way hopefully dont pull paradox bad overflood dlc kidding totally jew italian alps wiped

lacks several features added various expansions ckii would probably assume features added future expansions game though someone bought majority ckiis expansions leaves bad taste mouth sort bummed seems like plan pulling old bag tricks reusing contentcurrently game limited playable years doesnt seem much difference flavor events per region ability play republics removed diseases reaper removed holy orders seem removed theyve bastardized council system keeping elements slew thingsnothing truly ground breaking added menus dont seem nearly indepth far dice rolls combat seem wildly varying

people abusing system somehow b boats bthey removed boats reason anybody get water without needing anything near even land locked country without major river lake next border still get ocean embarking disembarking takes forever making hard run enemy get cornered raiding also removed connections rivers found prevent going scandinavia going byzantium could added small navel warfare something else really liked boats limited options attack distant lands islands b raiding bthere boat drop loot anymore isnt much reason raid rich neighbors stay long impossible raid anyone far even reason barley carry money much micro involved risk losing money raided difficulty getting away ai love chasing super far generally stopping leave territory large nation randomly small raid tend get one two places flee cant risk giving money spent time afraid army wiped leaving open war armies barley carry loot even spend much risk raid weak nations much time little money b governments bthere two different

inclusion however never played singal game long enough notice much difference cant worse number increase occasional building unlock b overall dislikes bthis game feels like paradox tried new things one usual halfbaked games patch dlc years free recommend playing buying dlc think affect game dont plan playing game much solo like dont havent played yet friends play said games addition stellaris think lot problems things wont change ill buy fix doubt theyll able renew love raiding cant really add boats said wanted raiding risky think risky dont know governments look like future thatll probably change think dumb released boats could thought better instead completely removing sack ai stupid use properly ai still dumb enough feels weird wanted remove addition rp game somehow peasants landlocked country carry entire navy halfway across africa boat england makes sense dont get gone past testingb last bit bi made review couple month since last play session went see changed court

neighbors sees weak low levies money etc get attacked immediately countries game looks unfinished missing things cannot say even things prepared buy tonns dlcs sure compared complete better value recommend compared one thing like dont really like perk really define playstyle controlling realmlearning perks sucks really hard martial perks overpowered considering probably war lot neighbors ruler good martial ability always preferred compared characters prettier believable event choices matter world feels alive choices made ai events also affect map sight sore eyes bordergores even without graphical mods political marriages prevalent due need secure strength numbers via expansive alliances especially game noticeably harder predecessors due ais tendency ally powerful states variety religions doctrines topnotch music fitting immersive much better time seduce pope homosexual king compared imperator game better feels actually good launch compared paradox games played release one far best new character portraits great far detailed old system ruler designer straight upgrade real gripe mechanics arent present playable merchant republics artifacts system compared previous paradox titles game potential also content filled decently playable lesser bugs compared previous titles compared rather different better way lot things consider played find feels lot different ui mechanics however main concepts major things implemented good instead empty gamei really hope paradox learned lessons instead posting barely polished games like rome focus decently finished game polish details hope less dlcs content instead spamming lots little ones day perspective easily hope add details bugfixes time compared vanilla drastic improvement paradox stated ruler designer released free update im sure expect plenty dlc years come playable governments eliminated guess paradox planningthe learning curve less steep new players gamers new experience able dive much easily returning player couple hours logged little trouble adjusting forget muscle memory actions religion system vastly improved much fun play ability stay part parent religion wildly deviating old teachings forming branch cool

appalling issue paradox already dealt added way life dlc right way really combat ironman choose play inverted gender laws play female rulers sure lineage descends fromthat assuming daughter doesnt get promiscuous play option completely invert gender laws extremely pseudohistorical way cant restrict ais ability seduce dont know something secondly special inheritance laws borked basically main inheritance laws divided two sections multiple successors single successor choose six culture research prerequisite technology choose early start date expect wait ingame years get primogeniture succession however attach special succession laws titles change theyre inherited based culture lets say two sons second son superior stats want play special succession laws opportunity pass main titles onto assuming play cards right issue comes passing along head dynasty household game ignores special succession laws basically noob trap kill run trying give titles second son first son get control dynasty make complete headache impossible get back control player character game succession inheritance probably main game mechanic unacceptablethere things ive noticed theyre fairly minor
