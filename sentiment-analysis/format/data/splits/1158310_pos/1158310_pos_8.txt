ground also improved succession system opinion many situations wont able change succession type something truly favorable makes game difficult usually race see fast could get premogeniture would never touch succession againas someone put hours far would recommend game fun old players new ones alike new series never played game much easier learn however sure yet would recommend going trying buy game free like basically guarantee like game best part game depth npcs army war aspect really sold game honestly great game needs work expected new pdx games looking forward future game review someone played heavily dont expect whole differently new game core structure games ie battles strategy changes say actually feel believe makes game worthy successor listed suchdifferences army structure revamped bit allow say quality army nice touch hooks allows new intrigue options gameplay life style took ambition feature gave depth detail new religion havent gotten feature yet looks dope create religion depth graphics small touch immersive effects character better displays physic traits makes realize messed typhoid isverdict similarities may say vamped youre expecting totally new gameplay might disappointed expect bit game much better immersion cool new stuff worth buy uh women keep joining court naked complaining anything usually mod kind content though lol hours game good paradox style wont great til dlcs inthe goodui much cleaner still trouble getting show region intuitivelyskill trees lifestylethe awesome needs tweakshooks great vassals useless anyone else needs path utility eg spousecombat supermobs still happen crusades point ai army starts starving variation specialization countering unit types siege unit types great needs little tweak giving info rally troopsthe annoyingsome obvious things worked well like personal items societies arent yet sure paid dlc ended addicted pretty addicted days almost surpassed hours alot content added next probably less years would grab content comes little time paradox keep busy almost decade many things pick country play time almost took scandinavia denmark spreading viking religion everywhere first catholic crusade barley made left vikings everywhere still sweden totaly wrecked england goals make astrau one true faith taking pope jihadi making mongols b world domination rule skal set restore roman empire first playthrough italian duke end fun expanding realm actually interactions characters along way make playthrough unique memorablewhen im seducing sister improve relationship getting blackmailed spymaster plotting murder said spymaster whos also uncle one powerful vassals fail rise rebellion thats fun oh also got second attempthowever thats similar enough prettier version well yes actually noof course many similarities core mechanics overarching themes remain features im missing notably ability influence education children collection artefacts treasuresbut time many changes improvements really like beyond neater interface nice modelsthe intrigue system much fleshed lifestyle choose much bigger impact gameplay give abilities really alter gameplay technology system actually matters techs dont give static modifier dont care actually unlock stuff profound impact gameplay least like inheritance laws examplei also really like new stress system encourages take decisions according attributes character events inevitable mental breakdowns hilariousperformance another thing positively surprised game runs smooth threeyearold laptop ram actually faster think almost never used highest speed set game time almost passed fast game get bit slower first hundred years didnt get much worse im pretty sure well hear much less performance stellaris performance constant issue though ill say might better play game higher resolution entire screen plastered messages alerts might actually see bit pretty mapthere still much room either dlcs mods expand upon diplomacy options severely lacking trade almost completely absent playing roman empire byzantium assume feel different feudal king doesnt events also become bit repetitive also qol stuff sorely missing diplomatic map mode said amazing scope release version especially paradox game doesnt feel game okayish become good major patches dlcs years game amazing already get even betterespecially modding community got time work art like best total war game ever released lord rings mod medieval best paradox game ever released game thrones mod probably take year cant wait one even though shudder think sleep cycle game enough damage already ill assume people reading already played least vague picture minds words critique comparison previous gamelets start best part opinion roleplaying enjoy personal bent crusader kings strategy games get rebellion someone steals wife soviet union british empire actual character personality wont get vengeance geopolitical entity person behind thoroughly relieved find aspect lessened previous game onemechanically speaking base game feels quite wholesome paradox first installment dread lets bully vassals adore lifestyle perks knights feel lot better commanders ever feel like stress mechanics overall annoying oh council much much better actually lot councilor option ever feels useless something cannot said council ordersalso first time franchise actually idea hell happening combat admit greatest player makes praise im giving higher paradox made combat simple enough clueless guy like understand granted hardcore player might good thing allnext ui mixed bag far less cluttered previous one probably higher odds knowing available button hand pending issues feel bit awkward people used issue generating new alert top screen however admit got used new ui dont mind half much nowreligion way waaaaay better many branches heresies denominations game feels incredibly complete also apart ludicrous piety costs faith reformation system already tops previous game dlcsfinally ai lets clear absolutely loathed chase enemies armies way tibet could force surrender final defeat fixed theres much less running around lot headbutting always plus feel like alliances bit abused computer feels somewhat preposterous petty conflict ireland draws attention like different european countries cant say spectacle seeing thousands troops disembarking murder minimal conflict amusingmy one complaint far absurd events seem greatly reduced maybe unlucky werewolves possessed people certainly crazed shamans following pagan faiths wandering around stuff like hellenic revival old borrow jewsexpel jews tactic yet either fine detailsi think game quite satisfying release thrilled find paradox implement societies deal religions got less love past zoroastrianism judaism future expansions ive played couple hours far thoroughly enjoying time game stories come game downright hilarious currently building empire inbred abominations ill update review comes inevitable conclusion far recommendation basically liked youre probably going like though hear people initially liked game kind stopped playing sure thats case heres think opinions may varyoverall feels like crusader kings enough keep player interested room improvement found game breaking issues problems ive seen things like tool tip mistakes slight balancing issues areas additional content would help game fairly polished quite stablethe lifestyle perk trees focuses brilliant one best parts game alliances seem important stress mechanic thought going silly big deal provides another rpg aspect game boats maintain im okay game play feels better without mechanic dont really miss themif youve played know might find bit easy least impression hours playing hardest difficulty im sure yet im lucky play early viking tribal get strong ally pick weak countries wait opportune moments like right succession alliances dissolve kingdoms split apart youre going feasta lot doesnt appear difficult go chieftain king one charactergraphically get characters look alive map quite nice menus large think maybe bit much im often moving windows way look another window occurred im writing may setting somewhere ill check next time play interface good though nothing feels place awkward items important keep eye easy find easy find way around learn ui quicklythere still minor bugs dont find bothersome end think solid bugs probably cleaned pretty quickly additional content title could phenomenal yes im aware paradoxs dlc prices suggest waiting buy half dlc releases probably wont worth buying anyway wait bit hear reviews get want goes salestill even without dlc think base game worth buying bought release though dollars less list worth id even say knowing know would paid full price quality game needs tweaking one feels half empty need major work one games release say first beautiful game great intuitive ui worthy predecessor overall makes dealbreaker opinion combat system limited aid ai allies great could assign ai allies specific counties attach armies supplement forces etc ai ai wants ability actually supplement forces ai aid furthermore like menatarms commanderknight idea fantasticbut cant decide flank want specific troops like could makes everything completely random utterly frustrating force including allies superior opponent get bent barrel incompetence leaves devices overall considering combat system easy overall considering combat system easy much amazing work went game great become better arent many every problem ever game devs fixed patches also fixed lot stuff didnt know problems obviously changes get used anyone thats played lot overall huge upgrade love new scheme systems councilors work think portraits characters much realistic immersive ui overall also big improvement except constant giant banner popups unending stream minor events jarring disruptive map zoomed view vassals also busy tastes still would highly recommend game youre fan sostarted count desmond breed sons daughters third son

continuation crusader kings series many things improved streamlined however issues one toggle character allowed forbidden leading armies feature removed paradox another console far tell accessible starting game debugmode hassle game pretty great change almost aspects especially tech focus tree however unplayable gamebreaking bugs crashing game plagued multiple saves cannot recommend time edit

confusing first since pretty used easy get used tooverall im enjoying immensely youre new series recommend looking comments aswell easy get fun play either way fun marry family game alright stands lot things simplified better worse military aspects made incredibly simple use time also quite tedious convoluted involvement individual characters combat welcome addition one probably could introduced elegantlyfor paradox game dont think game worth asking price worth rebate price right nowget sale preferrably couple major overhauls ones military frameworks revision government framework considering getting get deep discount may scratch itch really great yet game amazing incredibly fun play developers really payed attention history something youll notice play like king england stating special troops historic battle took place genghis khan appearing massive army high quality troops busted casus belli keeps thing realistic game truly excels ability start anyone even count eventually rule whole empire albeit thorugh conquering marrying scheming far favorite run date starting small indian nation lanka eventually creating roman empire lmao also enjoyed run become king jerusalem first crusade queen case long contributed eventually creating outremer empire game definitely unbalanced aspects personally find game easy comes point youre playing know thing stopping conquering casus belli time youll absolutely wipe floor enemy start making gold turn sets menatarms game ai indian run defended crusade jerusalem pope time defending genghis khan back india massive horde menatarms spawn immediately fieldanother aspect thats kindof broken pope crusades even amount troops contributing crusade like unlanded hell still crusade way dismantle papacy unless specific religions changed maybe something along lines catholic counties support papacy crusades last years sometimes let go till war score hits controlling war target makes impossible hold decisions since major ones require war decision make roman empire requires certain amount prestige ruler died waiting crusade end grind prestige back next ruler frustratingthe rebellions another broken aspect thats frustrating know need game realistic purposes wow point theyre annoying anything else outremer run youre catholic ruler next bunch islamic religions every county control revelling every year every goddam year somethiems year youre conquering fast realm huge greek rebels constantinople english rebels london islamic populist rising mecca defending crusade wont end cause cant capture pope game fantastic definitely give go many good aspects make run ruler feel different outremer run begun count aaragun something like created confederation switzerland holy roman empire got elected hre one rulers eventually switched queen jerusalem kept claim hre eventually got back removing princely elective law holding hre outremer empire amazing game definitely try game amazing id like way coat arms dynasty

despite logistical costs sanity normandy catholic friends realistically troops must sent distances crusade next example playing irish king holland part holy roman empire declares war take dorset alliance france france disembark whole army troops shores besiege dorset help friends rival holy roman empire unlike first case seljuks much closer war theatre almost similar culture ok want help whole french army get paris besieged looted happened stupid behavior even stupidest rulers world normally ok expect contingent army help improved fixed example closer ally firstly geographically culture religion common interests chances expect go end sending whole army huge army sent middle east britain absurd also want drive attention endless extension great powers byzantine empire holy roman empire looks like molds map digested around id like see stronger separatism movement empires collapses least ai side wish players turn affect also players big realm many small issues example set
