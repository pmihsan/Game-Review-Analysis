feels like things kids fun experience cant get enough addicting well balanced feels quite immersive time period game suck hours hours life away constant planning plotting love fun fun game waste life away good way extremely depth lot strategy involved long haul great game would recommend game would awesome oh boy game needs serious balance updates first seduction problem everyone tries seduce everyone often succeeds want see bad gets turn debug mode see everyones real genetic parents father five kids chances none practically defeats purpose cool new depth genetics system added ones parents game says also make common notice qa ill admit world every man cuckold kind funny takes right immersionnext issue immersion birth developers game decided lower chances mother child dying childbirth last game even though already seemed lower point events spending resources comforting wife pregnant little chance going wrong anyways also children almost always grow without many complications even though middle ages large amount children died within first years life im asking hyper realism stuff least make attempt seem feasiblenext issue catholicism seems within hundred years starting catholic europe turned various heresies catholicism comes events turn characters heresies think two main reasons spreads quickly first lord changes religions game changes religion lords lands quickly unrealistically next catholicism gets frequent events lower religious fervor point catholic lands converted far quickly played religions yet cannot comment balance next problem game dynasty head system may missing something seems game explicit explanation current dynasty head selected powerful adult king closely related last dynasty head third cousin count vassal six years old becomes head dynastymany lifestyle perks unbalanced everyone else mentioning comment last issue bring sexuality think step forward add bisexuality asexuality game way sexuality implemented seems like step back first problem characters completely open sexuality character homosexual kept close secret public lords ninth century muslim caliphate completely open gayness makes sense next smaller problem distribution sexualities characters identify homosexual bisexual asexual comparison san francisco highest percentage lgbt people us population identifies lgbt thats representation crusader kings like far need balance game make immersive experienceedit ive got say going get warfare post getting long think two main issues one ai tends zerg rush capital making tedious predictable next issue embarking system cost sending massive armies across seas low ai probably realizes constantly send armies overseas also makes distance sea travel barely matters unlike expensive fleets made use sparingly least big enough use vassal fleets fix honestly think reverting back naval system work something would best optionthe peace treaty system hand something definitely carried isnt dynamic realistic think best kind would something like victoria sides add certain claims demands cost something unlike essentially demand whatever want though also option demand money reparations like game would aptly named cuck

mechanics game seem welcoming overwhelming unlike crusader kings ii first time tried tends heavy atmosphere even though want play game continuously pushes finish campaign took long time cope heavy feeling im gamebut first time tried im already engaged gameplay graphics makes welcoming game im edge thumbs keep playing learning curve slow starts probably going turn almost everyone dedicated fan sort game looking game sim rpg rather strategy game given ability switch kingdoms wont readily apparent everyonepros lots historical context world full people interact rulers dynasties instead immortal rulers means mix game style map covers essentially europe asia good chunk africa ability switch realm youre playing opens options play narrative rather competitive focus game emphasis total dominationcons lousy ui much clicking around particularly challenging managing intrigue diplomacy interacting wealth characters game slow game starts despite launching established explored world gold cheats help many actions take long game years intrigue options take silly amounts time limit intrigues active time low least starting military management intuitive weak even start figure bugs course worst seen far strong army somehow becoming strong army enemys numbers went combat started instead game mechanic ambush happened nothing could see told mewishes fixing cons mode play nonruler otherwise start much smallerit feels like rich mine complexity poor ui slow game starts make huge time investment feels like mixing metaphors historical diplomacy real time strategy far much results glacial play keeps busy crawling screens result feels grindythe ui fun killer game trying make diplomacy intrigue paramount yet much information actions buried behind multiple layers menus screens feel like im going pause slowing game way often need get tasks exacerbated inconsistent handling ui elements widgets map screen move stay view bring side window others dont ones get hidden seem often ones need keep eye game isnt pause game also explains concepts poorly youre never quite sure relationship one vassals means anything ui also terrible around armies map view general click right spot often armies seems like click feet bc map location little man hot spot capital little hard get right click get city instead character details raising armies takes serious getting used really easy really screw get beyond handful territories im still sure im actually drawing properly strength vassals wargame starts slow theres meaningful way ive discovered change start tutorial limits ireland feels like trying build skill kingdom whole lot seems like kingdoms ive started position immediately conquer neighbors youd overextended immediately seems like youre hours turning turtle build really start playing game aggressively sometimes enjoy often want accelerated start even playable kingdoms bigger start feel need turtle much start game operates around dynasties rather immortal rulers poor explanation game mechanics incredible amount game time many diplomacyintrigue actions seem take often see ruler dying whole lot important current ruler player character watching relationships get changed succession needing basically restart threads painful thats partly realistic successor ward better complete influence thats limited number intrigues support time incredible length time take become problem adds unfortunately meaning cheat codes probably future tweak game play good follow much fun good game good game good game play like start drama good game review complete fall sales tasks good game despite negative review however paradox let refined bland sequel one best grand strategy games ever released ui roleplaying decisions game mediocre successor opinion ui particular despite step towards right direction ugly uninspiring map significant upgrade beautiful artistic immersivebut importantly lack nomads societies republics significant features make game inferior product predecessor time however im aware paradoxs monetization practises safely say game eventually surpass quality release major expansions years development exactly review subject change future good game much pog good game somewhat lacking updates starting good game hard good way get mind gutter good game daughtersisterwife agrees good game play good one solid foundation build uponthis paradox know da wae forward crashes good experience needs secret societies tho gg gorgeous game tremendous amount avenues forge characters destiny dynastys legacy love think make hard choices game great effort streamlining making accessible new players clearly one two players grumbling dumbed feel game lot happening background rather appearing constant popup messages im looking forward come way

complicated never played ck ii ck took hours figure play familiarize mechanics complicated learn youll find extremely fun great game easier get enjoy playing hours without getting bored definitely worth full price great game mods fun play great game great game loved think even better great game thoroughly enjoyed ck ii developers taken everything good game made even better ck iii great game currently somewhat lacking variety really get feudal christian experience differences gameplay playing anything else negligible said still offers much focus procedural storytelling dynastic politics

right fun play introduction new functions made game lot entertaining include troop qualitymenatarms regiments life focuses intrigue plots many would definitely recommend game anybody new acquainted crusader kings also great game start understand map games play great sequel worth buy full price contains improved tutorial improved ui new mechanics eg stress system animated characters ignore

innovation role playing different levels information zoom map great idea new ui makes everything easier understand looks good generally different kinds experience scores allow try different goals ruler one favorite steam games far century great skeleton paradox game unless super grand strategymanagement games group really want play isnt worth yet give couple years buy dlc bundle given time exceptionalalso game needs serious balancing great start continuation series needs lot development could use lot historical accuracy boosting example raiding restricted cultures religions game several christian kingdoms known raid without technical state war scottish would often raid northern part england distracted foreign entanglements also need work intrigue portion game see coming development game far give stars really good start hope better development future great update crusader kings series things feel lacking really outweighed benefits new ui great fantastic game many things manage fantastic history simulator type game doesnt require win simply enjoy story youve build dynasty gameplay similar ck series thus far slight tweaks notably graphics lot better characters aging time gaining visual traits reflect abilities new hyperlinking mouseover features make easier ever find necessary conditions events diving deeper character historiesoverall think game excellent successor paradox stop nickel diming players feature packs release actual beefy expansions huge step ui much easier see actually tell whats happening time roleplay fun amount customization always welcome lots mechanics use work would say solid game however games vassalage system behaves highly unrealistic point piss de jure vassals want independence instead supporting another kingemperor border gore game absolutely burn eyes holy roman empire start date fall apart years game time way vessels behave huge downside game things completely randomly powerful vassal positive opinion spy master vassal still revolted fk thats really need fix ways vassals behave point total utter ridiculousness counts tyranny also really dumb tell vassal stop war another vassal refuse trying imprison count tyranny vassalage system joke needs huge overhaul short reign penalty needs nerfed everybody loved previous emperor new one donate treasury vassalage combat men arms mechanic solid although archers seem little overpowered one gripe interactions break immersion characters side diplomatic range scots character seduce swedish one within days im pilgrimage jerusalem able interact vassals kings people try seduce pilgrimage traveling army take time rather instantly teleporting capitol sieged youre assign army save war form jaws defeat also need events happen familiar paradox supports games post launch game fun would recommend especially friends play lots frustrating mechanics game make want tear youre hair idrect upgrade waiting dlc features get added really fun like maybe ability customize ruler

siege capital moment apart viking raiders cultures march army back period get boat head enemys capital alert youll soon find ways deal expect ai behaviour war get attention sooner later substantial improvement previous paradox launches understand game already horrendously confused never played ive heard easier approachable experience mean game bit easier would like roleplay helps hope paradox adds harder difficulties even ai buffit fun opinion setbacks succession crises civil wars wish aspects empires declining byzantine empire usually grows substantially superb game enjoy intrigue character interactions feels like taking part game thrones without dragons monsters intrigue politics set courts early late middle ages fascinating many complaints see game players trying put modern

hordes items buildings still limits diplomacy side like events source receiver increasing opinion relatively minordid played different nations culture period yet though content might richer yetbut new launch clean fan series need hesitate way better normal release paradox think people gotten bit overzealous ratings im gonna try bring perspective major annoyances ive seen partition inheritance blows cant get rid last years game ive rarely ever played get around first dozen times spending hours murdering heirs loses charm becomes chore even cheating doesnt fix bullshit since every month checks allowed certain laws reverts crusades completely broken right crusade maybe gets andalusia great reformed norse faith happens half powerful established vassals realm dont lose titles new crusader king maybe troops faces incessant unstoppable revolts religious rebels every year flips crusader kingdoms back original faith cases tribal starts pretty much waste time right changing tribal feudal always

overwhelmed understand game concepts minutes closed game really disappointed guys fun beginning please trust methis game amazing get used everything totally doable fun create dynasty expand kingdom onthis game much discover many opportunities highly recommend try even maybe like really games like maintaining dynasty aspect worth buying although ive got say came tough frustrating often options cannot anything really nasty thins example loosing empire remove one pointrating preface really wanted like game hours easily one favorite strategy games end came blind didnt watch dev diaries prerelease games could judge game purely finished product said solid game retains many positive features predecessor characterfocused gameplay good simulation feudal vassalage system endless replayability due rng branching game decisions noticeable improvements made increase character roleplay inclusion stress mechanic clever way encourage player adherence ruler traits without restrictive theres also far events tailored specific lifestyle enjoy really make think hard character character react fleshed scheme system makes plots actually interesting follow feels much immersive sway liege assassinate rival ever one favorite additions new siege mechanics rng siege events totally random never actually made much sense seeing increasing starvation disease take garrison faster much logical appreciate change heres problem even though good game cant help feeling like paradox played safe making sequel didnt add truly innovative additions predecessor hours play found processes appeasing vassals fabricating claims planning marriages find enjoyable made feel slightly disappointed get beyond cool new roleplay features enhanced scheme system new military system core plays essentially fact moments considered launching instead continuing one games highlights feel missed opportunity create different new gameplay environment would interesting learn veteran new player perhaps change dlc additions come stands right theres enough makes want drop entirely favor another issue ive noticed rng still heavily present game longer truly random dont get wrong weird rng moments made sense given context see siege events one thing really well catching player guard even hours gameplay doesnt really seem happen lot events set timer increases time special events claim fabrication great example good chancellor increased probability fabricating claim didnt guarantee within specific window time could fighting two wars suddenly get option gain claim gold cant actually spare new system basically know max days court chaplain fabricate claim sort insanely fast imo realize start saving appropriate gold rarely caught guard goes sieges one beauty super random events enemy army could lose surprising amount soldiers besieging one holdings could give edge needed engage field battle even ground basically constant attrition attacker barring supply problem makes difficult smaller army take larger one without hiring mercs even numbers sum good game cant recommend time current state game feels much like heavily improved totally different title really makes hard justify buying game probably get cheaper hopefully fleshed time goes unless really want play gameplay improvements mentioned would advocate get basic gameplay experience prosvastly improved roleplay experience due trait handling better lifestyle eventsfleshed intrigue scheme system makes plots much engaging employnice improvement siege system simulate garrison suffering starvation disease timepretty cool character models try dressing toddlers crusaders barbershopconscurrent version feels lacking content compared dlc additions may change time game progressesmost plotsactions happen set timer rather randomly within mtth window adds predictability game imo makes game slightly less interestingthe ui slightly hard understand especially comes holding management event popups could bias im used interface still rather difficult find certain options various game menus core current version plays similarly almost point feels indistinguishable times hoped new title would also mean plethora innovate additions drastically change gameplay point feels much like heavily improved brand new game put simply great fun beautiful paradox given us masterpiece perfectly evolved series crusader kings mechanics changed much good grown one acknowledge work love devs well done indeed ps hope creative heads ck turn onto imperator make good game quote great swedish fish veery gud review game tell story time game quest

world simulator advice play character generate interesting scenarios look traits character think would playing narrative great experience truly fun game historic elements liking ck thus far truly one best games ever made truth told im brand new series whole first time play crusaders kings becoming one favorite strategy title time yet everything interesting enjoyable including complex setting varied decisions shake whole universe dynasty ends historical accuracy ai comes history going motions thats fine us though see developers took artistic liberties representation medieval europe nevertheless characters look fantastic medieval uniforms ai seems smart enough make good decisionsto sum crusaders kings good job creating wellmade believable simulation ruler mid ages even dont feel like micromanaging stuff theres still plenty keep things interesting im quite interested handled transition kings regular lords really liked going far back start seeing strange shift towards political conflict players ai thing though almost game involving politics would need kind system center whereby decisions made solely based around money games take anything different try crusader kings since free like love game trying find something pushes come back find always starting new games really coming back old ones sometimes mid game really grind let treaties character expire enjoy game slow times slowwwww findmyself speed clicking notifications mindlessly get certain date game lets play turn family tree family circle iediting steam awards lmao turned europe bunch naked people good religion recommended turned family tree family circle would recommend turns game traits passed next generation well first child giant second child dwarf third child hunchback inbred huh perhaps sleeping sister isnt really good ideanext try seduce horse caligula style well definitely recommending drama show turns really fun disney villain turns make great games release well two big game randomly unselects whatever selected random window pops change settings everytime starting game u humble duke tending crops small land commit incest going crusade choice ui clunkier less efficient still great game even though still prefer ui much intuitive found actually able get game easier think design tutorial recommended starting characters makes easy learn important things quick nuances time ui much better predecessor ui still bit clunky cant wait character creation much better imperatorfor matter much better crusader kings launch ui much easier graphics great love roleplaying aspects little difficult find items compared ui much friendly graphics character models look great religion cultural system huge improvement said ive played christian kings pagan religions never thing combat naval system could definetly improve im sure thats comingonly starting dates im sure improve well ui needs lot work surprisingly good release paradox different beast yet familiar update year hell create characters syphilis enjoy watching ckii streams lets plays youtube dumbfounded found didnt live enjoyment watching played another crusader kings would recommend watching still eg arumba thisll help explain indepth take dive game far less difficulty beforenot easier get finely aided tutorial feels better overall overwhelming beginning complexity oh boy im going deny inherited much added ckii dlcs new benefits hindsight paradox given ckiis age comes form ui gameplay tweaks feel right accommodate new players ever beforethis certainly isnt deepest commentaries reviews lack detail comes someone enjoyed watching ckii immensely couldnt get playing maybe although given much im enjoying ckiii cant see happening time soon ugh soo goood head trying bring expectations since sequel ckii well sequels arent always good ckiii broke expectations upgraded ui new gameplay elementsim loving sure things missing ckiii baseanyone knows pdx knows iteration brings better better features base game sorry seems rushedgotta get back playing ckiii ultimately many quirks engine simplistic design decisions ruin experience make reluctant play example stress kill people chain reactions dynasty people maybe whole dynasty die day stress nothing could salvage save many hours careful keep dynasty alive theres also systems feel rough edges happy admit feel like improvement ckii especially regarding face variety say wait years developers flesh game modders adequate time fix things add things allow game finish cooking look forward trying pointin current state game fun get past sense house cards kicked arbitrary unfitting random design decisions underdeveloped overly simplistically implemented game elements wish could play feel invested committed save unfortunately seems save timebomb theres ui issues slightly fixed mods like one adding scrollbars menus wish certain lists wouldnt close automatically also able resize elements open separate panel popup list modding bit headache blame wrap things fun game like losing save rng isnt well thought um pretty fun lady poc like choose multiple racists like extra freedom even morals incest naked religions etc like fact options unbelievably better lot replay ability flow game continue fast enough unbelievably fun one ruler average stats double territory vassals love found new kingdom im become exalted among men declare war kingdom next leader dies obesity problems year old son takes kingdom vassals hate perfect opportunity take neighboring kingdom ruined first time game faction rebels yeah pretty fun undoubtedly one best strategy games ever going get better dlcs flavor packs future unfortunately give game thumbs downhere whywhile base systems game improved massively like scheming lifestyles lifestyles amazing really thought good job paradox main concern game clearly based around playing europe feudal systems received really interesting features vassal contracts contracts benefit innovations thats tribal system based prestige much like base game arabicturkicberber based clan system complete joke basically tribal system innovations unlocked useless due adding new perks feudal contracts clan government doesnt management except crown authority cultures like africans share tribal system norwegians cultures tibet byzantine empire feudal like europe right game fun creating religion done want play culture except european nothing except creating new faith would advise buying game expect content compared dissapointed unfortunately features still better guess improved overall nice playing unknowingly played hours felt like unlike lot paradox grand strategy games crusader kings iii manages build previous installment produce experience feels complete rewarding start unlike paradox games launch feels finished game comes basically features base game plus dlc base price point well feel though game welcome grand strategy fans library unplayable crashes time freezes shame looks like itd really fun game worked unreal game great upgrade unreal replayability enjoyment like historical roguelike unreal sequel one greatest games time best paradox game ever made get better update date ck probably best complete pdx release also one better games enter grand strategy genre focus story character driven interactions truly modern ui perfect gateway update met minimum specs experienced frequent crashes upgraded gpu went mb ram crashes would recommend ensuring well beyond games minimum specs purchasing would purchase game time game crashes every time play could minutes hours worked paradox support cannot solve issue requested refund steam would honor play time game fun addicting risk purchasing crash issues resolved high paradox support cannot solve crash issue steam refund start crashing hours game play update since new patch ruler designer chance play game litle bit mods like much nowat moment like far better character customization ui confusing clear waiting till ist character customization mods still good alternative updated review case anyone even still caresa lot issues talked previous reviews actively worked already improved ive gotten lots fun game despite sucking suck gosh darn paradox releasing new ck game right finally getting hang previous game took like hours seeing continuously improved complaints arent valid anymore guess ive got recommend game updated ui graphics nice however several flaws make extremely frustrating number one family simulator main character dies entire holdings decimated split bunch npcs understand supposed mechanic however extremely tedious really fun chars predefined traits try go useful actual tree intrigue ruler wants jump balconys ui ok revolutionary anything battles bland boring numbers marching around higher number usually always wins matter quality army wars happen every seconds neverending stream wars start finish cant unless war score fun chasing stacks circles trying catch themim sure vets ck love hail best game ever supposedly rpg based family simulator medieval ages amazingly boring updated graphics ui brought series would recommend new players play around ireland challenge allows grasp game content easy way focus personal dutchy building buildings else updated graphics characters new features different enough like budget suggest waiting sale otherwise grab sure fan ck series enjoy updated review early bugs annoying resolvedid recommend game anybody enjoyed nice evolution game systems user interface means learning curve pretty manageable dont feel lost dont start watching tutorials playing ingame tutorial really like overhaul looking game modern update dont think theres much disappointed updates improves core gameplay mechanics previous game adding numerous features game playing long time come upgraded mechanics graphics incredibly different first ones might include differences dont understand notice im expert excellent fun replayable usually wouldnt mention different game review game however want casei purchased cyberpunk gog also many aaa title games steam released yearcyberpunk runs flawlessly however personally feel crusader kings goty simply replayability content usually games boat loads dlc get sequels tons cut content things missing yes things worked well werent clunky nothey got best parts added dropping lot didnt work new lifestyle system great addition wholeheartedly recommend game usually cup tea game opened eyes grand strategy games like game thrones simulator cool usually company makes sequel mess entire thing trying necessary paradox maintains great parts adds new things well even immersive liked theres reason add game collection usually wait years flesh games via updates dlc game comes pretty solid jump probably one better box experiences ever done yet utterly immersive historical simulator also absurd fun want game better approach imagination uwu big busty adamites good worth fun game great time far alot game varying difficulty great game strategy players fun game get sucked cool game vassals far likely join independence factions get extremely strong game begins give nothing bad events armies spawn different points next rally location rather one large unit way isolate shut gate bubonic plague hits emperors year due plauge ability shut gate ruined entire play due succesion wars plague vassals avoided plague traveling across entire world attrition threat love game needs much work understand events designed happen wipes fun get events success chance years zero successes vast improvement crusader kings tutorials gameplay graphics vastly improved form predecessor ckiii runs smoothly challenging great depth definately recommendation vastly accessible previous crusader kings games takes figure basics sucks entirely get good handle highly recommend playing along pace treating like family simulator less conquer everything game version completely broken mess worthy sequel tons potential growth addictive loving strategy war side around good game barebones needs expansions good pretty much early access cool much headache get much clear easier play deep interesting game dont expect good beginning played game almost hours learn something every run expect spend lot time game prepared learn alot difficult complex love many things keep track good would say like grand strategy games especially paradox style probably like game like medieval hoi without lines guns planes hoi incest good would recommend people like strategy historic games paradox learning curve rates eve loads fun start understand mechanics well put together much choice uncertainty good got lotta free time accesible comparing paradox titles already fun critical features plus plenty new ones eg stress mechanic giving game whole new layer great foundation future expansions cant wait develop even addicted game good easy understand mechanics really rich world beautiful map still keeps lot intrigue mystery great game right get little easy boring im sure dlcs updates fix great game addicting game bit learning curve though shouldnt issue experience type game would recommend sure addictive civilization type game injects lot personality characters really makes want see family dynasty succeed addictive game needs lot work equal depth predecesor im sure patches dlcs perfect crusader kings gamei like lot things new ck lets name list stress mechanic good force roleplay good immersive knight men arms system clever cause adds strategy game counter enemy troops depending man arms place keep mercenaries case need extra force related previous numbers battle important less quality troops make great difference easy conduct battle ui new buttons functions like one allow leave troops need siege ui workflow pleasing play listthe game also needs tweaks lets name things consider needs ajustmentslist allies ask help often even dont even need help easy gain territory tribal even easy conquest new territory theres almost problem integrating new territory new culture faith send counsellors years integrated perfectly seems theres almost challenge even dont send counsellors revolts minimal big enough country countries dont attack anymore dont unite forces prevent growing even keep conquering conquering owner entire world xdd think kind conferation system like euiv prevents going nutslistin resume im great time playing game know lot better couple years like paradox games addictive sandbox simulator game ruling early medieval till industrial revolution add ons liked youll love

lovers definitely worth shot everyone else sale recommend tutorial never played ck past watching vid explain mechanics confusing new players barebones absolute quality stress mechanic encourages roleplay doesnt limit options game even encourages stress sometimes expanded intrigue nice religions heresies fantastic combat much interesting county developmentmy complaints followsthe multiplayer funky sometimes logs paradox account randomly meaning youll randomly drop games supposedly fixed hasnt though maybe thats shitty connection never problem republics arent yet paradox said werent going charge money features already included nomads republics better come flcdiplomacy barebones would liked see sort barter systemall would definitely recommend game however definitely wary paradoxs dlc traps challenging also rewarding lose something doesnt mean game keeps going adjust fallout kind gameplay always opportunity bounce back various mechanics make game replayable challenging real time strategy cool rpg elements detailed world characters major bugs playthrough far one favorite paradox games ive played complex interesting many different ways play game rewarding fun specific way

disappointing appreciate effort creativity developers however game pictures clicking even game clicking nice pictures high expectations new title paradox tried titles city skylines great remaining clicking game far worse hard believe may moders get somewhere game costly offering fun doubts successful comparing fun get medieval engineers like medieval theme disappointing dynasty based overall good game easily replayed variety different culture groups religions lead take control countries empires eventually world takes little time learn makes rewarding game easy enter expanded tutorial also incredible deep time easy get back vet almost every aspect improved theres less annoying micromanagement focus unfolding storygreat ironman mode achievements enabled together quirky rules like gender reversal equally common sexual orientations managed lot funny situations playing tuscan princess first game died year old queen romagnia due self flagellation wound repent life adultery drinking matricide made sense engaging intuitive game smoother get product made paradox eat free time fans genre enjoyable detailed strategy game fun alone friends basically total war civ combined hint stellaris find ai somewhat competent allthough many people dont agree still havent find situation allies werent useless example played sardinia got mass attacked three different muslim factions called allies came island defend even came way northern france allied armies tend follow around like game however flaws could definetly minor improvements could made probably nearest futurefirst annoying stuff like inviting friends session copying session key dosent work type long ass code inv people easy tp fix pls annoying second find sometimes frustrating wars work time one army attack enemy capital enemy dosent give fuck defending said capital goes hannibal flank around fucking globe get capital mean yeah attack best defense guess feel way annoying deal surely defending main capital empire ais main priority seems realistic dunno even weaker army thats opinion atleastthird rework research tied culture feel like would work better seperated meaning learning used research culture obtained way example events desicions etc basically would love content areafourth point last religion creating faith expensive costs way much piety lackluster mechanics find rather spending piety literally anything else overall would say worth time seek chill interesting game games strength lies story make charachters development charachters events fun immersive shape future dynasty map huge looks awesome cant wait new dlcs added filling even interesting content allthough think game could cheaper bucks seems greedy taste especially free basically equal amount content hopefully add free

divorced second kids dynasty led lot kinslaying became empress couldnt line succession properly ai really made smarter choices didnt even try protect housebloodline even holding kingdom level title sureshot emperor titlealso partitioning titles btw nice primogeniture isnt available much needs reworking lets say kingdoms duchies kids end kingdom title one country duchy title kingdoms territory leads sorts trouble think able choose partition degree course order maintain control gets keeping things divided fairly eg kids duchies primary goes heir choose duchy secondary heir gets perhaps counter balance measure case give weak duchy could get extra prestigepiety might pay prestige piety primary heir simply auto renounces claims siblings territory etc still though fun play worth wait
