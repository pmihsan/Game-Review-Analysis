shot good dlc still pretty fun good great potential even better especially support paradox giving game recommended good end years almoast sure surpas good compared dlcs large learning curve compared much fun imo many features still good fun much learning curve last game still alot fun even though missing content last game also new content replace much content content better designed polished amazing start cant even imagine paradox take years thanks great game dev team badson went king duke count span minutes flogged death shamethinking back opportunity rid chose keep simply good traits seen obvious signs better ckii even hours yet makes crusader kings ii look like recreation game done college student everyone think youre kind person would enjoy game riskcivilization added roleplay youll probably like game theres lots ways play ive found conquering lands least priorities would love see americas australia included map going lie made review badge yes badge steam onto gamemost go game would assume already sights curious mind unsurewould recommend game yes new make character added make beautiful horrid creationsit nice quality life things compared crusader kings could probably get better reviews explain ins outs game better depth mebut want short summary one gotten play much yet great game many games imprison kids join totally cult nudist religion heck make cult uh mean religion nude viking oh get cat dogyes pet also reduce stress nice gonna play game spending tens hours getting achievements dont really recommend buying game early stage dlcs came first hours might fun play late game completely boredom especially going vh achievements speed fabricating claims converting counties tommy said like usual paradox game feels like husk actually content yes theres loads room content added still feels like ck game theres new stuff feels familiar new great fun proudest fap recommend type game great game like fantasy rp aspect nearly complex entertaining way easier pick inn beginning like paradox games get better time issues even close near bad imperator rome good game release polished unprecedented degree perfect best paradox launch far recommend dont dlc perfect yet already amazing improvement previous version especially events ui quite good ckii expansions yet better ckii without expansions far recommendedcombat worse map modes addedremoved reason hotkeys changed game game seemingly reasonstarting duchy trying grow one pretty interesting ai mass allies cannot attack anything wait powerful vassals undo every single law ever done dislike facealso new ui complicated reasondont buy wait first successful dlc fixes game sure game like playing sure game simply failed capture imagination bought advertising hype thinking would good creating storyline characters would care whatever reasonit never caught methis isnt necessarily knock game per se mean reference im big fan sims another game manage minutia reputed create interesting characters stories kinda follow make one works wonders one much probably matter taste nothing morebut im still going give personal recommendation anyone feels may like sorts games doand thats nogo asking refund sorry without flaws however game fun decent amount content get better worth hype doesnt much difference better looking crappier ui worth increased price order get prettier version less features worth time money lets wait dlcs yet slowly improving better playing mods better game need reimplement features removed old one like map modes message filtering give recommendation notable lack depth many areas still worth getting youve played want refresh might well afford price sales coming note come many many hours playing ckii euiv civ franchisesthis iteration ck brings big revamp ckii expansion better graphics new features fundamental distinction role dynasty legacy plays much better opinion since legacy dynastys characters decisions gives gameplay meaning host new improvements buildings currencieslevel systems character traits interactions also lot green pasture improve game later example character builder plagues secret societies limited actions goals overall id give current release fleshing surely improve greatly note review biased crusader kings ii favorite game release tip iceberg become anyone familiar paradox tell areas game weak exciting fully realized change time various dlcs free updates make even better game must said upon release amazing game interested history roleplaying seeing different personality types basically thing different ways worth least checking nothing better sit relax plot world domination nothing amazing sequel amazing game plus titties nothing compares terms great strategy story telling whether taking seriously strategy game play fun compelling story game exciting fun warned though learning curve steep punishing nothing else sctatches itch like ck nothing like coming home hard day work logging expanding empire making everybody yield army like everything goes wrong son murdered people rebelling wife wont stop screwing brother pour heart army greater destroying built nothing matters blood seed strongoh yes crusade eternal glooooory nothing fun making family inbred giants forcing fight nothing quite like taking europe forming greater anglesey know become king backstabbing otherspros good graphics easy learn yet hard master nice soundtrack many faction play major minor country europe india plot twist best partcons battle soundtrack short get fighting feeling soundtrack ends mood spoiling suggest long battle soundtrack loop battle song battle ends enough events variety event keep recycleoverall game enjoyable devs keep adding free content fix bug good read review please understand never really crusader kings im less first time player series think game may saved paradox interactive knew imperator rome failed got lot backlash game beautiful modern graphics stunning completely historically accurate paradox didnt make way wanted forge path game think mechanics brilliant fun even funny however think traits diplomacy systems bit overly complex still fun though mighty king anyone imprisoned murdered say wish hearts iron manpower units system instead levies organizing men arms said paradox learn mistakes imperator rome made game better hope paradox attempts another rome game take page games book dont really complaints surprisingly realistic albeit bit complicated medieval simulator recommend logged hours playing game think provide fair review new crusader kings never played precursors biased whatever gaming experience like general challenging game issues much micromanagement want big court many benefits marry heirs form alliances attract councilors excellent attributes etc etc micromanagement thousand cuts constantly checking see married isnt assigned guardian educator hasnt doesnt game allow option automatically identifying unmarried characters court children educated make things easy stupid game complex cant even figure rules around key aspects game many examples transferring titles game say least totally nonunderstandable unless want study rules hours watch various videos done still doesnt totally make sense especially new bits constantly come vassal vassal leave kingdom take titles stupid frankly would say impossible another example really crazy design nowhere game helps youtube videos chat boards anyone figure retain dynasty head position heard power number titles etc etc nobody knows hilarious major mechanic game completely unexplained game nobody figure lost standing dynasty head explanation found works warfare joke supposed mimic real warfare middle ages like stupid basically create two armies three whatever put trebuchets catapults one army siege castles army chase enemy around map corner crazy nobody fought wars like basically strategy whether win commander best traits forget paying mercenaries required frankly bugs game immensely buggy however game complex nobody really figure something broken cant even tell supposed work believe simple things like ransoming captives says get gold many times lucky get gold happens time dynasty head thing opinion broken somebody tell micromanagement involved developing domains cant tooltips prompts help player know develop domains currently track manually beginning game big deal maybe one two domains frankly empire grows becomes another example tediumother examples unexplainable trying play game suddenly certain vassals courtiers show screen naked whats suddenly forget get dressed went stroll explanation people show naked sometime honestly game ridiculous think people love game nuts real objective grow dynasty fun watching ice melt micromanagement idea hype relative game simply rinse wash repeat except case get married kids educate stress die lose titles start new heir seriously funi love strategy games ridiculous hours game must say one alltime favorite games realism great soundtrack great game play sound game also looks great graphically highly recommend game person like strategic tactical games firm far im concerned ruler designer come proved great character designer systems amount customisation gives ready say crusader kings pretty much updated better version predacessor always special place heart provides features better graphics customisation focus characters flaws bit annoying times yet features predacessor still great enjoyable experience enjoy roleplaying games highly recommend crusader kings theyre adding character creator qol items like definitely say

working server id copy button time theres two themalso notsonice experiences trying open mp make nono mebut quite fun actually works obligatory reviews need mixed recommendationas definitely good packed gills dlc still good enough game rightmany features streamlined genre normally dirty word id say largely done successfully theres fine balance depth ease access walks razors edge well enough theres definitely bugs still around well current favorite children getting bugged completely unable assigned guardianthings would hope see improved ui tech system succession laws firstly ui mess many map overlays gone niceneat way view holdings namely baronies makes searching slots upgrade open places build incredibly tedious physically go individual barony map click map horrible seperation lines trying remember buildings wanting put awful system revamp asaptech system directly tied date investing feels like complete waste time modify chance good roll much stuff gated behind dates means literally cant even try get things end game namely best succession lawswhich brings succession forced partition succession game garbage forcing tribal rulers use worst form partition doubly sense succession law accessibility first things modded partition laws simply fun play also buggy mess often shotguns kingdom leaving primary heir king england owns rolls die devon good luck getting rest back brothers whatever reason inherited full dukedomsas long able overlook game still good obviously doesnt insane amounts stuff mods lot better launch ever would recommend pretty much every area tested blast play come memes stay kickass gameplay obviously couple hours game great game enjoying time spent playing obviously game still new looking one pdxs greatest games fond memories far carrying legacy well course still rough edges grind known features missing still think potential even surpass predecessor additionsthe main thing im missing republics trade routes feature really loved best think far easier get first time players improved notifications popup telling whats going even things like vassalize neighbor shit course many people became interested game due fact sleep sisters brothers walk naked emperor liked opportunity become emperor ordinary count lead crusade conquer nearest countries maintaining order current empire achieving various goals easily one entertaining games recent years course best game years come fantastic start significantly lower barrier entry compared easy get ingame encyclopedia system also fantastic dont know pdx games gone far without onemajor improvements areas notably graphics ui diplomaticdynastic interactions fairly limited compared fully expansion packed thats expected think given brand new title havent performance issues game seems place demand gpu would expected type game probably optimisation thing nothing really concerned good start hope keeps getting better often see sequel popular expanded upon game would expect release less content previous entry crusader kings iii defies expectation taking best features previous entry expansions adding base game start get amount content youre used well whole bunch new exciting featureseverything lifestyles indian subcontinent customizable religions randomized starts many features carried addition changes traits work makes characters come alive ruler longer arbitrarily imprison rivals without penalty may risk mental breakdown going sense justiceon user experience side everything seems improvement well ui easy navigate contains plenty tooltips explanations different actions traits terms mean youre doubt theres massive encyclopedia right fingertips help outthis one times ill gladly heartily recommend paradox interactive game launch day oh paradox exploit love history oh boy oh boy game amazingive waiting years years yeah also great plenty things however crusader kings feels like charactercentered game focus mostly playable ruler contrary crusader kings managed achieve slight shift dynastycentered perspective yes youll finally able remember least part court family game constantly gives events least one courtier presentedcharacter portraits dynamic genetics plays bigger role plus know way interesting look different faces poses body proportions portraits also like refined relationships system made game world livelier place finally going around making bunch friends rivals even wife kids concubines random dude thing example one rulers daughters managed befriend half brothers sisters made rivals siblingsmoreover traits characteristics dynamic making everyones personalities well maybe one kind least adds diversity roleplay value plus things stress dread parameters contribute overall experiencemy complaint armies seem bit broken especially ai part allies enemies forces sometimes dont want help battles even though united army way stronger opponents also sometimes ai route logic gets broken allysenemys army stuck thinking whether embark noteven though game certain bugs still great optimization wonderful cpu isnt powerful suggest use however game still works fine gameplay many content initial release else dream well maybe lack glitterhoof upsetting oh dear sweet heavenly godthis great attitude user friendly easy understand easy learn makes roleplaying evil king much fun still murder family members seduce lords wives daughters start bloody religion cause mayhem middle ages cant wait good folks acertain website get work famous mods would always play oh good alright itll get better oh manits awesome bit easier crusader kings still much funi really scetchy getting preorder im glad delivered ejoyable experiencei really like craft dynasty like instead playing premade randomized dynasties working count duke point given playstyle start crafting dynasty want look likehope see new dlc promised preorder especially ones change stuff import stuff maybe oh god thought game one thing something else completely wasted money big time one eventhough dont like maybe others think im spoiled total war series oh eu another game cant stop playing days completely addictive completely genius buy like grand strategy wont get better oh yeah big brain time oh yeah good stuff ok first wanna say played lot paradox games played imperator wait game start prosprosi like legacy system helps maintain dynasty set traitsi like buildings system including duchy buildingsi like limit duchy titles limits vassals helps keep giving kingdom titles early gamei like outremer eventsi like english culture event works comparison like addition areas map makes hopefuli personally like focus combat rpg needs developed furtherconsi think inheritance byzantine empire makes start easyi dont like igta done away perhaps havent played enough yet get helpsi would like see culture events feel something game could better also something found lacking imperator historically gauls merged roman culture making subculture byzantine restoration culture events would intriguing toothe realize harder context game im suggesting events muslim latin origin cultures possibly even franconian root culturei would love see china map game would make playing uyghurs etc interestingchallengingi would love see start like game brings release im eager see goes dlc mods havent tried character designer yet lot like comparison feel resistance certain engines different ive played hours wont able say whether change clan inheritance opposed iqta change experience ok straight stupid decent chance winning actually amazing chance start one allies completely ran enemies ally came one allies decent chance winning ally backed last second committed already died finally started moving war score went ally sent decent sized force wasnt gonna make time lost war game stupid spent time converting entire court astru convert another religion dont loose land cost piety convert back screw really enjoying made coven may struggling bit expanding point power means start expanding soon beg fix game plain stupid ok quick review kind game lost inside hours even know much time past also plenty mod support currently growing add cross play people use xbox game pass mods makes fun way ignore ok heres full verdictassuming know drill come paradox perspective familiar etc awesome immersion awesome graphics awesome mechanics lots fornication first time make good use allies awesome version effort comparable say guns n roses first album looking forward whats coming next minor annnoyances raising armies bit chore raise deraise ones dont need mid late game challenges get army size rest world smoked thats defo start small ransom fees prisoners sometimes dont correspond collect fixed surely religious orders useless pay never get use religious reformations supposed big deal upside adding women recruitment pool imho big waste time effort crusade victory points outbalance win big lose big otherwise crusades compelling max crown authority vassals able battle appearently enemy friendly armies could outlined bit clearertop tip try jarl haesteinn montaigue second start date supposed easy youll find make parallel history invading england brittany stead normandy tough challenge rewarding course iron man go full nerd renaming french places nordic names mythology much better ok followed debugging steps letter still game auto save regularly crashes ireland easy mode system memory beyond exceptional game plenty gigs left saving literally dropped pants far security goes everything shutdown running steam admin unfortunately one person asking refund even though think would enjoy game little time able play repeatedly start one case developer rushed product market prior testing externally shame would also like add negative difficulty finding contacts trouble shooting steam also made sure steam program drive gigs available restarting system approximately times run windows online community support seen issue sure heck cant get touch developers help developers yes run least times file validation via steam found nothing wrong along deleting reinstalling multiple times executables ok im gonna keep short youre strategies new paradox games give least hours fun youre pdx veteran see years finally make game mechanically rich add needed flavor roleplay options ok better ckii hope keep steering ship right ok lets clear far less content expect fully fleshed game must disappoint said fun game nonetheless see lot potential ok played hours hours nowthis certainly mean expert anything like feel know somewhat talking aboutthe review contain ins outs opinion wether endorse gamealtho lots changed average understanding troubles understanding play played problems heard actual tutorial explaining stuffthe information provided guiis pretty much focussed newcomers seriesoverall say game complete hope get attentionquality got free updates dlcspersonally really enjoy game uninstalled favor game gets upvote ok initial review ill update later drastically change mind later onfirst biggest improvement like game use wasd keys navigate around map small thing wow difference second lot elements streamlined fixed improved game good exampe combat lane bs improving army numbers composition new focus system allows much better control character last gamehowever biggest change game level immersion feel playing playing character need keep mind traits get stressed resulting negative debuffs trait choices also make much larger difference interacting people good example lunatic sin catholic religion results everyone else judging even worse interact tons ways immersion improved favorite part game overall liked like graphically roughly shiner coat paint would probably rate game amazing definitely worth sticker price game okay hours campaigns time brief review hours first impression looks kinda nice guess oh didnt put ships really uh button uh really raise troops like thisby third game though love first two games short refiguring mechanics bit since played want paint map pretty easy experienced easily got empires control third game could gone chasing achievements ill go pros areas improvement arent cons cause know dlc come themtop pros simplicity didnt overcomplicate raising troops put ships game start first upset base game actually done really smooth way grapics could use touching map modes things generally good dont lag game much like afraid talent trees absolutely love crazy strong talents leave figure every tree seems useful things depending play style certainly found ones cater mebiggest room naval combat really must balance raise troops sit someones cities go war certain situations character story seem kind like get disputed heritage trait never select extramaritial affair end game screen end game screen made feel epic good game told bit story feel like lot work could go screen tell story rulers rise fall compare dynasties game okay first time playing series kept seeing popping site time long time civilization fani couldnt help think wouldnt like comparing two finally pulled trigger got whim launch hours addicting hours see mass amount content available cant help feel receive treatment modsmanso many great ones already game well put together cant say ive encountered bugs interface easy use ive read isnt easy navigate new game fixed expect city world building game like civilization wont find find basically medieval politics simulator war slight city improvements depths upon depths political intrigue marry brothers wife marry daughter keep blood lines strong throw son jail plot murder rival many random options game hours ive scratched surface okay crusader kings somewhat breaks trend paradox game releases barebones unfinished fully featured strategy game add dlc later really need flesh little things base game satisfy youi think game slightly casualised coming thats okay really try play like dont get handholding drop menu tells everything works endless tooltips ingame encyclopedia explain anything need know flash issues even people love game think mostly eliminates youre pro heck dunno maybe dont really need game remind fiftieth time go make friends dude dude thats cool turn interface better think time still perfect still struggles show vast quantities data game already struggling show times cant imagine like navigate get around dlc even mods inevitably add menus characters scripted otherwise interact think needs work maybe better scaling options change scale various elements gui parts gui absolutely need compressed worked least display sometimes screen gets cluttered stuff little annoyingfighting better think manatarms system able train units effectively like normal strategy game lot warmongering folks like want able build guys comes type games come rts background first foremost always bugged really get dirt shovel button gives levies thats get hope vassals like organise regiments trained soldiers quality quantity boot good system like constant upkeep means little nations wont really able field vast quantities professional soldiers later youre willing invest enough punch levy weight speak quality units think good systemim like many hours game think comes spending gold difficult tell good investment many different projects want money could save various titles clear really help could save buildings give clear benefits little difficult understand things like gold per tick thats easy get something like light footmen toughness light footmen damage little tougher really get feel part dont really see numbers behind combat theres things like holy orders pilgrimages things still better technology system whatever called fascinations kind weird whoever stands top culture gets decide tech research seemingly random exposure random techs drives along first foremost cant tell whats exactly optimal get like bonus random tech exposure bonus anything choose long youre culture leader system seems okay techs obviously much much better others primogeniture instance simplifies succession may even make game easy whereas others simply give new manatarms unit buff existing ones think fine anywayi didnt spend much seems kind absurd good incest ancestry perks get permanent crazy bonuses succession positive traits maluses continuation negative traits bloodline kind nuts feel like youd pretty frequently get hit inbreeding penalties deformities doesnt seem common game filter bad stuff keep good stuff havent seen yet im pretty sure theres also specific blueblood trait keeping bloodline pure ancestry general bunch various strong perks permanent bonuses various things caught eye capacity make every member lineage better everything thats pretty strongthe graphics general pretty appealing think good job sticking realistic art style one things bugs certain games like civilization sickening drop cartoony caricatures im glad didnt fall trap really much say front since know paradox strategy game theres whole lot going terms models stuff actually least fully character models stand backgrounds stuff cool idea think variations appearance good enough differentiate characters one another time good stuffnot much say sound either guess musics okay mostly good atmospheric stuff theres tune plays time something big happens short like theme crusades long might even like minute music kinda weird finish reading dialogue box press ok still going later youre trying build motte something think sound effects better mentioned earlier dirt shovel sound levies fortunately fixed doesnt sound like youre plant crops backyard whateverits unbelievable tutorial actually works game unlike feel free give try feel necessary make start king murchad munster think beat tutorial game keeps going good one suggestions people reddit offered new players learn game since tutorial nonfunctional hey actually pretty good start feel like game engineered get taste everything get take little bit territory unify small country even specific steps progression greatuhhh could go basically pretty good satisfied many levels direct upgrade opinion okay game ridiculously easy want steamroll map without real difficulty yeah get game otherwise wait harder difficulty releasedalso playing years finally getting end game thing happens screen says end button go back main menu literally thats option look back expanded realm ruler ruler possibility retrospect honestly unsatisfying launch feels bit personal grounded also seems fair realistic became dlc releases diseases much chore get demon spawn assassinate entire family immortal lunatics aztec invasionsplenty refined mechanics like love disinherit disown seduce romance options happy way culture religion conversion give timer tech tree much better set spymaster spy stuff instead steal tech world like way new council jobs works rpg elements make feel attached characters weaker dynasty members still survive awhile careful attention choices like personalize holdings building choices overall happy still nice meta humor like tinder parody stuff interface audio much polished game doesnt take much space runs fine early starts could use balancing though best stategy games ive played really hard understand game hero release game everything made good reworked mechanics used bad new paint graphical coat could easily run whit mid tier pc long youre imaginitive enough set goals playing game worth buy paradox title made exeptional dlc likely come form later first day came played hours straight whole really fun game enjoyed time spent game felt like ai behaves like reasonable simulations individuals exception person wouldnt vote elected king instead preferred idiot uncle whole would give thumbs uplike many paradox games issues clear communication consequences instance ended walking away ireland play enacted tanist elective succession expected keep realm together expense able choose heir nope realm still went kids didnt get groom heir idiot uncle became next line held together election became clear minor count votes dynasty household head new king decided achieved
