figure youre war love piece land comes notification highlighted clicking doesnt give idea thing dejure system core aspect game based around idea modern titles didnt really exist game starts makes difficult expand organically two neighboring counties may share duchy worse two neighboring duchies may share kingdom need make vassals happy limits make sense iceland instance county others make sense historical hindsight iceland part kingdom norway kingdom scotland possible get around extensive work council inheritance breaks game paradox title fun paradox title playing game building empire army guys really fun start new game build four counties directly control die lands get split among heirs nominally retain control one holding weak vassal isnt fun spent hours building empire longer get benefits compounds first problem example hold two duchies adjacent arent kingdom didnt get absurd amount gold needed make kingdom early game die suddenly control one duchyi think theyll fix menus
