ill honest havent played since crazyness like well worth timemoney everything added years lol im little late well worth coming back support title oh im sorry came looking gameplay review dont one tf hasnt played terraria well remember much better much fin ill perfectly honest first saw game youtube didnt really think looked interesting fun honestly forgot altogether couple years ago looked back change opinion game decided give try little know would become one played games everwhat makes terraria special well first relogic company created game actually gives crap fans game created evident fact theres content games price dlc slap face absolutely none sure soundtrack appears dlc list game theres honestly point getting unless want show even support developers im definitely sure im going pointbut said isnt great response developers makes game stand also includes progression system perfect combination progression fun activities although going entire game couple days fun fact choose either build hearts content explore every single area world fight every enemy game wish honestly werent perfect blend progression things well wouldnt nearly many hours game nowwhat really makes game opinion one best games ive ever played fact modding communitys extremely active assure therell something thatll spice experience whether something simple reduced grinding way complete overhaul game altogether theres something everyone enjoyhonestly money youve read interests highly recommend game got bugs fun gameplay variety different features thatll keep coming ill first admit came game expecting minecraft got much differentterraria although shares core mechanics minecraft mining crafting building blockbased terrain things share terraria focuses adventure side randomly generated worlds providing vast amount content explore tiny pricethe downside think would grind early game grind endgame early game weak mob poses threat takes bit get past endgame starts focus less crafting one amazing item drop rate youre okay minor complaints rest sounds good totally try game ill give person finds better game ill go back edit review later overall good game recieved casual gift time flat ended becoming wrapped game theres end content explore even beat game update still found rare mount drops hard obtain pets guardian pet ways challenge course strong enough freely build replayability game pretty good world generate unique come either crimson corruption course import seeds opposite kind world another one plant later joined hallow update even lower levels alot content

rewards going different areas locations often really exciting feeling opening chest shrine temple getting really good piece armour really good weapon amazing crafting system incredible well somewhat complicated well made making incredibly enjoyable farm certain resources something kill certain enemies particular item searching underground materials make something completely exceeds crafting systems many games makes even funand many places things arent often found wont give spoilers quite locations things didnt know world exciting find themthe combat system terraria really good well dimensional often quite intense doesnt involve spamming one item constantly leftclicking kill enemy boss requires decent level precision skill often many different items used different points boss

grindy played single player deffinitely recommend playing friends multiplayer makes great game chill sandboxy youd like focus adventure goals great game get entire game group play hours end little something every kind gamer low system requirements simple complicated want confusing new players great sandbox game hard play awesome game intimidating game stable comfortable work pace kind slow singleplayer multiplayer blast pretty complex advanced first friend knows shes great pretty lit friends tedious times high action parts super fun tons ways play really fun friends wonderfully soothing times thoroughly rageinducing others right reasons terraria work art doubt mind get rather monotonous times materials really stuff real fun begins get addictive super fun whilist playing friends playing singleplayer tad bit boring much explore discover much get every item example one strongest melee weapons called meowmere rare drop defeating moonlord around extremly fun look like underwhelming game first glance equip little copper sword slimes meteors land demons get slain bosses become mechanized aliens invade defend magic death scythes sniper rifles great game comes mind never reviewed gameive playing since one thenfriends convinced preorder itif enjoy building creating especially large scale terraria capture almost immediately combat bosses mightthe game lowspec even terrible computer years ago could probably run albeit slowdowns newer intense fights short cheapit could run potatoit looks nicetheres lot doboss fights latergame actually pretty challengingbuilding tools really intensive get themnot perfect much price many games would offer nice cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool guess cost bucks waiting thats absolute steal something amount content would strongly recommend game pretty much anyone could confusing first get hang super addictive also play friends making even fun could use fixes patches add spells abilities weapons armor bosses maybe thats needs already besides good game crashed title screen looks promising im still gonna recommend crashes automatically name charecter waste since made review got good computer setup could play game fun expansive minecraft definitely one best games youll ever playa bang buck without doubt deleted literally everything friend absolutely reason please dont get game unless like losing days worth progress deserves least game paying game way better price says good game doe fun fun doe fun tho good tho good tho good though kinda fun doe like get kind boring quickly play repetitively especially

game started looking found actually quite welldefined progression form bossfights except immediately obvious handholding player set specific goals go usually involves getting specific gear would allow player survive subsequently reaching areas bosses finally trying fight themi would say opinion bossfights really best part game even best gear could get point time one felt challenging unique got great sense accomplishment upon emerging victorious also defeat boss quickly enabled access new gear immediately made feel powerful sense character progression strong going game gathering gear fighting also eventually started decorating house spending quite lot time usually sell items craft potions wanted look nice visiting kind took bit surprise initially intentions addressing sorts things guess game kinda pulled yeah unique monsters mechanics great sense progression plenty items discover many strategies try imagine even youre looking something relaxing could nice focus building house shaping environment around game something everyone feels like roguelike progression runs theres run progression runs ive seen lategame videos guess theres progression eventually seriously dont

sword shield get set ranger armor gearthe world explore absolutely packed content even smallest world setting spend hours exploring fighting bosses entirely open ended feel like digging straight underworld taking wall flesh within first minutes starting new world go right around dont expect get far unless really know youre whether simply want beat bosses goals like collecting boss masks
