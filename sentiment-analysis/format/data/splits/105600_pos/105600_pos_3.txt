really lets choose want ot make beatiful masterpieces fight hordes enemies huge array weapons go exploring random massive worlds say game bit confusing upon starting looking intro info watching someone play early stages game make much enjoyable figure cannot overall think entirely worth full price bought game awhile back early played four hours next day got would work deleted today downloaded crashes opens sometimes says please open steam client opening steam client solution please message also thank god works think good game bad time itedit finally got work played really enjoying itedit crashed wont start really stupid gameedit yes tried nothing happened bought game back even hardmode update many hours got costed dollars back still costs dollars today times content release looking game progression easily dozen objects items looking pure number items even quarter purely furniture game hits niche definitely worth dollarsaesthetics release day got still get better better every update cant think single offputting graphic game speaking actual graphics though everything well pictures say game lacking graphicallycombat fun engaging game go game plenty battle ai ranging fighters walk towards trying touch slimes hop around try launch flying ai worm ai caster plant bat swimming many giving unique battles every enemy encounter fly walls others charge head teleport others cast spells direction lot going try ram one way another abilities ways attacking feels rare ever come across clone enemy despite many enemies use fighter ai bosses ai unique couple remixes early bosses later game using similar ai however unique way fighting universal strategy works smart usage certain blocks mechanicsequipment armour accessories also give unique bonuses either wearing entire set armour equipping accessory one accessory slots everything flying dashing petals shoot crystal even beign able summon sand tornadoes stealth invisibilit defense enemy aggression bases covered itd easier list dont give wide array equipmentmusic great gets better later areas though thats personal taste opinion get chance listen soundtrack boss themes fitting get pumped kill monster magnificient proportions area themes also nice also fitting considering contextcrafting bit slow scrolling list looking massive wall items craft various components inventory may bit tiresomemining full encounters monster ranging slimes skeletons glowing bats change based underground biome youre wont even need mine many minerals anyways times find mining need iron lead need get hardmode ores upcoming boss also many secrets hidden underground profitable search time spend underground spent looking said items anywaysthere fishing quests catching fish game sometimes youre lucky move quickly times takes half day catch one fish need cna get crates provide valuable loot type crates change depending biome youre providing biome specific items may gotten chests even fill dungeon water find locked crates opened keys inhabitants drop like find locked cheststhere many options building game taking moments look player creations definitely inspiringthe game moddable arent many mods

terraria much adventure focused fighting giant bosses getting unique loot many enemies minecraft hand much building oriented easily equipped variety game styles like parkour hunger games play friends personally prefer playing single player terraria mostly tend progress slow pace ame includes many different playstyles melee mage summoner ranger mixed yoyo user also combined melee playing group people different abilities playstyles fun let cover endstheres ton little references game enjoy links tunic statue allows spawn unicrons resembling knight piece chess literal portal gundespite pixelated game really nice look later game armors really flashy cool bosses look kind scary gross like giant rotted worm creature lot eyes nice friendly npcs get look unique enemies also get variations depending location world like raining zombies wear raincoats youre ice biome wear parkas dont know whether love despise music ive listening years feel like im going slightly mad every time hear overworld day music time nostalgic hell bad song none songs hossible opinion really match locations belong think favorite vanilla track corruption almost sassy vibe opnion really shouldnt work plague infested land also solar eclipse music great like classic horror organ music mixed technoey style makes sense probably doesnt heres link httpsrelogicbandcampcomtrackeclipsealso think playing normal difficutly setting easy play expert mode makes enemies bosses much harder also provides new awesome loot pair hardcore mode make challenge even greater hardcore character dies get deleted perfect masochist softcore characters lose money die normal core dont actually know thats right word lose items like minecraftso yeah variety weapons playstyles cute references nice looking decent music variety different difficulty settings player expeirence level dont think theres anything really dislike terraria give always game come back know many hours people game leave review due fact played game console probably long minecraft switching pc lets get reviewmy thoughtsamazing game personally see better minecraft dont get wrong ive spent thousands hours minecraft always one top games game superior many many ways main reason much content game compared minecraft items bosses compared minecraft minecraft mere items bosses terraria items bosses version bosses thats youre thing similar minecraft game doesnt big learning curve much beginner friendly games replayability factor around minecraft even though sidescroller still artistic artistic youre builds pixel art mention sound design game phenominal everything background music digging exploring sound effects every enemy find come across along digging doesnt get boring like minecraft occasional underground structure chest minecart track appear every come across things like trap shoot poison dart poison killing low health mining ores never really gets boring either always come across new ores gems progress game stop coming across new ores time happens hardmode going talk exception right hundreds new ores spread across youre world giving new life mining usually mining finding diamonds nothing new like minecraft mining
