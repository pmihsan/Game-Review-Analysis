worth really merrier game good godlike must one best games ever played regretted sinking many hours endless creativity new things explore especially modding scene overall unforgettable enjoyable experience someone pointed review horrible might well stop diking around give actual review yes hours game reccommending gothe presentation presentation includes everything music graphics general atmosphere music although heavily subjective didnt leave lasting impact felt lighthearted game massive terraria wasnt unbearable little desired graphics another story someone could argue also subjective looking character sprites items even backgrounds cases look much uglier traditional retro games plenty variation artstyles ranging dark intimidating colorful fun like minecraft sprite artworks enough inspiration behind become generic pixelarts aside bosses block designs atmosphere game achieves goal overall goal underwhelming start doesnt take long get bored youre looking gameplay gameplay encompasses everything controls combat building anything else game would one thing would praise terraria controls fluid easy handle combat surprisingly addicting wont long get proper sword begin adventure jumping mountains batting away slimes throughout game impressive variety weapons matched games everything swords bows staves spellbooks lightsabers bombs personal favorite guns easily best part game leveling system playstyle solely dependent gear means one playstyle isnt working equip different set tools armor get job done also plethora baddies fight attack unique ways mining also nonhassle thanks able see walls since plane mining potions also make easy spot important ores potions help progress game much easier one complaint gameplay lack boss attack types however lack preplanned setpieces story whatsoever makes quite bland doesnt neccessarily make bosses bad could bit creative progression point go loving game giving hours lemme start saying game progression underworlds wall flesh oops spoilers fantastic gear progression feels natural game never forces anything aside occasional goblin invasion guide give advice everything else world ripe conquering whatever order want feel like exploring jungle go ahead wanna enter dungeon guest want overwhelm slimes bees one stopping best part bosses dungeons enemies underworld optional want head straight wall flesh second night yrimir style things go south spirits light dark get released game enters hardmode things get tough game goes giving freedom whatever wanted giving gigantic todo list slap face dont obligatory time limit first problem spread corruption crimson hallow spreads fast spawns fairly difficult enemies unless get filth quarantined asap important biomes could completely obliterated including ones neccesary beat game invasions happen completely randomly unless make castle sky npcs bound die even started hardmode absolutely nothing right thats fair progression also goes open world game becoming much linear upon entering hardmode already preset path go making following playthroughs exciting could beat three mechanical bosses go jungle fight plantera yes go jungle temple beat golem matter class play must things exact order best part hardmode progressionwise dungeon since even wof nothing ever forces dungeon want loot gear otherwise skip entirely playthroughs theres also events nice touch games progression somehow feel alien terrarias theme instead feel like combat minigame sorts instead exploration discovery combat alone makes terraria terraria secondary exploration buiding offer overall progression quite disappointing wish optional bosses dungeons bring back made prehardmode terraria great rng made competely seperate section one small detail perhaps worst part game dont care say randomness games frusturating mariokart dokapon kingdom even super smash bros rng primary secondary gameplay element games understand rng dumb make unpredictability come fun part games game like terraria rng lazy overly angering nothing stall player pad game session good example goblin tinkerer npc pay enough money change quality toolweapon completely random also downgraded ends happening spend money trying get best quality weapon end nothing casinos get money terraria videogame one wins spend platinum coins end crap quality tactical shotgun rng plagues almost every aspect game aforementioned events boss spawning enemy loot drops boss loot drops even biome generation stated earlier corruption destroy entire jungle even fair example play melee class beaten plantera get magic weapons cant even use kill thing ranged weapon summoner weapon attempts get seedler awful quality decide fix tinkerer gives bad qualities gives subpar one decide f trigger pumpkin moon event recieve candy corn rifles raven staves horsemans blade actually happened point started realize dumb excuse plenty enemies creatures game could drop weapons consistently least crafting components fact enemies dont even drop anything worthwhile except occasional accessory vanity item drop chump change useless material fuck wouldnt reccommend terraria fun timewaster sure compare games youll quickly see flaws realize much better dollarsverdict stupid big lag thanks terraria first person action rpg follows storyline starwars serise play luke skywalker journey starwars main story line combat repeptitive like shooting games story sad made cry times overall mainly story recomoned terraria get thgrough combat rpg mechanics also pretty solid terraria fun game normal mode least go expert mode medium core becomes dark souls everything wanting rape perfect score first thing would like mention review youll probably seeing negative reviews based around bad luck mechanic due using incorrect torches incorrect biomes reviews outdated developers listened community feature removed relatively quickly npc happiness people complaining mostly optional feature get benefits utilizing theres real negative except slightly increased shop pricesif youre considering purchase game reviews like making less motivated ignore reviewers people trouble adjusting mindset theyve years refusing accept enjoy new features latest major update broughtive playing game years point recommended everyone would listen game least platforms enjoyed extremely openness experience sure theres general progression follow bosses better gear general anything want many features paths explore almost certainly wont explore one run additionally added challenges expert master mode difficult also present new items use different way ever want easier experience way play peace without worry frequent deaths progression setbacks even want play difficult settings ability easily create elaborate builds without harvest several worlds journey mode perfect gives enemy spawn rate sliders godlike abilities control ingame difficulty weather time even prevent getting damaged also introduces way duplicate items findif isnt enough access massive modding community thousands mods add tons new content bosses quality life ect adds hundreds hours replayability new content special features dont terraria would highly recommend game terraria super fun interactive game think interactive much stuff possible game things find would really recommend others option reason picked game first place dirt cheap last

defeating boss underworld youll feel like noob work past game feels like truly begins items game pretty rare rares used craft otherwise obtain best loot game thought play friends find people run game much fun way still enjoy quite bit single player however cant laugh someone gets destroyed boulder trapstory time want torture read ramblingi bought game ages ago back still development expansions cleanups gone spent thissince dev team least back kept would post threads month least let people know planned progress game kept getting updated adding content mechanics remember super excited new weapon types added rare mounts added accessories character fly around map gimme something always admire relogic simply focus adding stuff end game kept polishing early game adding things like ropes make things easier get hookshots simple versions weapons find later like spears wooden yoyo early game magic items used much less enjoyable slower grind get mid game content pace picks upthere least couple times development game supposedly going halt satisfied id gotten content enjoyment terraria games id bought yet somehow maybe year hearing nothing new content update would surprisingly pushed happened least twice thought would laid rest spent even start game well first amazingly expansive game many great features make people love sandbox games although still structure story progression negative way cool way letting get used many classes equipment move next tier common settle class run even reach end game isnt downsides unique interesting playstyles work different types people summoner someone great dodging attacks lower armor damage coming minions warrior pretty easy normal mellee weapon whether sword mace even yoyo still high defense focus attack wizard best unique ways attacking whether shower fallen stars magic missile sometimes interesting staff like staff discord teleports character short distance finally last vanilla class ranger class utilizes array bows guns even rocket launcher along high dexterity movement speed stay enemies way class talk isnt say cant mix match warrior summoned minion cover back ranger massive sword dodging isnt enough lot configurability real reason move class minmaxxing stats another note game lot combat adventure also thriving building aspect almost expansive minecraft thousands different building blocks collect throughout world craft many resources build majestic castle cybertronic lab basement modern sky bridges thing limits imagination free time another awesome aspect game isnt specifically related developers third part modloader name tmodloader extension game adds replayability terms content also adds features might suit community person choose want play want game hardcore crazy mods ko modes whether bosses mod adds supply demand npcs cant sell demonite low cash mod adds mod adds ability explore wheat drops craft certain crafted boss drop etc put shortly type content really enhance base game way makes game developers look lazy lets choose game way like terms replayability also awesome played terraria times vanilla times modded would say pretty stellar game lthough might want breaks

farms etc building system definitely contains everything little bit morenext comes adventuringcave exploringmining part im gonna honest game definitely finished within hours hell probably wont finish first run hours reason caving terribly slow cave generation bit meh often youll spend time mining one cave another till find big cave lot loot even usually runs mining adventuring part definitely become grindy finding specific items pain ass said mining specific ores although experienced player know mining basic ores copper tungsten iron something really dont need means theres bit dead content especially items youll find whilst opening chests going useless minutes bit shameon fightingbosses bit yeah say movement smooth bosses run smooth offer different challenging fights depending boss youre fighting different stages game also offer new loot enemies progress making game necessarily easier despite unlocking lot luxury accessories wings theres hundreds different weapons dozens different armours go mage go gunrunner go swordman flailman jojoman doesnt matter even mix time makes refined easy understand smooth fun fighting system start getting better youll definitely start enjoying fights much bosses game theres definitely lack fights either since defeat progress game could ramble another paragraphs mechanics game theres need important points adressed game definite

notice bigger differences terraria starting become adventure game minecraft stayed sandbox games like minecraft adds new content bosses items never felt fulfilling go beyond anything stacked couple diamonds terraria ive driven bosses times less week feeling im coming back completely new game major updates content adding like put innow game hasnt always top favorites ill admit things prefer starbound minecraft terraria overall charm execution matters opinion terraria wellfirst youre cast world knowing nothing survive fun learning world make make different things easily available items explore discover events eye chthulu watching pirate invasion coming west feel like world really alive around youas progress creating thriving base npcs harvesting materials resources need start taking interesting challenging bosses even taking bosses purpose games farming bosses gather items resources especially sandbox games nonlinear story true progression system terraria rightonce defeat certain bosses hints thrown next progression even though use wiki lot enjoyed game felt like discovered something new every timewhen first introduced hardmode game could hardly believe convinced game abandoned would recieve work stated earlier statement given devsbut game finished went threw hardmode could kill toughest boss youd meet prehm offering stressfull good way challenge edge seat run opposite direction get mauled bossonce defeated light darkness cast upon world theres new biomes items gather explore first time managed beat last boss overwhelmed new biomes felt like playing different game finally got used managed build way best gear could gather opinion adventure kinda stopped played times creativethen introduced came back game yet find much new content added ready get new stuff ive already finished end boss moon lord pretty much gathered items weapons want still dont feel like lost adventurous drive came sudden halt two timesin conclusion would like say developers work game done amazing theyve delivered us free new content far exceeds price tag deserve good mark done something indie industry anymore give us game allwhile wont name developersgames many steals money early access promises never follows thats think extra important know game completely worth itconsidering long game free content added long feels pretty refreshing tldr like minecraft fully destructable coop craftingexplorations game simplified graphics unlike minecraft lot content discover equipment craft enemies fight including long chain epic boss fights corruption mechanic overrun entire world dont thwart world may smaller lacking third dimension game equally amazing obvious competitor cost terraria fully destructable voxel pixel context game crafting sounds lot like minecraft doesnt comparison appropriate terraria surpasses minecraft lot ways minecraft scrimps pregenerated elements focus general exploration many chunks pregenerated structures even fewer epic boss fights terraria doubles elaborate dungeons especially boss encounters minecraft boss encounters basically limited ender dragon wither ocean temple boss terraria least dozen bosses point quite differentiated games allow wide creative building structures terraria almost order magnetude building options gear craft benefit relatively lower effort pixel art vs modeling texturing extra variety locales gear enemies adds much deeper feeling game despite one less dimension simply put terraria everything minecraft writ small also excels combatdont get wrong minecraft also excellent game terraria equally ambitious successful games supported nearly unprecidented timeframes come long way humble beginnings cost single copy minecraft could copies terraria sometimes since terraria sometimes goes sale minecraft never tldr new features dont outweigh fixing old problems try learn triumphs failures games see make one truly shinei got game long time ago reinstalled come back journeys end im disappointed things didnt change combat frenetic unfair single player incredibly boring frustrating multiplayer still doesnt work well ive tried get multiplayer work properly dozens hours used different computers mac windows multiplayer often refuses connect client needs restarted many times get work finally makes connection doesnt last frequent disconnects made worse fact game doesnt seem allow join game steam menu need invite works join game either connect drop connection midgame ive fiddled new bells whistles journey mode item duplication weather sliders well difficulty management amusing took long ability change difficulty without making whole new map original design flaws game play still mentioned clear lot effort went game desperately needed optimization fun multiplayer balance changes extra features new items additional difficulties mean nothing fun part doesnt worknow cant compare starbound similar feel itemization terraria much better games standard head chest legs armor slots accessory slots customize character much unique starbounds single epp mod chip really like terraria ability fly ironic character starbound landbound multiplayer starbound atable latency ludicrous terrarias multiplayer feels like cooperating latency much less said starbound better combat bosses fun face construction starbound vastly superior feels like exploration creativity focus terraria feels like building tacked npcs somewhere stay patch notes journeys end looks like might tried change sad state multiplayer never got see thing really seals starbounds supremacy map generation terraria always theres always two beaches dungeon temple ect feels like map every time locations different change corruption vs crimson even basically thing different colour scheme starbound many planets every one different different landmarks theres towns life many worlds different races distinct settlements make standout rest theres dungeons temples greater variety theres dungeons prisons towers castles mausoleums planet overarching biome also minibiomes break landscape obviously theres limit much random map generator make takes far longer starbound run unique maps terraria realistically one getting around starbound easier since planet isnt massively wide terraria map get want quicker using ship also drop teleporters anywhere starbound theyll options terraria

random direction come across place cant enter new goal come across something absolutely kicks behind know need strive towards imagination get work coming clever death trap sidestep intended course progress find resource cant yet mine use trythe game doesnt tell anything frustrating things impossible happen upon thoughbuilding stuff game feels rewarding vast amounts materials use even combined different materials find exploring world youll need base operations many things construct place qualityoflife improvements well might want create certain biome manually might want create easeoftravel paths across map create sophisticated machinery quite like minecraft certainly enough impress friends game rewards ingenuity design bosses huge mark games favour cornerstone genre terraria blows competition water regardthere much content easily spend fifty hours ingame never end stuck without anything course since game narrative times needing look advance next stage game heavily luckbased whether youll stumble upon summoning boss well whether recognize summoned main strike game however also standard genre goes minecraft starbound crea edge space empyrion savage lands stark contrast games terraria amazingly good job keeping busy stages game want exploring new loot find new biome craft new item found return boss kicked behind earlier get materials home base theres actual qualitative content spend time mindless digging minerals therell hardly hour something isnt happening around sets game leagues apart minecraft starboundthe difficulty game incredibly engaging ranging

teleporting enemies traps dangerous terrain toes youll die lotthematically game flies directions starts medieval fantasy tell expansion patches take sometimes jarring switches theme isnt terrible though game doesnt really try go pure fantasy setting jarring sure doesnt detract overall experience majority game still fantasythe three major points contetion game firstly random events secondly randomness items thirdly map either corruption crimsonthe random events first welcome change pace give access loot give challenge especially play expert mode spice otherwise straightforward progression however never stop youre endgame preparing final boss facepalm super annoying event occurs three straight nights row id like see earlier random events stop reach certain thresholds perhaps get really arbitrary whilethe problem wealth items terraria want everything theres many chests map want catch em youll need create new maps run loot everything im sure thats good thing bad something keep mindlastly game utilizes randomization creating map terms deciding type certain biome dire consequences later line cant change biome type far know apart manually removing every block type manually replacing second type would gather another randomly generated map even think original map would kind confused want get achievements youll play around types biomei highly recommend terraria

scattered done way thats based pretty much entirely randomization find world spawn many different types items picks swords axes materials armour different accessories give character attributesyou either craft specific ones right materials majority time youre going either get items random enemies kill chests find caves mean progression scattered early game youre likely going spend time gathering right materials allow head caves look cheststhis likely game want play guide open times game offers little terms handholding good cases vast amount things tied progression game youre going need research spawn beside guide spout random facts clear order show material craft isnt helpful considering amount things need knowi something around hours game recently learned game turns sort classbased boss rush game clue earlygame endgame vastly different one another real clear inbetween transition one biggest gripes game considering intensely game changes slower paced fairly relaxing occasional tough enemy thrown way suddenly youre riding wingeddemon beast minions sword shoots black holes good way shows much game tooons materials weapons accessories etc friends nearly thousand hours game still learning new stuff however also confusing doesnt introduce mechanics pretty much leaves figure little hard feel like im earning progression tied finding random things getting luckyid
