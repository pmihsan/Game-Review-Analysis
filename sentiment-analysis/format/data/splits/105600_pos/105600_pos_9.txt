text lot good memories playing game mainly playing friends since played know quite bit added since really dug games type seem balance mainly exploration action construction something like minecraft focussed heavily exploration construction terraria geared towards exploration adventure lots enemies weapons artifacts dungeons bosses etc progression equipment throughout game pretty satisfying helps keep vested interest like others type initially entering game little foreknowledge crafting requirements biomes items etc pretty frustrating discover something new like first crystal heart itll help motivate continue adventuring search overall fun experience perhaps bit lonely single player running small private server friends isnt hard definitely rewarding may postjourneys end revisit addendum

advance want fight cant kill something upright cope ways building walls protect yourselftheres bugs ive really noticed time ive played guess one think one liquid multiplying using pumps otherwise theres nothing really bad music wise every biome different type tune levels different musicambience roam huge environment nice selection sounds relaxing stressful also make music box select tune want controls little intimidating initially figuring options available adjust liking main game wise controlling character pretty simple since jump run around attack things make things looking cons spelunker potion doesnt tell specific ore youre going since lit exactly see light equipped gear well varies lot often doesnt show much map isnt easy useyou basically specific things order able advance easier access areas light caves spelunker ores boots speed jump reach areas without mods able add game except third party sources becomes limited certain aspects without option change things case would like see steam workshop since lot people already made mods game whether game certain zone dont define game since every area different items anyway however option able choose biomesmore customisation case would perfect added content likely would interested seeing new environmental biomes unicornslast least consider terraria keep updating gives lot potential since developers wont

whole point game exploring world collecting many items upgrade player real somewhat major gripe game story lack dont mean game needs deep cinematic story far simply mean inclusion even tiny bit lore text would generally compliment whole experience would nice give general reason youre shame really game amazing creature designs really tries build engaging immersive world personally doesnt bother much however others might deal breaker despite cant say game lacks category ton items game lots types items apparent weapons fight swords bows guns wands spell tomes staffs minions yoyos flails knives explosives even grenade launchers weapons everyone game would meaningless weapons uninspired unoriginal weapons added course years constant game updates every weapon feels unique way separating stats also weapons unique effects lets take possessed hatchet example rapid fire melee weapon thrown kinda like knife much faster unique effect ability home nearest enemy ton variety items game also take

materials craft better items etcif seems boring know terraria finely crafted experience probably wont even notice gameplay loop many playthroughs game parts terraria felt like chore though mileage may vary game doesnt force anything particular youre free play game however like rush game effort reach final boss craft powerful gear take time explore sorts interests build fancy residence shape world deck character go fishing even take part number optional invasionstyle events wont show unless specifically summon said progress game certain things like killing specific bosses make things spawn gain

game still piques interest already spent hundreds hours mining building gearing fighting massive bosses could easily spend hundreds due thriving modding community even though actual developer game updates sparse still continue working new features fixes well porting providing updates console mobile versions game although believe terraria derives inspiration minecraft important distinguish major differences differences much separate terraria genredefining experience terraria large focus gear boss progression beginning progression basic mostly boils digging enough find ores make next tier pickaxe later progression becomes much deeper wide selection options focus magic melee ranged summons take advantage sorts special effects like invisibility even flight certainly items quite useful others massive amount different items choose certainly able create character plays exactly way want youre feeling gap build youve played vanilla terraria many times already easy find massive amount variety items games modding system important incredibly fun part progression terraria boss fights often advance bosses order alongside gear progression gear found crafted exploring world however bosses usually important milestone equipment bosses often drop key components fully functioning items generally prove much powerful anything youd using many bosses much easily defeated using loot obtained previous boss encounters quite enjoy sandbox nature game however certainly comes fairly annoying issue isnt really clear way figure certain things ingame hidden things required progressing get frustrating frustration easily remedied visiting games community wiki covers pretty much anything could want know game playerbase good keeping date browsing wiki isnt appealing several mods make good replacement would highly recommend checking boss checklist quick clear list keeping track bosses youve defeated fight next play randomly generated worlds limited size varying features encouraged bring character across multiple different worlds throughout progression options character customization quite limited character small sprite exploring world fighting hordes monsters bosses gathering loot building homes friendly npcs vanilla experience easily gives hundreds hours play take step bring friends find fun mods easily bring hundreds hours enjoyment interface ui still largely many years gets job done clear familiar youve played minecraft still easy learn get used good amount choices customizing quality life options appreciated default controls work fine playing mouse keyboard good controller support well controls easily rebinded either control scheme pixelart game cant speak much impressiveness graphical fidelity however say game runs well even many monsters particles screen time even though art style somewhat basic done good job creating unique aesthetic theme monsters bosses believe majority people would easily able recognize sprite game even long theyd stopped playing also noted plenty graphical options customize game looks help run better quality audio good wish bit options tuning volumes able mute certain things overall big deal sound effects arent particularly amazing get big jarring youre constantly firing laser pistol hearing constant pewpewpewing ears usually turn effects bit enjoy incredible music game instead terrarias ost certainly one favorites id recommend giving listen even dont play game people tends scare away think theyre going get banned break game often thats even risk modding terarria allowed easy theres plugin called terraria mod loader allows simple browsing adding mods game would highly recommend looking youve played vanilla terraria couple times massive amount mods game still made improved right truly genredefining game
