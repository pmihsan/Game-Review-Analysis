friend saying get one someone please tell fix game similar minecraft different enough keep close game love online games hosted game well developed always great time playing terraria game similar classics like zelda metroid progression loot single world rather levels probably like metroid side scroller scrolls horizontally vertically map ends giant network rooms passageways access restricted certain equipment found find upgrade character unique equipment pieces often give character completely new abilities battle many enemy types evolve strategies find new gearbut one major difference old games one modifiable terrain entire map terraformable hence name terraria guessing changes everything game ends exploring deep underground cave systems digging way caverns spelunking placing torches climbybobs go alongthere hundreds weapons tools found throughout world melee range boomerangs pistols swords flying discs laser guns light sabers crossbows shotguns rocket launchers magic wands sorts mining equipment even augers one coolest grapling hooks game ever period hundreds armors nestled within dozens tiers equipment progress crafting system uses entire progression workbenches manage sheer magnitude possible items craftedyou explore deserts forests oceans demonic depths hell giant bosses npcs time based events dungeons chests loot coins actual good loot potentially single wooden boomerang map pull chest items placed randomly map world generated almost items zelda dungeons dispersed randomly world still retained importance due game changing abilities give character ya game eventually fly clouds like super badass laser swordand also terrain changes make persistent build house dig hovel whatever suits style stick around multiplayer people build houses servers similar minecraft go adventuring looting fighting together joining others worlds show houses farms even mechanism based contraptionsthe one complaint might actually make toooo many damn things game point seemed perfect balance kept adding maybe appease people cannot stop playing addictive people needed different swords choose playing game hours probably pretty weak argument sucks like swords make progression seem bit bloated especially compared finely tuned younger slimmer self achieved considered perfect progression felt complete made game feel complete game sorta feels endless maybe people actually prefer game simple theres much easily sink hours new things coming think replay game year later like discovering games potential first time great play friends game accessible players

hes apperently stupid weak things feel like chore crimsoncorruptionhallowed example feels like chore get rid comes contact home area crafting covered ingame however things confusing usually need look order find needing upgraded anvil craft certain things example cons really arent much handle slightly annoyingideas item blocks crimsoncorruptionhallowed spreading certain areas increase damage different weapon clothier please love god make red hats less commen drops explaination guide alternate things description items example bewitching table allows extra minion minutes make enemies little less annoying herpling please stop giving herpies make randomized moments slightly rare moments theres enemies constantly touching make bosses less likely despawn dont mean end night despawn thing

easy absurd easy understand jus anything game extremly good even better mods game kind classic fun spawned games like starbound make use styleso thanks terraria game life oh god yes game objectively amazing caveat takes effort see youre reading reviews attempting figure whether purchase game know two facts game deep diverse freeing moddable however upon starting would recommend watching firsttime terraria player video youtube dive expansive wiki learn walk around get confused said linear progression game offers always brings back bosses beat require finding better gear preparing useful boss arenas assist ranger using fantasyesque bows epicly fast guns even homing rocket launcher perhaps youd rather melee using broad range unique weapons maybe youd rather magician summoner fight bosses beat wall flesh radically changing gameplay compared past hoursthere many mods easy set following quick google search adds entirely new classes tons new weapons quality life features new bosses etc game runs steam let game objectively fun seemingly unlimited choices allow even unlimited playstyles one tip dont get attached game prone file corruption always make backups game objectively best
