useful interesting collectibles enormous metroidvania takes little bit time really grab wont want let go said wisps take minutes hour become truly engaging ori starts zero abilities besides nimble run

fortunately max health increase relatively quickly game shy granting abilities equippable powerups lessen difficulty curve wisps really opens however obtaining first couple mobility improvements

best game ive ever played storywise artwise gameplaywise jesus christ guys thingfire designers original ori really great ideas especially spear thing lets grapple onto shots enemies went wrongits completely ripped hollow knight cant trust sly thief design direction even graphics seem suspect look think theyre brilliantly vapidly pretty way original like hollow knight pretty forests magical plantthings weve seen million times beforethen theres story original ori really good story wasnt narcissistically selfconscious team cherry wanted thing story gravity result time round want manipulate living christ placing cute creatures everywhere youre simple thats takes charm youim already thinking lack creative spine patently obvious nothing trusted whole thing one big contrivance hopes god

first game greatmy favourite parts blind forest escapes platforming sequences function bosses stay ahead environmental hazard kill fall behind theyre intense challenging extremely satisfying finally manage get past wisps escape sequences boss fights felt easy point boring ive failed later succeeded blind forests escape sequences dozens times point yet still feel like challenge every time go anything wisps first attempt many parts blind forest proud beaten beating part wisps felt like thing going happen whether put effort notblind forest also simple beautiful story centred antagonist giant owl named kuro story wisps certainly good bits overall arc felt like little cheap rehash blind forests part antagonist second completely unrelated giant owl named shriek shes built fearsome storybook monster halfway game shes revealed backstory weak nearly abandoned game right kept going hoping shrieks weak character wouldnt tied closely ending unfortunately even without involvement ending felt like farlessmeaningful duplicate blind foreststhis second game added larger open world npcs sidequests customizable loadout simply extra features want sure might well buy youre looking challenge care storytelling want something truly exceptional go blind forest forget ever sequel ori blind forest favourite game time excitedhyped wisps since first teaser trailer however even

need ori wisps takes great blind forest simply adds first played ori went expecting typical platformer expect story good isamazing story beautiful graphics solid gameplay mechanics incredible game overall real complaint relatively short said worth still ori blind forest great game developers successfully analysed negative sides first game improved game includes combat boss fights first game

idea cool could executed better first time ever almost started raging playing either previous game dont count time tried complete game one life difficulty thats completely different story im glad able get past area relatively quickly honestly cant imagine bad section must people less practise spoileri believe ori able survive darkness little bit longer given flash ability sooner wouldnt bad make least bit less dark made really frustrated could barely tell supposed go tried go darkness seconds find path take died area already hard traverse darkness made painful came mora boss fight fine darkness final phase boss wasnt platforming section visibility wasnt big problem way boss awesome spoileroverall game smaller issues otherwise work art like first game like good platformers fun fights occasional smaller puzzles definitely give game ori blind forest amazing game problems heavily outweight amazing gameplay stunning visuals great soundtrack ori wisp fixed lay greater focus combat customization freedom player features real boss battles many new mechanicsand importantly fixed worst decision ori blind forest climbing ability given tree anymore seriously im still stunned useless ability made final game abilities fun way ori wisp worth buy looks sounds even better ori blind forest check write review game youve nominated steam awards box ori blind forest one favorite games time im glad say ori wisps improves upon former almost every way visuals music remains beautiful ever combat greatly improved wide variety melee ranged attacks deal enemies instead clicking enemy fast movement fluid ever even abilities feeding end game many movement abilities could probably make one end map without touching ground boss fights interesting addition go alongside escape sequences

way story makes want play superb platforming feels satisfying adorable characters emotional roller coaster every againadmittedly minor performance issueshowever good sequel first ori ori wisps ori brevity sake one rare sequels manages better original almost every way see review ori blind forest thoughts original basic formula first ori game hasnt altered much still platformer metroidvanialike world said almost every aspect original game refined waymovement much options added top ori gives almost every ability got ori right beginning builds results wonderfully advanced platforming segments later upgrades bit soandso others awesome additions oris repertoire combat received biggest upgrade ori didnt really combat system much single button could spam attacks interesting aspect system tied movement options able bash enemies getting double jump back still air ori takes pretty much movement abilities adds actual combat system top including multiple melee ranged options targeted attacks much feels way better ori integrates wonderfully movement flow gamein addition theres passive abilities called shards found world cool reward tend pick favourites stick also huge quality life improvements jump stick walls enemy drops magnet biggest offenders feel like people always equipped imo way convert true passives somehowthe real gripe game story sort central hub help rebuild using collectibles found world also find several npcs shopkeepers talk like addition makes world niwen feel alive compared rather static nibel robs game predecessors magicfairytalelike feeling made much worse ending game wont discuss reddit post spoiler warning url summarizes feelings almost perfectly exception point said minor complaint doesnt take away much game overalloverall ori wisps brilliant game cant recommend enough ori wisps game tried hard like hollow knightspoilers aheadwhen halfway game already knew disappointed didnt really like completed normal mode still cannot recommend itthis means bad game despite bugs ori getting stuck rubberbanding spoilerand think glitched last phase last boss complete without really something ideaspoilerwhat dont like trying hard fit much stuff possibly many abilities skills sockets melee combat long bossfights multiple phases escapes chases feel like lot copied hollow knight game love dont get wrong combat incredibly similar socket system shards exact samethe bossfights phases also nothing new youve played metroidvania games know cant reinvent wheel first game perfect thing felt like first ori game general movement ori platforming escape partshell even part story similar hollow knight spoilerthe decay either kills makes attack others like miners desertspoilerspeaking escape spoilersandwormspoiler worst thing ive ever done dont know developer thought good idea add unforgiving escape lasts almost one half minutes uses clunky bad mechanic glitches lot top checkpoints completing didnt even feel good hands shaking mad game needed break despite fact managed within trieswhat like though storytelling story okayish didnt like ending new characters sidequests also graphics absolutely stunning honestly didnt expect anything else matterif love ori blind forest way play first game skip one owl hatched adorable heck thats matters ori wisps review combatthe combat big improvement last game expansive interesting could access lots different abilities one time felt relatively distinct could choose specific play style enemies unfortunately less interesting mostly reskins enemies area fought one group monsters basically fought movementmoving felt ways restricted many ways much free previous game types movement gliding given relatively early nice indications like bash dash stuff much better signposted game often actually knew could situation various race type games could play unfortunately problem demanded extremely precise jumps many cases extremely frustrating slightest mistake meant would start difficulty races disproportionately harder rest game map travelim sure game map felt much less linear previous game actually enjoyed lot previous game felt like went someplace got ability backtrack way back kinds things game much freedom movement could go places map relatively early could teleport one campsites wherever moving around map felt much nicer designin every way music visuals game noticeably better previous game music worked extremely nice listen set appropriate mood similarly visuals much interesting dark places felt much creepy pretty areas extremely beautiful despite relatively similar type game area barring final area felt different previous game felt fresh character storyin game much heavier story characters wonderful fact could quests sheer number people could talk meant world felt much fleshed similarly progressed campaign interactions actually changed completed objectives feel much dynamic less static amount new lore learnt backstory even surprise end really good engaging quests particular particularly interesting mainly fetch quests still nice addition problemsunfortunately game rather major problem one far far worse anything previous game game extremely laggy pretty sure laggiest game played recent memory possibly ever sound frequently bugged made buzzing noise frame rates many points single digits every time teleported campsite took minutes game able play smoothly final cutscene every boss battle fact completely ruined stuttery lag spoilt game sheer frustration caused without lag id rate game lag give mosta minor problem mentioned previously also fact final area felt similar final area previous game conclusioni really want rate game highly visuals story music everything felt like improvement previous game original problems first game felt like dealt unfortunately lag completely ruined experience didnt enjoy game nearly much really would dont lag would highly recommend game lag good luck ill say ori wisps soundtrackmora decided reincarnate

starts plucking heartstrings sets unique gameplay rich world deserves mantle best b platformer metroidvania b market right story fulfilling music grandiose animationcontrol mechanic smooth jazz every levelregion map memorable specific palette gameplay challenges world building better though along lines hollow knight game excels offering fluidity moment moment enjoyment pushing narrative rather bog repetition speaking hollow knight moon studios seem pretty inspired neighbour team cherry charm system map progression certain elements successfully integrated game provides far better experience expanded gameplay options hand unique feature ori implements well responsive weapon wheel diverse selection weapons time around switching around fluid control animation scheme midst battle blast
