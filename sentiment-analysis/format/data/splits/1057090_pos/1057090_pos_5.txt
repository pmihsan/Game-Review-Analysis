aligning light reviving naru naru trying reunite child oriku doesnt anything ori get separated beginning reunite ku doesnt anything rest story thats shame looking forward potentially learning owls kuro maybe even shriek ku owls would make sense ah yes shriek like first game main antagonist tragic back story explains however shriek doesnt feel developed kuro backstory tragic one dont get wrong feel like theres potentially stuff missing story would help feel invested character invested kuro mother desperately try protect last child suffering fate first children im saying shriek needed mother invested im saying story could done little work apart good storyi never considered replaying first game played interested story didnt enjoy majority game game however wisps fantastically fun

description yetso remain calm resist urge play developers fix bugs quality life changes make gameplay lot fun memorableupdate seems like game got bug fixes qol changes two patches might time get play beast great beaten game highly recommend great experience think platformer expertly designed section feels lived well made really enjoyed gameplay amount freedom want go dothe story isnt anything revolutionary really expecting cute emotional really great characters honestly teared end game satasfying conclusionthe soundtrack game one favorite aspects much fun going section hearing different atmospheric sequences lot tear heartstrings also love color scheme uses art style beautiful great job ori stand everything game rewarding exploring hidden partsso far story scenery soundtrack go game done deal gripes genuinely hope ever make another type game least builds aspectsso energy currency pretty much worthless would go upgrade abilities ended left end game didnt really rely feel something useful got set got comfortable really much incentive try something new something needed think could implement complex upgrade system think pretty good job abilities could use throughout game really nice end could really reap reward using different types specific scenario something really irritated boss fight save much progress make pretty much nonexistent especially brutal escape worm spam ctrl like hundred times kept making end dying start way beginning extremely frustrating hope implement type save point bosses get aspect fight realize take pride accomplishing end boss fight hard work put save points make fight seem cheap honestly got super annoyed monotonous fight scenario dozens timesoverall one favorite games played long time glad experience would recommend bored enjoy platformers enjoy good story compelling charcters enjoy game awesome soundtrack breathtaking world put hours game think completely worth price pay buy hope get enjoyment able impressive like ori blind forest wisps beautiful art work music great story line others said one masterpieces game play builds blind forest ori new abilities character controls add experience levels boss fights challenging satisfying complete like ori blind forest worthwhile purchase im far halfway game really enjoying itpros beautiful graphics engaging game play good music better difficultycons particularly happy change action key action previous game different key action doable lb quite lot difficulty retraining muscle memory press one related game play unable log xbox account within game glitch keyboard doesnt work inputting usernamei nothing say kudos developers team another beautiful game like ori beautiful awesome game much hollow knight cannot go wronghard mode made sweat expected enjoyable experiencebring switch port ill buy doubt like first game sound design art story music settings spectacular feel like level design also seen quite improvement predecessor overall however disappointed game also carries highlights flaws previous game faced become especially clear boss fight startsthese issues think boil unfair hits player takes various circumstancesi feel like granular hp system part fault hp doesnt feel significant lose clipping edge spike hitbox respawning two minutes progress lost think even granular system would much forgiving bosses didnt also deal quarter hp random contact damage didnt hitboxes active attack phase transitions since bosses massive complex hitbox shapes often found incredibly difficult gauge location happened bit close boss would decide take unprompted step forward without giving time react eternally grateful generous checkpoint system boss fights allowed beat hour eachthe boss doesnt feature checkpoints deals lot contact damage quick attacks short telegraphs boss luma pools near end ended beating first phase flawlessly almost every time end dying attacks barely able read second phase boss cornered would often take two three hits normal mode imagine devastating blow hard mode outright kills runalso returning first game chase sequences think sequences best part first game mostly holds true well chases luma pools unfortunatelynotafulldungeon area desert feature couple instances fast scrolling becomes difficult parse whats ahead often repeat majority chase get another shot area im sure best way fix desert chase instances often came camera scrolling things onscreen comparatively late moving vertically instance luma pools also one player asked move vertically upwardsi hope whatever next game make feature generous hitboxes make segments game feel fair players easily able rely skill ought also satisfying player tackle difficult challenges generous hitbox doesnt even make game easier overallone last thing personal wish series feel like theres bit disconnect oris world layout levels area feels like designed linear dungeon often think makes traversing area dull formula extremely predictable zeldadungeonesque wish game would commit hollow knight side metroidvania individual areas may tightly designed instead feature multiple paths new areas introduced dont always feature plotcritical item may otherwise relevant traverse order get another area may something interesting feel like would help games feel like adventure checklist preserves sense wonder looking macguffin x player finds something maybe even interesting wellspring glades couldve exciting area come across pure accident exploring instance initially thought thats proceeded warp somewhere else start game thinking path onwards wasnt wellspring glades alasall definitly highclass nitpicking single individual hope take things account would really love able fully enjoy games even theyre giving escape sequences like first game ori delivers stunning music lovely graphics story line leaves tears eyes levels challenges well balanced thought new world explore music sweeps away well worth wait hope rumours true games works world like predecessor ori wisps nothing short work art would recommend someone definitely play first game trying however people fans first game might surprised find wisps simple platformer blind forest wasimproved combatchallenging satisfying fair platformingbeautiful visuallybeautiful make u cri like predecessor ori wisps absolutely gorgeous game delight playthe combat completely overhauled actually boss fights alongside classic escape sections prevous gameit simply great game play explore check one like predecessor great game like predecessor truly outstanding game visuals music gameplay top notch typical metroidvania fashion player navigates fights way world discovering upgrades important controls smooth responsive sequel highly acclaimed game people compare two exception wisps wotw took concept blind forest bf added new stuff notably focus combat player choices customization instead set skill tree player chose abilities passive bonuses plethora options either found bought throughout gamepeople call wisps unquestionable improvement blind forest tend disagree different refreshing flaws brought precisely changes course doesnt mean bad game list many active abilities bf made full use gamepad make abilities usable times wotw way many options make possible instead often ended browsing skill menu usually combat breaks gameflow stands contrast otherwise fluid gameplay choices felt meaningless slots passive abilities highly limited first half game one weary pick depending playstyle abilities clearly better others choice first place course aware players value different abilities purpose still feels uninteresting discovering new stuff often felt disappointing due limits mentioned previous point hurray yet another ability im never going use flat difficulty curve feeling progression halfway game player order want proceed area accessable unlike linear game also means however gradual difficulty possible area gets gradually challenging get one new ability required progress way bit zeldaesque items found incorporated specific area never used afterwards works fine first maybe second area player visits feels boring afterwards doesnt help point game player access movement tools meaning platforming challenges peaked point storywise progression didnt feel impactful clearing sections bf huge impact rest map felt something accomplished wotw yet another boss slain listin opinion compared bf story less enthralling immersive villain less relatable music albeit beautiful less memorablestill overall game masterpiece things mentioned pale compared things good great even liked previous game also like one like part oneone best games ever played pure love like ori games visual treat music also amazing expected various addition npcs welcome upgrade type game environments doesnt deviate much saw game breathtaking look calming needed also turn quickly nerve racking affair wants ive died times due environment enemies like game feel platforming section wasnt well thought needed memorization layoutmap rather reactive decision games best played controller games addition quests sidequest another welcoming affair turned metroidvania type platformer game sidescrolling action adventure game npcs also fun interact although sidequest ones end automatically without even accepting quest hand need players attention though game also added optional challenge sections time around combat trials multiple waves normal hard enemies spawns like survivalhorde mode platforming race challenge various spots map game also improved combat system significantly adding melee attacking options aerial combat main deal time around also juggle enemies combos unlock enough abilities quickly swap back forth auto attacking wisp game isnt available beginning youll however unlock sort similar auto attacking ability later game doesnt function game especially considering new aggressive enemies game improved rpg aspects game adding ability upgrades slots equip abilities time quickly swapped even combat also equip ability modifiers would either improve chances survival make harder turn game even challenging enemies significantly improved time around harder expected comes multiples enemy projectiles track player lot game arnt many boss fights game indeed atleast goodworthy bossfight isnt usual ori style runawayandsurvive sort stuff lot waterrun section game straight frustrating spoilerespecially final onespoiler breeze go fingers quick react stuff story bit led towards half especially ending might differ player player personally seen sort ending times media games wish game approach different ending b overall b game amazing play especially fan ori game isnt great recommendations havnt tried
