main difference new ori game last one combat big part experience overall think combat fluid works well though also feel like oris movement generally suited platforming oris options combat arent well defined also feel like combat part game doesnt emanate charm much everything else bit generic also enemy variety limited lots recolours hence combat suffers bitmy prominent gripes ori performance firstly crappy pc like going struggle keep lots crashes frame drops audio problems expected unless beefy computer personally using task manager quit game became procedural second lot bugs annoyingly controls default keyboard controls dont work changing causes random issues meaning actually creating setup struggle eg grab button isnt glide button grabbing wont work something figure trial errorone

wanting positive game also suffer attempt provide fairly objective view review contain spoilersprosart music sound design game superb level quality best seen video games makes game completely stand provide immersive experience beyond anything provided games price point goty quality respecta decent metroidvania pull heartstrings start game mostly end generally good things say gameplay combat completely boring extremely easy yet tight platforming mechanics surely appeal casual gamer likely playing game normal difficulty sequel immensely successful oribf people seeking story around ori happy see however think fact sequel contextualise reviewsconsi thinking game since completed much hate need inform people reading reviews shortcomings gamethe glaring issue game unfinished state technical level completely riddled bugs best destroy immersion worst make sections game unplayable cant believe game made beta testing stage honestly feels like never leftit comes across extremely halfbaked example bug mora forced replay entire boss fight point rushed couldnt bothered trying dodge damage ended getting nodamage achievement even though take damage game also completely unplayable dualshock controls mapped incorrectlyprofessional reviewers got copy game early typically excused ignored bugs review due assumption bugs review copies would fixed release casethe next issue game stems contextually fact sequel review oribf took issue fact game left useful ability dash players hands end gamewhile game variety useful abilities bash dash early good thing game still feels like section typically focuses use ability unlocked section really hinders games ability challenge players provide great platforming experience whilst abilities sections used others typically extensive use within platforming time latergame abilities burrowing used outside windswept wastes get shards otherwise locked game improves first providing useful movement abilities towards start however platforming never engaging would guess design choice developers might made cater casual audience platforming engaged final section requires ori maintain airborne really long time pushes player said high point platforming mildly challenging lasting minutes really highlights lackluster rest game regard platforming tight generally means nothing levels allow sloppiest execution platforming abilityon combat generally better first game however dodging whilst using standard slash pressing one button thats summed even case bosses sure additional combat abilities cost energy none efficient even useful circumstances tried using different abilities ended sticking standard slash something use combat healing ability entire game flying enemies pretty annoying enemy projectile deal bashing projectile straight back themon bosses game underwhelming mora shriek fights ones stand mora interesting phases require respond differently shriek step shrieks fight insanely good actually challenging died multiple times variety well choreographed attacks makes utilise movement abilities whilst forcing player try land hits attacks also interesting bullet hell segment though like platforming one boss coming right end obviously thought actually good despite short makes bosses including mora feel underwhelming even mora best boss game imoon sand worm really good escape sequence pushed player well utilise burrowing ability optimal manner ensuring player uses right angle diethe kwollok fight seconds without putting thought fight howl corruption whatever boss causes escape seen water mill incredibly one dimensional unchallenging useless bosses serve little purpose within wider story story good however good sea mediocrityby far one enjoyable aspects game side quests involving helping moki made every section complete feel alive progress platforming finding gorlek ore used bring community moki together central hub really engaging despite simple something found really heartwarming enjoyable story around shriek ku ok became emotionally attached fast would captivated progress story however bosses howlsand worm dont fit anywhere within wider story merely provide unmeaningful speedbump oris quest regard corruption understand fits story revolving around improving life moki letting water run clear corruption within minute player seen kwollok corrupt kwollok makes little sense story provide boring combat boss beaten seconds also provides one least meaningful fights within story devs decided raise emotional stakes suddenly without explanation corrupting kwolloki personally disliked bittersweet ending involving ori think shame throw away character become invested personal gripe objectively ending good makes sense foreshadowed also respect objectively think leaving story available continue another protagonist ending way oribf started good also dislike shriek ended rejecting warmth sought light yet final cutscene shriek believe intended make viewer pity feel sorry shriek involved seeking warmth implied dead parents makes little sense thought like lot storyoverall worth liked first gamemetroidvanias ori wisps opinion great game enjoyed challenge

pretty decent platformer however good original ori blind forest gameplay seems take inspirations form hollow knight identical charm system similar map system buy maps map maker overabundance abilities use lot seem overlap much abilities seem inferior othersfor example new leash ability bash ability similar function even share keybutton like developers decided add new leash ability replace bash old game later couldnt make minds one keep also problems ui abilities equipped three ability slots correspond three face buttons controller problem way quickly swap sets abilities use ability wheel individually swap abilities slot also resource based save system changed generic autosave system soundtrack mixed bag pieces big fights feel bit derivative music original game regular exploration level music new sounds nice overall whole game seems lack strong direction cant tell trying accomplishother straightforward sequel well received original game pretty fun pretty fun enjoyable pretty good game pretty good gameonly achivements pretty good gameperiodfewer difficulty spikes predecessor tho pretty good low medium difficulty matroidvania platformer amazing art really epic moments gameplay story feel bit formulaic youre fan original ori needed thats exactly needsome issues occasional freezes second two map takes frustrating couple moments load problems otherwise tried running linux game seems perform well windows pretty good metroidvania lot like hollow knight punishing beautiful scenery pretty good sequel first game pretty good ending isnt saccharine first game combat actually fun also difficult play mouse keyboardthe addition friendly npcs makes world feel alive full monsters trying kill youoverall definite improvement original pretty much flat improvement blind forest took hollow knight inspiration much open combat fun movement smooth sound bugs worth noting game needs bug fix patch overall dont think detract experience waythere complaints frame drops uncommonly powerful setup didnt get pretty much improvement every aspect previous game much longer well inspiration hollow knight clearly apparent twist gameplay sort combination hack slash game hollow knightthe art great enjoyable look pretty much par first game little better little worse certain aspects beat story completion hours think worth considering quality game tad buggy particularly underwater excuse tell influence hollow knight considering new ability systems npcs like new emphasis combat found balance issues abilities upgrades get make powerful never seem worth using like

completely water absolutely must get second part one greatest platformers ever disappoint new monsters new abilities new weapons much seems like oris inspired hollow knight seems like nice little game brief time played showed beautiful world music score however clearly made played game controller mousekeyboard could way clunky play controls seems quite like previous opus though bit dense quests challenges sequel ori basically hollow knight gameplay oris worldif like hollow knight well gotta love game sequel ori blind forest game continued use graphics style uses mostly gameplay new abilities ori use new customization system devs added challenges either directly provide upgrades give ingame money making upgrades im sure great idea safely ignore platforming challenges though bosses big angry figure lazy went guide third part somewhat dislike chase scenes little room errors isnt path pain hollow knight still painful speech ingame voiced gibberish actual meaning provided subtitles dont bother localized voicing sequel lives hype game play smooth controls well personally love upgraded combat system makes true metroidvania understand first game series didnt quite qualify challenging frustrating also story make sob sequels better original quite rare better originalbut said luma pools stupid frustrating sand chase know im talking played serious master piece first game hooked constantly thinking stunning looked smooth movements could possibly improve nailed every bit id recommend game anyone grab thank later seriously awesome game cannot imagine amount work truly went constructing amazing platformer everything sweet music indicating emotions feel ambience various ingame areas truly pulls game together near masterpiece edge getting game would highly recommend taking plunge dont regret dont let cute aesthetic fool game challenge challenge isnt bad thing since made investing play seriously love game havent play ori series man ure wasting ur entire gaming life best aspect game one much better one ofc one go buy play trust worth seriously best series games ever played think xbox pc versions ori blind forest must played game times one completed within two days purchase simply could put game platformer style coupled beautiful art amazing musical scores combat puzzles done right ive never much fun playing game series entire years life hope badly moon

art even better first one perfect one beautiful games ever played movement combat feels smooth fluid collectibles really fun look map big story really emotional intriguing hoped could get little bit lore world amazing bad find little bit short want keep playing games short simple improved version great view nailed first game chapter extra goodnessthere definitely advances areas combat variety platforming level design great length difficulty good onissues ask really things noe able reach many collectables well intended unlock point game via triple jump tight platforming gamebreaking leastto nitpick combat abilities pretty nicheunused find stuck worked swapping couple moves finding hard find scenarios abilities worth effortother couple glitches start appearing extended play time example grappling time would slow sometimes ori would accelerate screen insane speedsor warping screen would fade second time quite late already begun platforming sometimes returning new starting position extended sessions reopening game resolved issuestldr enjoyed first one youll enjoy one amount short sweet enjoy first game must play ori wisps emotional journey didnt expect make shed tear short answer yes totally freaking recommend game totally worth money even morethis game totally flied radar idea making even planned ive ori blind forest wishlist years last year dear friend gifted started playing instantly something happened never happened cried beginning cutscene remember crying game ever prior thatobviously steam recommended game releasing soon since played previous game get game loving owls huge course buy recently beat ori blind forest jumped straight one released wednesday since first launched game story happenings game dwelling mind nonstop story writers definitely knew make touching story stays mind even stop playingthe beginning starts happy got crying eyes happiness thinking happier game blind forest dont let happy beginning fool happenings game really heartrending cannot count many times cried cause game big points story makerslovely visual style found gazing scenery multiple times throughout gamereally emotional game huge rollercoaster emotionsi would recommend game times could best money spent everthank reading rant review hopefully got consider buying game cause definitely recommend bottom broken heartthank also developers making lovely game love work short sweet short summary review bveryb good game one mechanically solid praiseworthy platforming games played awhile much theres little critique mechanically nothing worth docking review score story entirely shows made comparison first game also anything point say terrible cant say part would critique means tell ori wisps fantastic game regardless spite flaws spoilers discussion details dont need read summarize full opinion bi recommend bmost points short format since critiques part minor need go detail give nothing praise platforming mechanically years since played ori blind forest frustrations platforming present really mean none slightest critique would anything platforming forgiving way easily bypass intended design complete platforming section first game missing platforming areas could mean falling spikes wait take damage ticks die return checkpoint platforming demanding required designed approach take game easy land spikes hop taking slight damage often could first game making things right way unnecessary freedom good comes expense challenge method reaching goal doesnt challenge also makes game drift away metroidvania lockandkey design typical genre loosened much linear times solved puzzle harder way missing tool right way hard notice otherwise platforming good game didnt feel like wrong noticed got power later even thats praiseworthythe game includes fair amount equippable powers modifiers feel like less approach would worked better many combat powers went unused werent necessary many shard modifiers arent worth equipping different power like unequipping platforming power combat one bossfight flow breaking tedious improvement combat wish many players first game given lot excess stuff isnt needed fewer permanent upgrades would made refinedbosses also bit weird game putting side side escape sequences bosses escapes make use platforming abilities youve practiced point show mastered sufficiently tense exciting bosses dont follow dont design approach normal monsters dont teach fight games bosses like games especially example like sekiro shadows die twice ori combat isnt difficult enough need learn anything normal monsters learn doesnt teach anything bosses made bosses feel arbitrary combo bossescape sequences felt lot better bosses alonelastly elements game design felt like tickbox inclusions done well say felt someone went wishlist players first game wanted added sequel better combat skills customization quests forest creatures forest den could build improve even zones like watermill zone forest zone sand zone winter zone water zone theyre gorgeous course first game hollow spiky sky mountain giant forest tree wellspring pure water ice fire forge mountain along side typical forest cave environments well done feel tickboxed main critique comes something feel summary story makes sense execution premise didnt make across design ori ku venture trying teach ku fly get caught storm land island suffering similar fate first game ku injured ori must rejuvinate spirit tree save ku time must realize destiny become spirit tree save land creeping forces decay save friend okay suppose comes across flat actual game lot little details contribute jumping novice ku getting caught storm save entire land feels arbitrary theres context powers gain like first game kind story behind npcs telling player ori save doesnt feel like proper buildup feels like best secret everyone knows since realizing destiny doesnt happen culmination story less get info dumped end game wall murals seir saying similarly bosses lack context bosses monster possesses local sage frog beat vanishes get sprite sand zone sandworm appears arbitrarily run done smidge context aggression given also note ori doesnt show much expression many game scenes think facial expressiveness body language could gone long way make feel like place story made sense hes incredibly stoic offputting adds feeling cant connect story time around sense story kind happens around ori instead involving first game players could connect ori desperate loneliness separation family almost universal sympathy ianyonei could attach worked pretty well story game doesnt feel relatable lacks punch heard moon studios planned ending original game context makes total sense games ending would fit first game perfectly makes juxtaposition jarring things say notably musical score lacks punch frequently pulls motifs popular track first game unsurprisingly tracks catchy would nice callback first game less ubiquitous tracks standout entire soundtrack quite excellent either way gareth coker wonderful job ask two ori games id recommend would say first one story issues sense concise design mentioned subtle significant thats fine good though excellent games well worth full recommendation ran bugs issues game plays excellently steam controller short hours get games goodies unlockables touching beautiful good game even though dust somehow ends eyes play short worth every pennylong worth every moment play time beautiful graphic phenomenal soundtracksthe game challenging level makes interesting entire play nominated

visuals exploration soundtrack topnotch far goodvery beautiful game outstanding visuals musicconsfps drops somewhat dissappointing far game ok everything would expect improved original complaints combat feels little clunky slow fighting one enemy really difficult sometimes controls feel like ice platforming could feel satisfying like swing poles jump excelerate really quickly almost immediately stop two bosses fought felt like didnt telegraph attack well enough wolf got lucky backed display skill part biggest issue much less optimized game dont incredibly powerful pc rune aaa games fine mediumhigh settings ori barely pulling fps resolution overall good recommend looking forward future updates hopefully addressing issues ive raised hereedit coming back starting play say issues cited review still exist stop buying game far game lived expectationsit like blind forest bigger better far game better original best part really improved combat aspect game well keeping platforming wonderful game great story amazing visuals far lives first one expect love game far really great enjoyable game far masterpiece far say without doubt game one best games time good good control audio bugs restarting game fixes enough save points big issue good graphics fantastic gameplay stellar heres perfect example hollow knight made found hollow knight tedious ori wisps basically ori hk mechanics game tough especially certain spots like hk separates two removal tedious redorewalk areas die fairuseful fast travel system unlike hk finished game compared ori blind forest game graphically way better first harder move along get much health times feels overpowering bosses health needed bosses good addition last one charts good challenging ive read people complaining one particular escape sequence hard remember tree escape sequence first one way challenging rage inducing music amazing like first movement tougher beginning end leaping around levels sorts abilities like platforming metroidvanias highly suggest games bought sale playing would problem recommending full price think liked first one slightly wisps although final boss almost makes two games almost even racetheres thing perfect game game first come pretty close magical beautiful emotional havent played ori games please get previous one well one games always makes cry like baby many beautiful scenes variety every area hooked whole time challenging impossible play mechanics great much better one loved verities skills mention fantastic art chilling soundtracks good boss fights specially last one dont know another notmaybe much feel train indeed im sad happy finishing game much feelings end say masterpiece developers reached goal made sequel better first game every part improved new wever implemented wish developers would create games moon studio thanks greate two games much fun gameplays amazing maybe bit easy even bosses really tough much improvement first fantastic game right combat skillfull punchy ever abilities well paced true metroidvania exploratory enablement story touched one games ever made cry tears start end game blast two impactfull story beats lovable characters without doubt one favourite games time hope subsequent playthroughs enjoyable first pretty similar first ori game different feels like brand new game followup story got far already defienately one favorites soothing emotional far developers wanted return mikos family new house made happy every side quest environment changes little bit fantastic look around people say going quest see impacts everything world times cute heck sometimes bittersweet othertimes right kick chest emotions ninjas start cutting onions nearbyvisually game absolutely breathtaking bugs game released could blame right activating watermill ghost race nearby would show race way ori would stuck waiting countdown run nothing happens esc abandon raceapart love game love allthank amazing game games really fun ive throughly enjoyed played getting certain part story involves new power dig things characters melee attacks longer hit anything dont know made game unplayable closeing reoppening game didnt fix either basically game yearyou cosplay shaihuludyou gotta run shaihuludthe toad cool heartbreakingyou punch gorillasnew big enemy creepythe big spider kinda cute abd voice mmmteleport everywherebetter blind forest whens one gonna come switch like first one id buy watch worth waithands best visuals amazing storydefo gamei need played ori hours total game time completed everything game zones skills shards quest etc like first ori game absolutely love game mechanics skills story line side questsunlike first ori version lot different ways customize ori help progress adventures ability choose different active skills well passive bonuses make game feel like control play style however really far truth unfortunately tons shards available slots available use given time normally would swap based situation shards even worth using slots filled mandatory shards like magnet sticky catalyst overflow reckless spirit surge resilience lifeforce either key mechanic features raw damage buffs able kill enemies throughout game last slot one available diversity buildsfurthermore weapon skills either mandatory novelty weapon attacks like spirit smash required crushing walls floors enemies shields various types launch light burst regenerate also key skills using entire game however skills spirit edge exact thing spirit smash free cost use quickly replaced required mechanics latter skills like sentry spike spirit star blaze cost far much resources actually use limited resource pool almost done game personally never found use throughout full play thought ninja stars spears light seem cool mechanics clunky dont provide anything cant get light burst anyways sentry plain bad sentry basically doesnt damage requires cast whole gang one enemy leave energyfinally think going try spirit arc bow build dont bother use mandatory spirit shards even make function right give key shards try novelty buildover enjoyed game opinion rather short points required quick google search clue spots almost impossible figure without lots dumb luck talking musical flower puzzles hopefully time content developers make balance changes add additional content time start feel like mastery game decent build moon studios doesnt know write sequel ori game excellent anywayexcellent movement appropriate difficulty effective trick last game time highest adrenaline best music highest production value set pieces point player hasnt quite mastered new toy theyve given keep long time inserting difficulty spike grudgingly respect ori views mechanical prowess means end skill necessary mastery fulfilling create experience end goal still would appreciated optional sectioned areas simpler design could feasibly content polished escape sequences perhaps without bosstimer theres anything wrong goodold anxiety inducing inevitable death bringing beautiful animation flaunting bosstimer importantly would preferred story structure line player experience persistence improvement overcoming seems despair

combat much fleshed added whole new dimension game lot creative feels lot rewarding play definitely direction traditional metroidvania style games welcome carryover first game wandering aimlessly looking slightly undiscovered areas get tedious someone minimal time playstory pretty much direct continuation first game could play game without played first though youd lose lot attachment characters getgo makes story little less impactful game feels different mainly due addition many friendly npcs make forest seem lot less threatening lonely definitely upbeat even similarly emotional prologue first gamesoundtrack gareth coker back produced another incredibly fitting soundtrack brings game together favourite part first game likely second time around remember seeing bit negativity surrounding use repeated motifs first game motifs around never saw issue bring coherence soundtrack establish theme personal preference course overall proppa mint mate gerrit bought still small bugs
