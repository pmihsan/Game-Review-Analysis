best platform games right pick hard put love characters game fantastic loved ori blind forest really upgrade stunning art cool abilities great soundtrack game freaking great everything first game lacked fixed even improved sequelori wisps great game level design music mechanics comes together link game quite timei totally recommend game game fun isnt lot movement mechanics feel nice certain specific options handle terribly burrow swim dashing grapple etc game mightve bit fun framerate issues actually fixed stands cant recommend game importantly end game get power trivializes previous platforming sections rendering point platformer moot obnoxiously stupid sections downright easy others game good game good game good first one better let tell whyit unique style vibe mechanics one feels like im playing softcore hollow knight great mechanics opening map getting experience first game speak cartographer hello hollow knight adding spirit shards charms hollow knight generally making currency spirit light trading npcs first one pure experience could interpreted character power growthi still think game looks sounds amazing small things disappointed developers created original concept feel first game instead developing threw everything bin took hollow knight concept insteadand makes frustrated game gorgeous gameplay top notch music sends chills spine story pulls heartstrings like unbelievable could top previous installment leave wanting ori game great every single aspect youre even remotely interested platforming game everything music atmosphere mechanics combat everything going find bugs first playthrough second never experienced anything odd might patched although wasnt anything gamebreaking oh great decided play second time directly first playthrough tell something game great definitely much better prequel ori actually knows fight combat game enhanced much absolutely much better first game also much bigger first oatbf small oatwotw big gives many things many weapons many options challenges take oris move set similar oatbf slight changes oatwotw definitely worth dollars recommend one really enjoyed first wants play fun game game great masterpiece eyes replaying art style soundtrack well continues draw great story fun gameplay think great improvement first already great one favorite games far one best ive played game great love everything runs fine pc issues game great really good enough computer run enjoy metroidvanias cant recommend enough people might disagree feel game near perfect execution aside bugs ive heard compared okami despite different genre style agree statement first game series focuses story exploration wisps combatfocus skimping aforementioned id suggest playing prequel first since im opinion one better pretty good game finishing game first time might take hours depending play id say among games would come back play every years case mentioned bugs moment though game much enjoyable despite game great combat great metroidvanias like hollow knight little clunky repetitive however movement incredible moving around world enjoyable start chaining together right skills maybe even better movement mario odyssey world exploration also nice creative super detailed visuals audio wrapped together world beautifulalso theres lame glitches like able pull levers changed personalized controls without switching back default pull switch back custom every switch even need switches theres like game completely irrelevant overall dont break overall enjoyable game hands one best games ive ever played immersive storyline beautiful graphics incredible soundtrack challenging gameplay considering picking hits every single category play game hands best library emotional beautifully designed cant give enough game honestly masterpieceit pretty much takes first one makes better lot aspects never review games love one much review itthe visual design music youd expect ori mindblowingly good one biggest reasons game charming immersive times wanted stop take scenery listen beautiful soundtrackthe platforming level design also really good level brings something new gimmicks abilities required overcome obstacles said level speaking abilities fun feel smooth polished however highly recommend change keybindings since abilities overlap times youll accidently use ability didnt want could possibly lead deaththe story means anything complex perfect example simple yet effective cute adventure surface tells tale loss love sacrificeand last least combat favorite part unique really separates game last one ill start mentioning weapon wheel weapons equipped time first might seem restricting actually really nice piece design since swap weapons middle battle depending need enough weapons game suit multiple playstyles experiment different synergies one minus however shards lot feel somewhat unimpactful boring mostly giving damage damage resistance cells etc though polished smooth combat also previous pros didnt care shards muchthe one single major con game fps drops sound stutters break immersion time time really wish immerse id suggest waiting patchesall loved game hands one best games ive ever played highly recommend anyone loved first game loves metroidvanias general game incredible took great original bumped eleven great additions like new weapon upgrade system challenging puzzles boot go play game game incredible challenging yet fair gameplay story definite think new favorite game time game incredible absolutely beautiful like first gameplaywise feels similar ori blind
