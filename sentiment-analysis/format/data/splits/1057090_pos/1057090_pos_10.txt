improvement graphics visuals new barter system light shards lots unique boss fights interaction characters across map place interact charactersshops spirit shard choices ability make hard things easier farming things first option buy maps shards made easier get spirit light list diamond wispsb great platformer without flaws although clear improvements compared predecessor new installment unfortunately shortcomings detract otherwise great experience aspects movement combat navigation significantly improved generally makes smooth experience game also includes new friendly npcs interact although send pretty basic fetch quests addition game many new abilities upgrades unlock though expensive probably use youve already beaten game gameplay mechanics arent always clearly explained game able jump higher swing horizontal rods able touch certain obscure switches knowing quite frustrating especially since often clear whether due acquired certain ability yet youve missed tiny detail lead unnecessary backtracking adds frustrationoverall although clear improvements terms gameplay additions feel bit poorly executed took slightly less hours game hard modeb music game good though oftentimes less memorable tracks used predecessor arguably melodicallydriven style previous game replaced mostly ambiencedriven style makes music suit scene cost making music less memorable said sound effects music contribute immersive experience game gorgeous look game certainly lot colorful predecessor overall composition made number different layers creates nice sense depth world particle effects excellent animations smooth said think predecessor focused intimate artistic style whether thats good bad personal preference unfortunately game dropped ball opinion game introduces many new characters hardly undergo development story game sets high expectations certain characters first introduced simply fails deliver expectations end game leads number plot holes awkward moments story certain outcomes seem match set expectationsin addition core mission protagonist similar one endure first game fact lot key story aspects game similar ones used original game necessarily bad thing would nice taken creative approach developing story game definitely blast play quirks make game less memorable predecessor moon studios decide make definitive edition game would probably wait one come

fun gfx good although samey samey everywhere eg literally always vegetation blowing wind even deepest caves kinda weird animations detailed well paced music sometimes good lot time really trying force mood found hard get used sfx statisfying ambience sounds dont match animations dont help immersion think game couldve really benefited eg massive rainstorm sounded like occasional drops water generally everything sounds like washed distant like whole game supposed feel like big blur game good length bugs encountered story generic magical bs trees life shit spoileri wanted owl friend live couldnt care lore whateverspoiler mean really good game worth money feel didnt really hit like intended emotional extravaganza even without theres plenty fun stuff nice finally play game surely evolution first oneheres good badgood good curated graphic good tears moment story relate nice platforming modulebad game main story makes feel little short side quests adds nothing game start finish

long loading times open shape bit beautiful problems addressed gonna great game really nice game ton fun moving darting around controls like dream fact every enemy glows like make things confusing surrounded though must admit hate swinging blue lamps though basically orginal ori mechanics hollow knight liked games like beautiful game ever easier first game thats good first one hard taste even manage beat stressful lolthis one better experience fun even better first one im loving much superb work fun sandworm killed great especially liked first one hollow knight levels good beautiful like first one better fantastic beautiful cohesive controls smooth lovely use makes feel like really tiny nimble spirit creature dashing miraculous expansive world simply outstanding game experience complaint aside occasional mostly insignificant glitch easy sometimes youre attentive enough get majority hidden health upgrades go utilize resources well ie synergy spoilerthe energyforhealth regen ability overflow shardspoiler tank way lot interesting challenging obstacles unfortunately suppose thats hardmode thats ill next theres plenty reviews get specific pros cons improvements first game

terms platforming feel blind forest still somewhat challenging since game gives many movement upgrades plus final upgrade give op probably something save post game game didnt combat much robust compared blind forest since x spammy kind aim instead getting general direction hitting x bosses way fun fight blind forest since least chase sequence back fun ever biggest gripe probably story bad means explaining anymore go major spoiler territory ive seen think moon studios hopefully keep series alive end since one favourite indie gamethat ovewhelmingly positive pissing game worth every

relaunching game give ori wisps continuation first game time around game much open ended many side quests secrets find helps game much playtime ori didnt much main quest replay value low visuals greatly improved animations crisp game runs smooth settingsgameplay gameplay little different ori wide range skills quite helpful defeating bosses ori put multiple bosses time last time boss battles soundtrack quality sound track still pretty good main theme first game starts playing felt nostalgic much issues games due map massive time sometimes finding objective quite hard maybe thats worth ori wisps almost masterpiece almost could go game fluid gameplay ability set greatly increases oris maneuverability beautifully crafted areas animation yet slight lack polish encountered throughout time game really stops placing definitive label inability finish quests without mashing e key musical cues lost replayed cutscene audio visual stuttering forcing change gpu settings dont get wrong still amazing game obvious amount love care put game well worth price tag yet times encountered bugginess firmly pulled games ethereal experience particularly realized bugs experienced players since release five months ago game exceptional caliber otherwise disheartening seemed released ready bedespite complaints would wholeheartedly recommend game truly well deserved sequel ori blind forest effortlessly surpassing quality every area especially compared aspects game found almost flawless bugs easily fixed near future seen multitude patched initially wrote review july perhaps bugs experienced fixed leave thoughts however game best played blind cant help rest review might bit spoilery sorry rest review bit long ive divided several parts feel free skim read certain sections likeill start first story one reasons enjoyed blind forest much complaint lies contrived starting felt upon kus first flight ku ori choose follow flock birds way past limits nibel across sea foreign land seemed completely hand would ori careless travel far get trapped storm tumble dark forests niwen soon naru gumo looking see flock birds unearthly reason decide ku ori must followed seemed ridiculous part ku serves central role story seems especially contrived relationship ori solely developed cutscenes prologue couple minutes gameplay game revolving around made seem like plot device anything else much better exposition would ori ku learning fly perhaps one day see niwen dark foreboding distance perhaps come back regroup talk naru gumo decide investigate reach foreign land realize decay like nibel like good samaritans take upon restore ori ku looking silent forest encounter shriek tragic event takes place would much emotional weight particularly naru gumo witness save minor gripe ori wisps still brings home masterclass story hope loss mercy redemption bringing player understanding however pitiful main antagonists origins like blind forest delivered ending completely shattered tears moon studios really knows develop end storyill also quickly touch music graphics gareth cokers soundtrack blind forest never gets old brings life boss fight area enemy also serves heartbreaking touch games final moments graphics anyone see went beyond amount love care precise little details area background cutscenes honestly puts blind forest shamea refreshing change compared blind forest revitalization combat blind forest combat secondhand focus platforming evident major challenges game escape sequences simplistic attack sein heavy grunt work attacking made sense wisps two much shorter escape sequences six grueling boss fights new focus combat reflected new wide variety attack choices pros cons unlocked easily switch using attack point game focus also displayed story compared gumo kuro blind forest bosses encounter game often unwavering final breath idea putting six feet yet bosses would classify forgettable simply offered little challenge practically nothing story include first boss wolflike creature named howl encounter first couple minutes introduction niwen defend closerange torch darting quick succession blows reaches half health boss fights ends turns runs screeching forest first doesnt seem strange rather seems teasing second boss fight rematch better abilities weapons except well never happens find petrified corpse silent forest later game missed scene turned stone second boss hornbug glorified version rhino beetle whose main attack consists charging quickly simply outmaneuvered gain access unprotected rear last forgettable bosses willow stone fifth boss youll encounter ball energy covered stones knock away attack admit successive playthroughs completely forgot boss located penultimate area otherwise consists solely platforming challenges seems well place three bosses spoilermora corrupted kwolok shriekspoiler actually deserve title boss offers challenge really tested platforming skills maneuverability choice attacks especially hard mode learn bosss set attacks cues well pairing appropriate method attack would loved boss fights included challenging aspect game ever satisfying masterfinally weve reached heart game oris ability set somehow moon studios able surpass blind forest adding grappling ability burrowing sand swim dashing damaging projectile also bash launch ori propel themself direction adding whole new dimension
