fix problems whenever happened though would recommend game sale loved everything original disappointing sequel major problems previous game pros game pretty controlling ori fantastic interesting platforming level design allowed sequence breaking good improved moveset ori terms platforming cons combat sections suffer much visual noise often always feels like main challenge melee combat figuring enemy boss fights usually better always combat much less satisfying platforming general makes combat even frustrating cannot creative combat platforming designers probably looked combat ori thought good improve fine way improved giving ori moves making enemies interesting fight platforming level design fleshed original game level design still good never really felt like ramped degree original sections require use oris full moveset many unskippable cutscenes amount control wrestled away player game staggering though proper cutscenes skippable game recognize much time control taken away cutscene time wisp something say npc animation get dialogue ori happens upon story beat game halts stop one thing alone absolutely killed motivation go back replay game story nothing special think game beautiful soundtrack epic designers thought story really moving impactful simple played makes amount time terms cutscenes baffling game longer hours experienced less great platforming original took hours long set piece style platforming bits never original felt cues werent good enough reliably complete first try nothing changes one section expected hide behind tattered cloth hiding

guardians born tree spoiler comes making sequels theres generally two routes one take drastic overhaul reimagines game scratch safe iteration keeps works focuses improving things didnt ori wisps falls heavily latterthis means things defined first game exactly remember fluid satisfying movement gorgeous handpainted levels captivating music simple emotional plot added time things sorely lacking engaging tactile combat system big wellcrafted bossfights characters world talk interact expanded lengththe game really falters technical department unoptimized asset streaming causing occasional hitches framerate dips spaz sound also mentioned game simple fairytale plot dont go expecting dazzled writing comes reviews words waver falter place im speechless games amalgamation perfection wisps never triplea developer could ever hope wrestle likes moon studios oris incredible reputationdont doubt want buy either game play one two sittings completion thats thing fun really fun man filled brim bugs bad game design poor balancing cannot recommend despite huge fan first game sequel better original music really good telling story announced wisps hyped popped harder anyone knew excitement well placed everything ori blind forest heavily improved amazing storywriting greater gameplay mechanics smoother story flow placement quests side quests lastly overall fun bad thing wisps freezing worst moments especially chasing sequences im sure moon studios team trying rectify problem definitive edition sorts like ori game made cry like ori became best game ever played surpassed ori almost every

start end including side quests collectibles cannot recommend enough absolute gem platformer definitely revisiting future didnt enjoy one quite much original still incredible game quite worth money due current issues sound occasionally working sale would heavily recommend buying havent played much yet immediately see changes theyve made last game already loved ori blind forest already tell one superior likely inspiration hollow knight another game absolutely adore im thankful new featureswhats combat much enjoyable moved targeting light orbs light blade swing directions similar hollow knight far tell probably many skills havent discovered skills collected much like hollow knight amulets forgot names select equipped collection allows go play style instead following limited options skill tree like ori blind quests form npcs currency last game dont skill tree instead purchase itemsskills npcs giving lot freedom choiceit perfect singleplayer platformer relax also gives satisfaction beating monsters whatever style prefer allows fly map incredible speeds due convenient overpowered skills collect early game much like first game difficult opinion still fulfilling honest cant say much considering ive played like hour definitely worth money think combined best parts ori blind forest beautiful maps soundtracks skills hollow knight combat skill system quests im way ori wisps already shaping great game offers exploration puzzle solving tight controls previous installment adding several new mechanicsbuttons assigned certain capabilities much like links awakenings gameboy world feels populated npcs littering landscape giving hints side quests driving story alongin particular new rpg style equiping shards managing given scenario interestinglooking forward finishing one recommend game think almost masterpiecemoon studios really needs hire good talented writersalmost everything game top tierbut cant help feel game really needed lorebetter dialogues well written side questsi really bothered consistently bad writing mainly perfectly well designed everything else isthe final nail coffin dog shit endinganother minor problem would weapon design generic uninspiredthe combat improvement blind forest hoping something creative comes weapon design sadly let lot like first game made huge improvements combat alone good enough recommend game liked first one doesnt hold story wise predecessor still superb metroidvania surely replay year two enjoyed every hour money well spen may little bugs glitches like getting stuck wall screen going black happened restart fixed performance hiccups fps sometimes goes like slow motion effect mostly system aint used kinda old masterpiece game art style visual fidelity sound sound editing music gorgeous played game headphones spent least half hour listening menu music combat better ever fluid awesome game isnt forgiving comes difficulty side even normal game pretty challenging sometimes especially slow pc sometimes also platforming ask bit usual player like handholding something fond games start finishall pleasant experience despite negatives recommend anyone looking platformer tight controls touching narrative kinda feel love care went game notice details world quality still annoying moments like first game good way like cuphead game expanded first game every way told richer story better encounters levels abilities obvious comes combat mechanics game heavilly inspired one certain representative genre ori wisps still maintans focus one main attractions first game movement chase sequences endgame abilities blind forest available almost immediately betternew shards system different combat spells allow variation abilities much better choices making wrong choice could make one boss fights much harder becomapred predecessor game linear side quests nice little bonus expect much story behind plenty collectables serve purpose completing everything hard difficulty took hoursoverall improvement first game enjoyed thoroughly despite technical issues like rare audio stutters felt story lacked cohesion towards end little bit repetitive still art direction soundtrack flow game make must play metroidvania fan playing prepare box tissues side either blown away blown away absolute masterpiece game game good done even better definitely would like recommend game everyone game frame rate dips sound errors time time least got opening day experience still worth fun gameplay emotion story fantastic soundtrack good first game must play fan metroidvania games game beats first one things isnt perfect yes graphics improvedthe side quests new additions mechanics truly amazing stunning rpg feel game comes cost character development diffrent take ori universe gameplay additions less relationship building made first game heads right direction falls short towards end story still recommend beautiful game dont expect offer emotional depth first one game feels little derivative resemblance hollow knight lot right combat feels decent though large health pool floaty imprecise movement means particularly complex challenging ability options nice though didnt usually find using two three story much like first game incredible takes darker less hopeful tone ending game really happy ending ori many people youll meet along way long story short id recommend game anyone enjoyed first game anyone else likes metroidvania style games hurt game devs battletoads speeder bike level game great got runordie events whoever thinks dark souls hard never played thisbut liked visuals wholeheartedly enjoyed playing start finish pacing fantastic bit confusing time overall welcome experience wholesome game great gameplay beautiful graphics took already great

mainly acting expansions abilities combat overhaul bf huge improvement new systems implemented worked well biggest improvement bf though opinion reduction linearity sections game done order also countless fun productive side activities sidequests getting collectibles honestly fun part game bf never game wasnt interested enough wotw game almost twice actually within first week main problem comes form bosses escape sequences fantastic bosses thought mediocre bosses felt developed bosses felt unfair boss though absolutely incredible though really good record almost every area great average areas game far higher bf every area felt like lots places go things felt completely unique traverse explore best areas though able accomplish something areas bf werent able really capture atmosphere best areas wotw make feel lonely afraid send shivers spine time ive seen atmosphere created well areas hollow knight currently game pretty buggy one point projectile spamming able cause tree gives upgrades disappear already upgrade made another nearby object disappear proceeded somehow make entire play area go black exiting game caused main menus background go black fixed relaunching game far weirdest bug ive seen anyone encounter though seen screenshots invisible poles getting stuck air let clear bugs arent common happen dont think substantially impact peoples experiences though tldr movement ori expect combat revamp good bosses iffy areas make blind forest look like joke kinda buggy good game buy game wisps unique art style blind forest gareth cokers wonderful compositions gameplay quite frustrating times hardest difficulty may need step away come back fresh mind get certain parts worth struggle play hauntingly beautifullycrafted world although times quest system rpg elements seem place compared previous game simply unlocked abilities finding spirit treesall one games transcends platform becomes art wisps improves upon first game every aspect artstyle soundtrack platforming exploration combat significantly improved presence real boss fights helps round many levels game rivals quality hollow knight much shorter package wisps great game great sequel like changes combat story great blind forest great pattern sadness catharsis wisps different story way kicking youre brings bit hard truth realism otherwise whimsical world overall story art game whole great would definitely recommend playing wisps near perfect sequel original game environments dropdead gorgeous story fantastic music absolute top notch thing truly holding game back number technical glitches never fail rip immersion away b sweet lord make audio buzzing stop b imagine enough polish good enough computer quickly dealt wisps successful evolution ori blind forerst almost every aspect casts spell like predecessor fans first part lot wishes getting fulfilledit even beautiful first part score immaculate immersive againthe combat improved even boss fights time nothing crazy dont expect hollow knightlike fightsif want criticize something sequel doesnt dare much new many things bigger better real innovations really change experience rather short supplythe chase sequences back unfortunately problems first part paths always clear controls sometimes way increased number available skills necessarily make easier autosaves making longer sequences pure trial errorafter first major patch technical problems less solved longer spoils fun game release fewer bugs would nice however wisps one best metroidvanias ori animates much control player movement thanks various creative abilities upgrades simply jumping around world exploring massive map alone funcombat bit focus wisps first game even game never opportunity push limits fine considering exploration atmosphere selling points gamespeaking world niwen great job immersing player feels like decaying kingdom beautiful nature focused locations thrown balance otherwise grim theme outmeanwhile music alright notably beautiful tracks otherwise isnt much talk visuals almost always good reason keep going though areas looking good enough incentivize stopping admire detailed environmentsif enjoy metroidvanias lots
