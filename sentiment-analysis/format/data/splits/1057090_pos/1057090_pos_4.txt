disappointed wotw maybe thats fault wanted fun owllight creature adventure sometimes often tedious execution platformer clunky controls end result even though theres abilities larger maps bunch boss fights still like first one betterso lets start good game looks great design unique environments best ive seen anywhere home base mechanic actually pretty fun collect loot help creatures map get stuff improve home settlement wotw great job predecessor really opening map go defeat dangers unlock new abilities map easier cross ways music really solid sound design general pretty good oh since im gonna call sand darkness traversal later credit credit due one fun water levels ive played mechanics played well probably best looking zone game pretty fun buti gripes quite actually game issues gate didnt ssd wouldnt played game installing standard hd played like garbage okay games running fine sound messed well computer speakers sound messed fix headphones fix everything mostly still crashed areaswhat controls well sometimes auto lock targeted abilities bit odd respond indicate itll something going press latchchargedo thing button thats much problem general platforming nightmare time trial escape sections vertical movement relation jumping targeted abilities extremely confusing jumping early lessen height things substantial amount like abilities mapped different buttons contextual shared abilities exercise frustration especially game puts one mess start scenarios lot look ive played super meatboy hollow knight games tightly controlled hard balance perform right actions controls enable wotw controls mess clutch hard even perform action youre trying abilities never used game meanwhile super important one sold vendor since missing abilities supposed know important one could leave rot put important one map dont miss itmap elements like sand darkness sections didnt really appeal either kind put game rails rather promote exploration yeah opens map sections get mileage youre clearing lot less revisit cant say really enjoyed themthey gave new fight controls really floaty everything air hard tell im hitting best way approach half enemies would make difference except combat pretty easy get halfway game yeah could crank hard mode wanted play againoh plot okayagain issue first one ending gets writers want doesnt really tell compelling story right moments pacing way used characters seemed contrived unnecessary say would spoil still dont like ori writingin end ori twice much needs dark cute fun lighthearted meticulously demanding difficult platforming easy boss fights massive number abilities half useful platformers much want execute well wotw lot things didnt really perfect guess okay great cant decide two games better game pretty much like first one good thing one however completionist friendly first managed get everything first playthroughthe ori games trurly masterpiece game always top games time cant describe amazing game everything gold story soundtrack course beautiful graphics absolutely loved playing game masterpiece cant even count many times ive listened soundtrack ori games gone visuals nevermind last month since played first one game first absolutely needed get able first one amazing second one didnt disappoint even bigger first much simpler terms story though less amazing adding multiple npcs side quests really help build world set mood felt boss encounters even fun though challenging including actual boss fights instead chasesthere also multiple mechanics really enjoyed game first almost didnt realize inconvenient things first ori started playing one saw changed everything feeling large part due player feedbackstory absolutely amazing heartwrenching almost moreso first feel course im judging fact game actually get cry last scene shriek killed impactful feel like game maybe didnt bittersweet overall absolutely loved itspirit trials worst least favorite thing game ever silent woods took probably least tries cant express enough game played anybody everybody experience art style music story absolutely stunning alone enough recommend game suggestion must play first game really feel connected characters understand going bit better environments music absolutely stunning times may find sitting admiring look soundtrack gameplay also amazing like platformers one smoothest controls platformer ever played well great explore included bunch new abilities well ones previous game make traversing environment fluent combat rehauled original game gives somewhat hollow knight vibe definitely better abilities homing attack bomb wisp first game mechanic replaced number different melee ranged attacks really lets play style bit also included similar system charm system hollow knight modify abilities like light bow get shoots arrows instead example damage increases also carried multiple difficulties allow different skill levels playthis game must play cant get beautiful game looks cant give game enough praise music gameplay storytelling beautiful aspects love platforming love ori cant put words awesome game really combat fun meaningful upgrade blind forest platformingmovement fluid satisfying fun levels beautiful npcs interesting well designed believable music killer especially boss fights took wonderful aspects blind forest expanded upon story always favorite part ori one disappoint im gonna lie got choked lot playthrough b overall ori wisps striking beautiful literally cannot put game definitely worth checking fan metroidvaniaesque games b cant put words amazing game much everything done perfectly combat never gets old always exciting puzzles always challenge huge intricate map character progression abilities story amazing pissed even side quests long story short youd dumb enjoy game definitely play watchplay ori blind forest first first game series cant recommend enough loved cant recommend ori games enough imaginative challenging emotional dramatic absolutely beautiful masterpieces far im concerned cant recommend game solely ive played first one standalone propably good game beginning noticed blatantly game rips plot first game establishing characters way felt emotional connection character game really really loved even villain first gameproslots cool puzzles movement options ori combat revamp combat never oris strong suit revamped feels lot refined still lacking behind metroidvanias like hollow knightactual bossfightsamazingly beautiful music visualsconsbad character developmentreused plot devices overall worse story first gamea lot gimmicky features like map trader basically useless get equivalent map exploring everything anyways timed parcour routes fun nothing meability powercreep spoileryou frequently get abilities make ones completely obsolete like tripple jump startdashspoilerkeep mind bad game still enjoyed playing recommend half time playing felt like reused content first game thinking playing visuals gameplay music definitely recommend game cant recommend game enough great game play story cant recommend game highly enough art story game mechanics amazing lot love went making game cant say enough positive things masterpiece game adventure whole way puts emotional roller coaster never seems end multiple moments game made cry something least makes game amazing im happy bought game dont regret slightest cannot express music heavenlyone best adventure metroidvania game cannot recommend game unfortunately love first ori would probably liked one could finish release issues lag sound patch fixed issues cannot finish game surprise surprise new game breaking bug wont waste another hours get part get bug really want game wait definitive addition cannot recommend game enough great metroidvania great story superb musicthe biggest con introduction many concepts hollow knight love hollow knight thats much problem really p cannot recommend game enough story gameplay art style pacing cannot recommend masterpeice enoughenough said cannot stress amazing game almost every way improvement first game including music little bumpy launch bugs irond since despite imperfections game serves great example incredible art direction emotional story writing jaw dropping music composition fun engaging gameplay wisps borrows number elements hollow knight also keeping fresh new metroid castlevania created metroidvania wisps fine tunes gives polish game incredible far favorite mine cannot understate amazing game game many things right ridiculous platforming probably best ive ever played bash mechanic especially wonderful thing come back first game ability bounce projectiles enemies klonoaesque works perfectly fluid gameplay ori combat surprisingly way better expected minor complaint bosses way tanky make hard get clobbered still major complaint since theyre still loads fun even new element game presents beyond last one oh word soundtrack amazing gareth coker best soundtrack least par superior blind forest story telling rams like arrow complex got really good like child watching disney film honestly id say ori even surpasses disney comparison could gush game would rather keep surprise anyone hasnt played masterpiece yet easily best game opinion cant believe amazing game played first one fantastic deep storyline many great twists bought hoping would match gameplay combat got better story tears beautiful sad time amazed good game havnt played havnt played first one get start cant give game enough ups insanely beautiful dont like game probably shouldnt play platformers metroidvania games ever cant stress enough good game ending still think even though finished game months ago game says life animals games movies people superior first far likely best game ever played completed game would say overall quite enjoyable somewhat challenging great art somewhat cliche story music overly emotional taste oris controls feel smooth thrilling moments overall prefer hollow knight ori ticks boxes average metroidvania fun time consider largely patient gamer occasionally buy games year release honestly much backlog theres rarely true sense urgency three one rule helping ease theres still far unplayed played column enjoyed ori blind forest enough though skip usual waiting period im really glad almost every respect much enjoyable game original ori blind forest already leapt way upper half personal top still improves upon remarkably solid bonesthe blind forest suffered pretty bad introductory hour two wisps doesnt get wall jumping pretty much right away double jump wall climb fun abilities introduced rapidly great effect id say actually solves problem fault get many abilities button slots assign natural synergies emerged blind forest lot clunkier ori loadout sorts means need choose three skills time awkward trip menu change means really want explore way chain things together end flowbreaking reliance ui guess blind forest required remember lot terms button combinations im convinced better approach also though im convinced worse given much improved flow ability acquisition wisps improves dramatically though one notable unbearably rageinducing exception chase sequences theyre shorter less mechanically complex generally feel considerably fairer original mean didnt end hating quite much one chase though aggravating dwarfs frustration anything blind forest play game youll know encounter excessive chases improved respect bringing boss battles contention really add dose innovation mechanics ori narrative pacing achieving key milestone play theyre fun kinetic offer lot opportunities use panoply skills upgrades bring foes slight problem wisps much combat oriented experience didnt really feel like thats ori needed best game enemies tools terrain exploited rather foes defeated combat satisfying dont get wrong enjoyed every moment exploring rich environments richly interweaving levels didnt need combat denser movement puzzles probably would better mewill wisps also noticeably ups production values graphically musically really im sure would believed realistically possible ori blind forest already visually stunning game id ever played yet wisps takes high watermark bashes airdash even higher reaches stunning every single level full backgrounds would happily hang wall animations baked terrain really push top like moving painting haunted soul orchestra reacts emotional visceral ways gorgeous movements ori real treat colours spectacularand ending hoo boy beautiful bittersweet emotionally cathartic way didnt expect tldr bit wisps phenomenal even emphasis gameplay changed still suffers obnoxious chases toolbox abilities hamstrung fact theyre hidden behind uiwonderful game overall though four half five stars could go great detail explaining pros cons think summed one sentencegame really amazing previous one couple improvements moment small bugs great could never thank friend enough gifting game art could recommend game music atmosphere alone gameplay solid boot improves everything blind forest incorporates better mechanics peers like hollow knight amazing experience could spend lot time writing game right amazing every aspect would faster watch trailers imagine game fun trailers look like still better expectationsi still tried write wall text erased think trailer looks sounds beautiful simply play game couldnt speak praise game finished hard mode yes one bosses quite dark soulsish hard game fantastic experience movement abilities make want pop relive fraction perfect adventure price id satisfied paid cried much expected towhat say except exceptionally good game welldeserving wonderful reputationfirstly story simply beautifully told twists characters make comback regardless lot new side characters introduced individuality even contribute little nothing story shows much love went thisthe music simply masterpiece atmospheric beautiful underlining scenes environments makes cry even harder respective

give game try worth anyone dont know game needs review worthy siquel deserved complements first game takes best analogueshollow knight best metroidvania enjoyed ori blind forest lot cannot recommend game state infirst nearly double price original top game breaking bugs preventing many others enjoying game enjoyed ori blind forest game admit might target demographic since style game actually something normally play really enjoyed first game found ori wisps frustrating due changes change allow kind manual save made unwelcome one sometimes found repeatedly struggling get past point without save location made experience feel repetitive repeat process second problem could change difficulty game played first game gave challenge able beat lot less frustration one may gameplay changed reduce focus platforming instead emphasis fighting boss fights fair realizing halfway im getting frustrated would like make things little easier kind bummer realize would either soldier start new game different difficulty setting negatives aside recognize issues may problem fans style game might actually positive game still beautiful heartfelt filled great music something would definitely recommend people enjoyed ori blind forest hesitated buy wisps therefore waited patiently bought game however finishing game ca hours hard mode say mistake went directly purchase game every penny worth beautyful design music amazing mechanics feel even better first part would recommend playing gamei encountered bugs none dramatic one first kind annoying boss fight second phase water rise happening respawning enjoyed honest prefer blind forest terms gameplay interesting npc characters good lot plus open world exploration feel collectibles im kind disappointed cant get without spirit trials cant time trials life depended chase sequences actually easier boss fights quite fun challenging enough ended getting lost several times though sometimes difficult tell ledge currently unreachable im terrible platformingthere graphic glitching audio syncing problems might due laptop exactly optimized gaming im willing let passcombat additions well see appeals people lack melee combat weapons wasnt much problem blind forest much fun bashing enemies around tossing projectiles back even throwing enemies directly spikewhich brings biggest complaint controlsthis may ive gotten used blind forest controls still someone enjoyed bashing enemies inclusion grapple importantly bound button bash complicated things often would try bash enemy get spikes thats often fastest satisfying way disposing grapple random blue flower didnt even notice grappling blue flower doesnt quite control bash bash pauses bit set direction grapple doesntanother complaint putting stick walls like toggle instead binding key like blind forest sometimes want stick wall sometimes dont esp frustrating say escape sequence inadvertently get stuck ledge wanted free fallalso might play style never really used half shards barely used non plot essential skills like boomerang sentry ended bit obsolete collected sake collecting itanyway liked preferred style story blind forest enjoyed playing game much happy see sequel first game ori blind forest excited see story continue let animation stunning first game audio matching songs match emotions tears flowing already ori blind forest suprise hard get engaged characters even villans playing game lovely experience recommend everyone matter age gaming experience game young old noobs pros anyone enjoy enjoyed blind forest cant recommend sequel doubt beautiful game great music polish spent entire playtime frustrated platforming caring combat first ori certain charm fluid pace sequel eschews combat unintuitively precise puzzle platforming every step way many times thought missing something important getting section must breaking sequence didnt make sense platforming annoying raging throughout game cant deny power human stubbornness reason finished youre good

already amazing world made better finished game say wow know lot people hesitant game quite changes mechanics game well im belief give chance find many changes quite charming ill try go changes pros cons without spoiling much first one major changes lack ability tree game opposed first game game gain abilities via trees similar previous game spirit shards differences abilities used time limited amount abilities equip using spirit shards might annoying found fun way sort sculpt game different play style amount shards equip goes play develop play style base mobility life gathering spirit light defence offence lot ways challenge build youre looking challengethis another way change play style suit person many different attack options gained used reliant one methodthe final differences mention challenges game ori faces many bosses form challenges challenges exactly challenge easier others meant carry form difficulty allowing utilize new abilities area found challenges fun find difficult given option abandoning challenge continuing rest gamenow things really start change game interaction creatures game many occupants forest able speak interact characters purchase additional abilities shards even maps originally wasnt sure felt change continued forward game found charmed adorable residents forest side quests sent werent obstructive actual game play felt like naturally mingled story quite lovelyso pros would definitely count differences pros game play managed pull away first game avoid copy still keeping charm ambience loved first gamejust like first game find wonderful soundtrack game new area enter met matching soundtrack ranges creepy peaceful solemn happy really feel atmosphere improves experience muchanother similarity first game wonderful graphics cut scenes actually get game game starts beautiful cinematic continues impress fact story beautiful first game find immersed game story cons amount soul light containers game provides like may like complete game completion finish side stuff well game would include purchases abilities shards upgrades associated maps upgrades well completed game normal difficulty even managed complete spirit races additional soul light another optional somewhat difficult task however still close soul light short able buy rest shard upgrades collectables already obtained option go back grind bit killing creatures get additional soul light needed previous game ended excess end game faced opposite game feel like needed extra light containers map players wouldnt feel frustrated fall short enough light end gameanother issue game still several bugs pc gamers effect immersion game play experience well know sound issues started game loud obtrusive buzzing sounds would completely ruin certain moments transferring file solid state disc found fewer obtrusive buzzing sounds still every instead would moments sound would cut second two every awhilei even glitch prevented using light burst properly shut game order fix noticed visual glitches nothing serious usually didnt take away actual game play itselfi also issue combat music continuing play area challenge despite challenge completed good music dont get wrong get annoying youre casually going area stuffas game recently released though hoping bugs glitches things fixed eventually though point definitely think ill jump game second play think ill wait id like much relaxing play without annoyance dealing bugsregardless bugs though still recommend game anyone played first game even havent although definitely recommend play first game beforehand better understanding loreand overall experiencethis beautiful game equally beautiful soundtrack adorable characters definitely game continue play future alongside first game finished game absolutely

finally play without noticing spent hours one sittingoverall love game might little bit biased first game one favorites far liked everything itthe visuals beautiful movement flows nicely combat tricky fun needs attention combat first game spammed left mouse keyi havent finished game yet cant wait discover story simply love like love whole life kind wish star rating personally enjoy game mildly takes lot features away hollow knight amazing thing enjoyed game personally like hollow knight regard highly suggest game really masterfully done congratulations creators honestly aware pc run however mildly heavier first ori know havent playing long would recommended game anyone first minutes alonethere words describe beautiful game brought tears several times virtue beauty staggering visuals transcendent music maybe thats needed something beautiful life right doesnt change amazing isi playing two hours already rapid approach becoming favorite game period good wondering game worth money answer would pay asking price see introduction first time againoh guess gameplay pretty good tooedit completed game second playthrough literally beautiful piece art ever experienced know people technical problems game ran fine one crash hour playthrough frequent autosaves wasnt big deal loved abilities platforming redesigned combat significant improvement previous title art music beautiful haunting though feel use much bloom lighting times story touching excellent game like game dont touch ground fun like didnt dislike anything product wonderful atmosphere incredible music astonishing graphics love every second like like added questing system little structure game without compromising style openness story exactly sequel like implemented way customize combat style spirit shards similar hollow knight mechanics great sequel great visuals great gameplay great story little short side still great like first game wont return game horrendously buggy many fps drops got ill rather wait fixed play right edit dont know update fixed issues caused adaptive resolution game semiplayable right idea turned reason default option enable adaptive resolution fucks pretty much everything upthe fps drops happening start number bugs fewer like crashes times force shut either ori stoped moving unable jump certain sectionsthe combat seems better unlike first game get useful perks start since theyre mostly ones first game feels lazy many useless perks number abilities equip limited retartedbut biggest problem definitely bugs cash grab feel game doubt anyone deny havent preorder single game years looks like would wise play games older year since games seem like always shipped half edit bugs gliches got worse later collectibles looked jarring story way worse first already genericly weaki really didnt enjoy time overall outside combat even though also limited pretty much aspects game downgrade first one really dont see much reason play like first game slightly better one good like game im glad developer managed keep quality high level nice music beautiful graphic storytelling smooth control give game highly recommended like product like game tobut play first game else wont make much sense like game entertaining like first ori still little buggy crashed ori glitched half dozen times would say going bother wait weeks patch playi find challenging ways easier others feel like story slightly redundant wont say dont want spoil despite feeling little redundant enjoyed game much far would say little taken hours get therethey changed abilities little bit way modular familiar hallow knight felt like modularity similar said wasnt fan hallow knights modularity feel balanced well means vary skills bit depending preferred style playi played first ori many times tell one fact bucks surprising feel like doesnt take terribly long get single play since play many times feel like good price point valuei would definitely recommend anyone enjoyed first ori enjoys game hallow knight hope enjoy much like game nice graphics nice soundtrack decent gameplay actually fixed stupid sand worm escape makes negative reviews rightly rage inducing impossible get without looking guides trying finally timed everything right got better second playthrough third try rather try like kind game really fantastic imaginative game superb graphics animation style excellent music cant wait enjoy liked ori blind forest never loved sequel however fixed pretty much minor problems first game added lot new stuff well changes ori become nearperfect experiencethe combat way fun one inclusion variety weapons though found bow conjunction spirit shards increased power probably strongest especially bosses bosses great though played hard difficulty better time think added challenge incentivized explore every nook cranny spirit shards health energy upgrades etc end collected everything game offer every quest completed construction gladebuilding glade also one favorite parts game loved creating glowing sanctuary middle oris dangerous unforgiving world really felt like helping characters within charming waysthe platforming always best part first game even better collect spirit shards gain methods traversal stay airborne quite use cleverlythe story sparse simple touching oris adoptive sister ku completely adorable unfortunately commission games length story beats revolving around ori family still effective especially opening ending scenes considering spoilerthe finale shows future seemingly distant oris family long passed seems like end storyspoiler id gladly play whatever comes next developers wotw orirelated liked everything game liked played game became one mother nature talked trees gave super powers liked story ending game liked first game lot find game much intersting liked game easy new players get graphics ambient invironmentartstyle absolute also great story though recommend playing first game one liked lot better first

currently haver hours clock plenty left explore dothe game truly masterpieceart design story soundtrack absolutely stunninggamplay simply amazingthe way use environement absolutely fluent pure joyi would absolutely recommend game yet decided buy go grab blind forest loved ori blind forest game equal superior literally every way content side quests better combat interesting puzzles even touching story highcaliber music visuals two didnt improve already perfect loved ori blind forest sequel much familiar continuation blind forest better still goodi think went bit far trying reinvent wheel combat revamp isnt good mostly due inclusion collision damage bosses collision damage would made sense combat style blind forest retained mostly dealing damage somewhat distance thats case real interruption flow combat especially since major attacks dont require energy melee strikes modify position slightlyother everything loved blind forest cool art style good music good puzzles fun platforming loved ori blind forest sequel takes already awesome makes better every way longer emotional story even satisfying platforming new ways move dieit also adds actual bosses instead pitiful bosses blind forest npcs auto checkpoints running energy soul link completely redesigned combat feel less like spamming x button avoiding enemy attacksthe game looks sounds better ever godrays new colorful locations screen space reflections varying perspective cinematics instead new soundtrack gareth cokeri thought couldnt really get better original moon studios managed pull alienating veterans original game loved ori blind forest yet like wisps played continued wonder developers trying get bit hollow knight mojo adding similar sounding npcs either way newly added npcs dry boring im still dizzy rolling eyes friends first game return waste screen time barely anything useful story powerful creatures game equally useless especially frog wasted potential dark takes world everyone gets depressed hunkers die get wayoh yes gorgeous world like painting actually like one must spend time analyzing find things around know many times lost track ori attacking sword adds effects lose track close enemies bosses super colorful shake ground completely lose track ori far biggest grievance game crazy looks gorgeous wish could change color ori red something minor problem first game seriously annoyingori equipped lot abilities focused sword hammer sword best way go since works scenarios however ori never close combat character first game right oris movements invite precision found getting close enemies far seemingly right distance swinging ori would get closer get hit aimed arrows air ori stop air could aim correctly would slowly fall frequently got way first get cool looking abilities like spear cannot really use magic wastage completely forgot time enough magic hammer awesome slow use could make main weapon healing constant instead select time minor things made ride bumpy die often bothered clunky abilities fighting mechanics weremusic good level blind forests epic kuro boss fight hoped something epic story similar good lacks starting bad characters liked shriek kuro blind forest feel speciali see effort put game larger scope first feel higher quality alas work complete give fair chance replay blind forest although conclusion see others different perspective recommend discount loved ori blind forest aesthetic atmosphere music story incredible however without flaws good thing ori wisps fixes almost every issue first game improving upon aspects loved story amazing tears multiple times music great first aesthetic atmosphere remained beautiful best change wisps made without doubt combat original game felt though combat scenarios ended spamming attack button enemies died trying stay alive course point still stands wisps completely fixed multitude weapons added cannot give game enough praise loved ori blind forest game goes beyond improving love even definitely top five platformers metroidvanias loved ori atbf really really looking forward like coronavirus stayathome gameunfortunately reviewers called technical mess right loved every bit game graphics story telling boss chases fumbling around pressing key possible get adrenaline much fun details background foreground gel really well together awesome game definitely recommend loved every bit game hurt ways didnt expect story wise challenged friendly way times difficult first one take auto save friendly addition aspects make lot easier keep alive combat getting particularly pointy puzzle loved everything bosses final boss enraging put game even completing quests getting collectibles ori sometimes complete forced scroll platforming sections sort boss fight great fun youre celeste speedrunner infuriating casuals like methe map best ive ever seen metroidvania liked rpg elements platforming buttery smooth finally get difficult bits satisfying man final boss fill sense pride accomplishment loved even first one ori loved amazingit also beautiful challengingthere sadly still sound issues im sure end sound cut freaked rarely happened heads well recommend game rage

amazing ive seen music graphics absolutely amazing addition got teary eyed first minutes like real man warned make sure run decent pc get good framerate harder previous one platformer doesnt mean run wonderfully everyones computer game gorgeous loved first game game pretty much still amazing level design art however maybe spoilers ending kinda pissed although feel like almost nobody else gonna

game far issues running either loved first one bought wisps immediately finishing blind forest thought lucky getting sale wish bought full priceim lost words great game ill try nonetheless simple straightforward story yet extremely touching combat platforming already excellent first taken notch several levels biggest change boss fights expectedly hard also diverse highly satisfying soundtrack brilliant replay since completing game negative think stutters frame rate drops experienced apparently fixed might alone however good sections game ran smoothlythis recommendation havent played first game even reading reviewsabsolutely recommend game would suggest playing first havent definitely enhance experience game loved first one far like first one better held weeks glitches performance issues right bat downloaded big patch today running flawlessly impressive heard loved first one really step far loved first ori game beautiful emotional innovative hollow knight released near comparisons inevitable however preferred ori due accessiblecoming current game world expanded became rich remains beautiful ever however cannot match predecessor terms emotion innovationthe first one introduced groundbreaking bash escape sequences cant say game try introduce bashburrow sand mechanic way late gamethe escape sequences become easier yes first one hard also gave immense satisfaction completed one time around last one sand worm presented considerable challenge rest pretty mehthere introduction combat variety however enemies pretty basic stick moves obviously focus ori games platforming however platforming game also pretty mediocre time around couple setups becoming challenging encounter towards endthe criticism seems lot first game piece art great gameplay still playable ever nothing attracts attentionif continue like cashing first game third game able succeed lot influences hollow knight imitation best form cartographer wish hadnt done took away npcs welcome touch made world health regeneration made game shards couple health regeneration choosing shard time made game incredibly easy normal difficulty able brute force even bosses fan first play second otherwise play ori blind forest first hollow knight next skip one loved game really builds ori blind forest started loved game much loved graphics beginning tutorial slow final boss say remember feather otherwise gonna angry definitly recommend game makes feel like really skilled little loved original even bought definitive edition almost right away released say excited sequel understatementso deliver absolutely dont quite know somehow managed described masterpiece managed pull sequel wonderfullywill wisps takes things everyone loved blind forest adds new things changes things keep fresh less expect good sequelthe story strong impactful previous although perhaps spends little time introducing world many features time around platforming also much satisfying enjoyable blind forest well arguably even moreso many refinements several returning game mechanics newly introduced onesto say thoroughly enjoyed game understatement regrets whatsoever paying full price im one people normally wait months even years get good deal gamesive seen people mention bugs personally havent encountered substantial ones cannot comment though notice select achievements mainly connected certain collectible items showed like minute two actually completed themso summarizemore less perfect sequel consider one alltime favorite games loved original game easily nervous going pull sequel fair mechanic changes like sort inventory system side quests currencystore system isnt microtransaction real money ingame system combat also reimagined sequel definitely adds lot way ori interacts progresses story let go gamegameplay soundmusic sequel outstanding good finished got chair gave standing ovation youre platformers metroidvanias need play loved original true masterpiece sequel ok bad game let compared exceptionally high bar set id give good graphics amazing stepped every inch every level brimming detail blends much better everything higher res far variation looks gorgeous boss fights overall better side quests nice additionand thats rest okaythe soundtrack amazing lackluster sequel bad memorable tracks reworks nothing new overall found boring doesnt evoke emotion still remember years later soundscape escaping ginso tree cant remember single track sequel finished like hours agowhile bash blast staple ori didnt like grapple far often wanted bash enemy would end pulling whole screen grapple point came fact grapple bash button annoying didnt even use grapple shard nearly every use grapple could replaced lantern projectile required bashing overly complicated movement reason apart need something new fortunately could ignoredavoided timethe sand dash really annoying overloading buttons mere excuse need something new whereas grapple annoying downright infuriating worm escape sequence frustrating enjoyed kuro escape sequence original enjoy challenge punishment missed sanddash ended normal dash pretty much meant shot wrong direction instantly died could normal ability could assign xyb could equip times sand rest game could swap ignore itlevel design felt poor many times unsure supposed somewhere needed ability many roadblocks could actually passed using clever jumpingbashing often found stuck places couldnt progress get indication poor playing unable reach place design never happened originalmany levels areas couldnt go without dying clear indicator spider level dont remember name particularly bad certain areas see fine magically explode reason without light mention perfectly visiblemany times found unsure something visual detail key point puzzle feeding grounds perfect example exceptionally frustrating background detail something need aware time found dying thought something part background wasnt viceversa glowing thing important yet another thing glows otherwise gorgeous landscape glowing thingsmost challenge game came defeating enemies platforming puzzle solving trying figure next basically trialanderror way game dying repeatedly fortunately spawn right back hard rarely found firstif jugglebash projectiles multiple times row put ceiling mere inches baurs reach horrible every waythe storyline dumb deformed armored transformer bird somehow magically fly kuro far intimidating interesting wishing ku would die dumb birdthe controller support infuriatingly buggy loved soul links first game cant help feel

solves problems first ori controls like dream get lot movement abilities fairly early game becomes fun explore bat art even beautiful first game hard top also doesnt get way gameplay see need go easily game however get used bash grapple button sometimes use one instead though think remap keys third party program ori wisps also adds complexity combat fight bosses time lot different weapons choose though get three slots attacks active abilities found sticking one two types attacks regular enemies also smarter greater variety attacks compared first game ori also gets number passive abilities collecting shards equipped depending many slots unlocked unlock extra slots completing combat shrines lot fun though arent difficult addition combat shrines also complete time trial shrines really test platforming skills quite difficult took many attempts complete lastly game offers quests net spirit energy use currency shards active skills complete game longer first includes main quest got lot enjoyment one difficulty starts bit easier first game later offers roughly challenge though noticed werent many instantdeath moments first game doesnt allow create save point however remains challenging standalone game fine recommend playing first know characters continues happened end first game played though whole game savegame say full confidence game enchantingly beautiful

least give one try really dont know managed surpass masterpiece ori blind forest years since last played first instalment series managed completely blow expectations away somehow made cry ori wisps metroidvania game expect heavy amounts platforming combat speaking combat since ori blind forest massively improved instead using wisp attack enemies take matters hands use array skills abilities environments advantage bstoryb cant really talk much gist ori ku owlette flown new region niwen encounters dying island ori save land stem flow corruption whilst simple premise journey along way really makes strong point game wonderful references first game look hard enough bmusicb wonderfully composed orchestral soundtrack gareth coker seriously take listen one best video game soundtracks ive heard bgraphics designb ori blind forest known stunning visuals even today hold pretty well years ago new updated unity engine visuals pushed even lots animation stunning scenery leave awe game stutters quite bit noticeable moving quickly zones leads bugs spotted none game breaking far gets passoverall favour buy masterpiece really dont know describe theres reason game positive review rate high incredible everything right soundtrack puzzlesolving like platformers slightest buy game really dont know say game soundtrack divine graphics absolutely gorgeous story almost made cry cannot recommend game enough parkour frustrating times still really fun cant really say much love game lot really enjoyed playing game starts simple keep earning many new skills way youre playing evolves keeps experience fresh throughout gamethe way open world laid works nicely coming back areas youve visited use new skills reach areas couldnt reach feels greatthe emotional story drags magical worldthe boss fights challenging makes finishing rewarding really enjoyed atmosphere soundtrack story great sad really enjoyed game platforming great combat enjoyable abilities fun use speedrun game visuals pure eyecandy sound track great really enjoyed game think blends good story great artwork visualy musicaly fluid natural movement combat mechanics make supurb experienceone nitpick sandworm boss could use savepoint seem graphicaly demanding needs think theyre rendering everything objects nessesary perhaps couldve done prerendered animations prerendered cutscenes could run lesser computers im developer knowregardless small complaints definatley worth full price really fun game lots find touching story well really like combat system game smooth like really like story moving combination game would strongly recommend people like solve puzzles really like game crashes oftenplease fix soon really like game please fix bug thank really like game metroidvania classic ways exploration somewhat linear cant really stray path meant played sequel much different first game graphics still awesome music breathtaking gameplay great yet still lacks something really like going much fun really liked blind forest wisps makes difficult return predecessor ori controls like dream especially equipped numerous upgrades make travelling even fun combined gorgeous visuals beautiful soundtrack musthave fans metroidvania easy contender personal favourite game year really liked least good first game mechanics gameplay elements working nicely level design liked first one recommend second part well really liked first one adoption hollow knight customization better first say least really liked games combat mechanics beautiful art story overly complicated refreshing ive blast way worm escape sequence almost impossible beat im hopeful moon studios balance sequence make actually beatable overall ive enjoyable time playing game would recommend really liked new skills features especially mini games skill shard system allows great variety individualization might come handy comes speedrunning parts escape sequences felt pretty precise appropriate beautiful opinion worthy sequel think everyone loved ori blind forest love game well everyone freshly stumbles ori universe fall love immediately really liked game feel lot like original times however times felt like game trying little hard like hollow knight iteration ori significantly higher level combat previous game isnt well balanced addition felt like lot ideas thrown game sake namely collectables dont seem much thing game short really enjoyed game higher level difficulty platforming sections even higher levels mobility wont see game would personally play original first pay extra dollars play one really love hollow knight really love story way game build soundtrack hits perfect game absolutely really love first one good better filled challenges exciting enjoy first one sure love game well highly recommend everyone enjoys advantage style games anyone played first must play game really love game sadly laptop spec almost cant hold recommended really miss puzzles first game still puzzles seem watered lot involve platforming skills apposed pure thinking game beautiful like first game noticeable blurry blockyness background sometimes rather jarring running game fantastic good first game still good thoughi thought new weapons cool almost never used seemed pretty useless used sword hammer spear almost exclusively also switching weapons couldve done better thinkthe lack skill tree imo best move use bunch slots basic abilities like third jump kinda felt like got cheated understand itthere bugs around quest markers disappearing completion pickups respawning cannot pick also got stuck reload previous save avoid area completely later gameoverall game excellent followup previous ori really really love game really recommend game story line graphics feelings occured playing game unbearable obviously minuses expect arent honest someone would like play definetly buy also blind forest know whole context enjoy even moreapart really wanted tell changed life many ways first joining whole ori fandom community felt like finally found happiness life moreover managed meet great people also created version spirit commissioned various artists make results incredibleto sum everything opinion must game beautifully made well worth price really want like game really doori blind forest masterpiece patient enough wait definitive version could play best loved game cried much story enjoyed variety game mechanics flawless level design made every feature useful tangible way ive played game four times still find going back morewhen heard going sequel excited course immediately put top

low frames per second sometimes suddenness tear chasm flow game subsequently ruin immersion even application running oatwotweven worse game begins miss input events coming controller especially middle combat challenge theres nothing quite like feeling impotent frustration one experiences watching ori slowmotion sailing gracefully facefirst sharp end skeeto despite pressed held repeatedly tapped button assigned attack hopes ori something anythingin contrast performance issues oatbf relatively minor could mitigated reducing quality settings many players first encountered flowbreaking performance issues ginso trees escape rush quick tweak aa setting needed make level playable exception rush sequences rest game played smoothly oatwotw graphics settings look like might help already switched feel powerless mitigate performance issues adjustments sidethese issues combined make parts game unplayable ruin experience game enough id rather stop playing wait definitive edition hope performance improvements well player control quality settingsmoon studios really love done ori franchise definitely back issues addressed though cannot play game current state able experience would intended please keep us apprised performance issues fixed expect able experience game meant experienced really want like game really want complete fun like first one consider one favorite metroidvanias problem lost identity ori game point proceeds try live predecessormy primary issue game abandoned much made first ori fun instead tried hard fit stereotypes modern metroidvania added combat keeping oris slippery graceful movement beautiful ends frustrating fun savestates removed return forced combat bosses dont feel fun ori doesnt dodge iframes game tries way hard different metroidvania primarily hollow knight yet clings tightly original ideas ori makes fun enjoy feeling running gliding around ori world dangerous trappuzzle ridden actually fun really want love game theyre done patching runs smoothly probably stands slogged hours buggy platforming cutscenes absolutely breathtaking truly ori franchise masterful art music composition storytelling jittery mess witnessed enough make cry even graphics lowest settings case thats problem even restart yes killed final boss twice see would improve final quality cutscene frustration entails see astonishingly beautiful game trying dont recommend game yet devs clearly love though give month three fix issues game perform supposed ill get back really want recommend game cannot game still issues risk softlocks sound stutters furthermore found story less compelling also think character models dont look nice environment game still beautiful nice extra features like ori something otherwise would recommend wait patches really wanted love game really unfortunately suffers fate sequel movie loved story formula wont spoil anything youll see changed game mechanics basically stole hollow knight shards shops upgrades npcs map guy etc addition npcs around maps utilised anywhere near potential thus waste time interacting like wtf point bird guy improvement combat sad true still good game compared last masterpiecethe devs took lazy approach feel really wish could give game positive review doesnt workby mean upon reaching certain point game computer overheated due graphical stress turning settings makes differencei potato pc play games like valorant overwatch rocket league league legends without even worrying graphics settings ive played many platformers past celeste hollow knight neither problem frankly look better game id give reason expect game causing even looked minimum specs wouldnt educated computer let repeat absolutely cannot run game meets specsif computer isnt fair bit specs game waste moneythe point breaks isnt immediately area game called spoiler wellspring glades afterto left meeting builder guy first time spoiler recently brought game already finished story strongly recommend game everyonei really enjoyed playing game game extremely fun play got fantastic graphics great touching storyline bgm charming afthis game spirit called ori trying save world darkness playing game feel oris emotion hes carrying heavy burden paste saving world stop even lost closest playing game find shards unlock skills buffs explore world unlock secrets really benefits although

recommend game even touching game nominated game goty reward recommend game really everyone enjoy vivid gameplay fights action see game piece art value music design enjoy taking time discover large world full hidden artifacts cute little side quests played ori blind forest well didnt think possible game developers managed take one step recommend game adults case child want play child would watching gameplaysoundtrack beautiful plot like okhowever game mechanics heavy beginning easy hours playing became really heavy kill monsters recommend beautiful art style story soundtrack would buy remember playing hollow knight impressed whole recognized solid metroidvania blind forest also fantastic lack luster combat questionable skill tree systemwill wisp fantastic metroidvania good combat removes skill tree also destroys hollow knight combat map system level design badge system hk better bosses challenging platforming basically like hollow knight game make think kinda lame remember found ori blind forest back pirated since didnt money spend steam started playing fell love artstyle gameplay music played hours uninstaled said want give money people made worth ori blind forest amazing game saw trailer wisps got hyped said im going buy day comes euros lot money head said would worth game opinion fucking masterpiece definitely one best metroidvania games basically upgrade ori blind forest new concepts added like charm system hollow knight various weapons buy upgrade also abandoned exp level point system would use level ori instead used currency like souls dark souls geo hollow knight combat one fun unlike first ori game click mouse furiously actual bosses one movement fluent fun story magnificent shed tear technicall issues expirienced lot sound errors probably fixed clipped trough floor visual bugs like teleport animation plays twice minor ones big step original means double masterpiece thus gets saw recommendation first game series aesthetic looked appealing saw sale bought itmy initial impression game serviceable felt responsive since start pretty much nothing comes bit bland within half hour pick number extra abilities spoilers feel game transforms serviceable butter smooth game provides incredibly enjoyable sense control character feels greatafter couple hours playing numerous amount abilities items get provides substantial feeling mobility joy play pacing game good allowed acclimate new abilities unlock become incredibly proficientthis could compared many games hollow knight celeste metrovania feel game also provides polished experience within genre lend certain amount uniqueness havent played game gripped like good feel say yes gameaudio bugs quite often early onother ive normal incredible experience shall say really enjoyed game stepped first ori cool im writing review huge frustration learning expand number equipped shards finishing game clear shrines couldnt understand dont get anything fact need pick shiny thing unreadable least also learned warp almost location completing game yeah think game needs clarification gameplay mechanics maybe theres still something didnt find spent hours collecting stuff didnt want end stand awethe best beautiful game played many many many old many years keeps going hours started crying credits rolled many emotions game controls amazingly platforming feels natural combat massively improved since last game flows well ori feels good control story amazing develops beautifully unfortunately short game bad viddygaming skills completed easy hours ingame longer first game adore game would give could started game hour launch even first cut scene looks better first games game visually pleasing look sound quality throughout gameplay cut scenes crisp clean story wise comparing first game creators amazing job creating new world us explore game masterpeice given try everyone still cannot believe theres even space ori blind forest excelsior new scenario completely overwhelmed previous masterpiece graphics upgraded another peak could hardly reach music brings dream world wonder several years ago exciting part new weapon system evolves ori real warrior master martial art story love idea loop fate warm shelter dangerous forest much easier horrible silver tree moon studio deserves name masterhowever something lost untold new scenario didnt bring affection much previous one even simple tale well developed complete frame whole world figured nothing origin evil spirit corrupt water clear view sandworm think background complemented side quests graphics ending though epic enough unforgettable abrupt somehow unreasonable mean develop theme life death love requires much cushions close bond characters linked say ori wisps one greatest games alive satisfy expectation flaws plots unfortunately pity masterpiece still recommend stumbled game discovery queue immediately interested especially reading reviews game let beautifully made vibrant graphics really made side scroller come alive music everyone says amazing story brought tears multiple points ending story made actually cry husband laughing game really sucked hard put game play challenging best way really think try lot different things certain points get lucky continue one best games spent money long time worth every penny think going jump back time play first game duo next think know everyone cries play game freaking hardits difficult imagine perfect game ori blind forest getting better somehow moon studios ityou need play ori games incredibly rare find story told heart coupled gameplay constantly challenging youthis series remind reasons love video gamesjust buy think im person saying prefer original first foremost combat game feels like attempt adding depth however navigating weapon use battle often hampers pace especially apparent fighting boss want switch weapons pause chose weapon ability button want use actual combat feels disjointed likely either spam abilities dodge isnt much room aggressive result variety combat focused looks compared feels animations swinging lightsaber supposed faster weapon long liking compare game like hollow knight combat much fluid fast paced need remember switch weapon abilities also much depth despite using sword nail spells charms ori charmlike system really change play game much hollow knight ori might get spirit shard changes weapon works hollow knights charms allow stand still swinging nail changes health bar entirely even give pets aid combat game best makes think best weapon use given moment part game stops wanting play also problem minutes one keystones wasnt loading reload saves found understand seems like negative review actually enjoy game visually stunning sound design music also great movement far best part game fluid also keep mind ive playing hours first impressions rather review might play dont know anyways dont let stop buying game described scares want get game buy keep mind probably experience rather games fault yeah thats first maybe last impressions game id give might seem kinda low keep mind still opinion quality game worth time kinda reviewed game bored share thoughts since game flaws conclusion like see go get first impressions think great improvement first one combat system first needed bit getting used much prefer old one think easily one best games played long time long time since got invested game trying best search every nook cranny possible till achieved man feel good theres much sequel better first game absolutely beautiful music gorgeous visuals fluid gameplay biggest improvement might add making wonderful experience beginning endthe thing really holding back absolute masterpiece would couple bugs technical issues would pop though often easy forget indulging every aspect game think best describe compared first one havent played first game ori blind forest highly recommend wont miss story per say expand moveset learned throughout gamethe score new yet familiar still best ive ever heard gamethe game tiny bit shorter easier hard tell might im use bash mechanic introduced first gamethey added seems like double cut scenes story rich compared first one definitely feel purpose every task next yes cried first one youll definitely cry onethey outdone inventive new abilities reinventing new ways use mechanics youre use old game wont give anything away introduce sand game new medium traversebottom line wont find fluid intuitive platformer megalovania around visuals gorgeous game amazing job making feel like badass youve pulled string great perfect easier turn made feel shorter comprehensive must buy think game beautiful emotional really didnt want stop playing gratifying unlocking new abilities fighting decay eating away niwen think game everyone hope people pick since price good also please play iori blind foresti first familiarise cast characters hoping people love want third game ori series thing couldnt get hang spirit trials seem optional think first one better daughter loves liked first one youll like get repetitive bad could lot better seeing good first one think sequel heavily inspired hollow knightand thats great visual music combat gameplay topnotchbut story little weaker mespoilerspoiler hate ending tho spoiler thought would never enjoy platformer many years playing games saw many glowing reviews give ori try im glad game truly something special interested enough reading review go ahead get thought wouldnt like game im much platformers game absolutely amazing ive played games one best games ive

performance issue solid game would story didnt disappoint thought ori blind forest couldnt improved upon game worthy sequel keeps great first game expands traversal combat way feels good thought ori blind forest best gets wrong thought blind forest perfect wisp much better im loving everything ever wanted platform game thought impossible top blind forest thought platform games cool age gaming man ori wisps proved wrong great game nephew also enjoyed thought original ori pretty good ori wisps tried hard love game much loved first canti still recommend hard decision give thumbs upwhy soit many things right like first game graphics sound athmosphere level design spot always want continue figure progress get around next obstacleand thats exactly game fails sometimes gets seriously frustrating never blamed first one mistake ive made lot one controls far dont feel precise fights pure button mashing luck slots different abilities attacks may nice shooters dont think concept suits ori game well neither trading side questsit would nice kept game simple first thing leave open world elements outall lot fun sadly also quite frustration end theres sadly one verdict dont think im ever going play played first part least three times doesnt offer much fun thats struggled give thumbs without really thinking itabout bugs encountered handful glitches along way never came across something seriously bad effect something like thatim looking forward seeing moon studios hopefully go back roots keep simply fun typically dont like platformers one gets absolutely worth price probably fun ive game whilealso soundtrack fking amazing usually dont write reviews given enjoyment game would like make one support developers bit maybe help people decide would like experience game hopefully find much enjoyment first sequel played one though would recommend playing first one better understanding lore stories needed recommendation youll understand playing one extra details fanservice lost translation said much succeeds sequel takes best first game expands polishes make overall broader bigger better experience game story good setup heros tale david takes several goliaths vast platforming world play little white spirit much larger enemies variety landscapes challenges come emotional desolation level first one story good progression within well done meet lot different forest characters different kinds backgrounds needs contribute atmosphere positive way antagonists well done serves grander purpose area youre exploring story absolutely great miss desolation first gameplay absolutely loved gameplay first ori one expands polishes makes feel fresh brainer first game one type attack next using enemy projectiles one brings light swords hammers bows spears variety others upgraded points gather exploring enemies slain adds urge exploration game shines beyond expected next shards passive abilities choose useful amount used upgraded battle shrines face waves enemies platforming ohhh platforming absolute joy play game progress become faster better precise agile within first hours regain powers first works perfectly sequel level design every single pixel game sight

much man master art moon studios masterfully used make every area feel perfectly way would justice something hear understand difficulty dont score subjective score ill put three difficulties say think easy want play story platforming might still take getting used forgiving experience finish easily normal recommended designers way playing offers decent challenge beginning platforming becomes less forgiving enemies become easier progress unlock weapons good experience switched hard hour missed challenge hard personally like challenged die times push perfect next time trail error succeed perish combat becomes bit brutal especially early stages changes get used enemies variations meet later feel progression system game shows best learning curve nuisance becomes easy pickings get better platforming especially spikes unforgiving gather life points gets easier still challenging bosses fucking brutal hated felt sense achievement learned moves beat mode game shines although understand everyone overall close perfect game see points improvement things wouldve rather seen done differently found significant flaws imperfections waited game years fully hyped excited would become

spike basically energy bolt throw enemies really elevate feeling action game bash improved overall loved acrobatic feel conrols game mechanics tightened quite bit general time since played first game easy forget clumsy controls really felt like fighting lot time many abilites like stomp dont even work half time activate dont even intend wisps everything feels flawless tight responsive always felt like control dying ori decided wanted skill development completely overhauled better skill tree pretty limited abilities didnt even seem match branch tree triple jump arbitrarily branch dealt mostly energy efficiency example purchasable abilities level different shard slots allow customization abilities vast improvement lot game compared blind forest first twice long also bunch npcs scattered throughout world give side quests different rewards found really enriched world added lot experience game people complained story actually loved particularly end thought great one slight qualm one

wrong game shed tears least makes happy still able connect journey ended truly hope theres series come wasnt huge fan first one game fixed issues blind forest took ton important cues metroidvanias since feels like hollow knight ori thats good place wasnt aware possible get prettier ori blind forest legitimately dont think theres game pretty one jaw droppingly beautiful one games along hollow knight blind forest would present average person say games art really cannot overstate beautiful game isits platforming tight first game favorite mechanics made back amazing bash new abilities slouch either interestingly shares mechanics hollow knight shards lot like charms hollow knight combat wise ori took multiple levels badass able fight weapons made lightmuch like first game tissues standby must soul crushingly sad game points overall havent bought yet wasnt expecting game well developed along graphics price point definitely worth every dollar spent wasnt expecting game good blind forests original release solid felt like missing something adding laser swords huge hammers making combat suck less making game even silky smooth patch really boosted impressions game game took away awe doom eternal good worth double dip xbox version wasnt sure going improve upon formula original basically took everything loved game music art style fluid platforming cranked took stuff didnt love much first game combat story improved well supposed criticize game great buy play issagudgame wasnt sure original game could topped proven wrong improvements combat mechanics platforming wonderful felt natural use learn always soundtrack absolutely stellar gareth choker outdone said game perfect time writing review quite bugs prevalent game missing audio buzzing audio certain inputs working properly whilst would definitely recommend purchasing game would maybe wait patch fix bugs dont hamper experience wasnt sure could make game better first boy wrong game beautiful took everything good first game made better went back boatbfb boatbf deb preparation sequel far probably greatest sequel video game ive ever played ihow much enjoy game incomprehensible highly suggest get game liked predecessor iuin honesty menus freaking pretty lot genuine fun watch slowly fill game progresses u ithis prime single player experience went expecting jolly good time game slapped feels definitely recommend anyone wants go short rich story simply say better first one even possible amazing game skip obvious mean see game gorgeous fluid constantly motion everything also hear amazing music played first one know well story triggers full range emotions anything done even better artistic masterpiece obvious pretty much anybodyhowever game would like talk gameplay game simply feels good every moment spent playing ori pure enjoyment fluidity controls matches nimble main character leaves feeling like b b one soaring magical forest combat step previous game orders magnitude beat game hours since done lot playthroughs form relaxation game difficult times unfairly extremely fun playas sequel game builds already impressive makes bigger better every wayso wandering worth hesitate undoubtedly piece art also core amazing game wish could like really many people love see hadnt sold first one decided go ahead try anyway since heard improved much got sale unfortunately misses mark methe things lovethe controls amazing love ori moves fluid responsive really joy run jump around without slowing especially get couple abilities make much funthe visuals beautiful love art style used really whimsical really feeds worlds wondersunfortunately thats kinda stops mefirstly combat theres lot youd think shouldnt issue much walk screen come back enemy killed back plain nuisance wouldnt problem combat even enjoyable isnt button mashing isnt funsecondly gameplay boring never ending running back forth even actually puzzles painfully tedious trudging back forth plain isnt fun especially paired boring also tedious combatthirdly story really isnt much one know im playing blind since played minutes first im pretty sure decent enough idea story regardless bad normally would totally acceptable paired otherwise boring game play cant hold upoverall whenever pick play feel bored like im trying push ahead see anything interesting happen never doesim far feel like im enough hours interesting nowi spent money dont waste game im going keep playing itbut honestly would wait till least buying wish didnt job wish could home day nothing play oh wait wont spoil anything might interested game beautiful story twist end perfect wisps almost perfect sequel ori blind forest theres lot emotional parts game admit teared several times throughout game plan playing must play game sure play first moon studios please make beautiful games like would highly recommend game anyone like metroidvania style games platformers story interesting art amazing great game expands gameplay original still making everything encounter feel fresh fun go literally played game strait days would highly recommend play game well done stand alone first game ori blind forest ori wisps forever hold special place heart became favorite video games ever playthe thing wish changed weapon selection mechanic didnt pause game rather ran slow motion would say wish hollow knight silksong would sequel good game first ori game would like developer pat back creation masterpiece would recommend playing first game one although first ones combat might tad bit clunky one arguably fixed combat system similar hollow knight despite changed art style amazing movement game feels different slightly less emphasis though increase combat game amazing definitely worth buy especially enjoyed first one would say outset part games would make smash controller boss fights arent especially difficult platforming sections genuinely infuriating also feel blind forest better save game system checkpoint system really helpful certain sections said still enjoyed finished game improvement many ways combat oris movements really melded art level design music really strong games match level refinement fondest memories game exploring around map payoff completing certain sidequests ending really controversial seems really liked way ended heartbreaking wrenching see end surprised story general pretty grim despite colorful gorgeous art design cant recommend enough never play platformers glad play game id give game game good bit combat focused previous one new story beats took hours first playthrough tried thorough glitch rendered sidequest unbeatable also couple minor glitches found funny entering certain cutscene air launching ori map randomly launched back liked first one wanted bit go wanted bit combat beautiful art style definitely go ill returning isnt fixed soonwhythe sound absent game keeps crashing workarounds expensive best crapshootdont blow money something doesnt work delayed releasegive follow wait hang money ifwhen fix get ive doubt actually playable itll wonderful experience mean sequel blind forest ill give hatchet honey reviewthe cons framerate stuttering high end gaming pc brush demands games requirements shoulders like dust luckily im experiencing plethora bugs negative reviews claim getting guess im either lucky one sideperks high end pc less chance bugsthe pros im hour half soundtrack already bringing tear eye quality first game top notch probably going top contender goty ill start two important disclaimers first technical issues faced decently long ordeal even get work first patch didnt work desktop pc update reinstall finally works moreover laptop ramhdd game still unplayably stuttery beta branch first patch even though patch reported improve stutter issues personally suspect main culprit drive machines slow hdds run greater risk unplayable experience thankfully least specific issue obvious right start refunding possibility youre stuck note though major issues got game work enough smaller reports issues may worth waiting patches game isnt high priority youfor second disclaimer heavily heavily spoil first game ori blind forest pretty much already first two minutes blind forest also great game havent played yet wish play games go blind forest firstwith way game platformingheavy metroidvania main appeal ori series lies two fundamental pillars first pillar games ungodly good art sound metroidvania im aware comes even close art quality prequel games supported emotional orchestral soundtrack top tier among games ive playedthe second pillar appeal sheer movement ability playable character gone even sequel already couple hours game platforming abilities top speed would feel absurd platformers capable player fly screens unimaginable pace retaining control speeds tough every misstep momentarily stops pace game essence dares see fast move tools gives youfor sequel changed obvious point combat combat rather simple first game sequel attempted make indepth still although combat parts indeed far better still clearly secondary compared platforming component terms enjoyment major change theres far npc interaction sidequests well far nonlinearity freedom exploration compared first game especially latter half game also far prefer story sequel first game point may divisive among peopleoverall game essentially mechanically improved blind forest already topnotch game begin ill write longer review later sum fantastic game sequel im fan original definitely delivers larger world lots fun characters good story overhauled upgrade system think really nice also nice game actually marks collectables youve seen cant yet getive ran number bugs nothing game breaking well without restarting client maybe times total im huge fan ori blind forest bought moment releasedso far graphics music exactly expected moon studios controls beautiful mechanics changed bit takes getting used nice see something new game rather rehashing exact formula originalthat said game requires lot processing power original pcs pretty old bit tweaking able get running hiccups choked lot getting started far hasnt impediment game play fingers crossed stays way im huge fan games game incredible soundtrack ever heard matching visuals makes awesomethe downside think minor moments graphics kill pc freezes besides top notch im huge fan first one went sequel high expectations totally exceeded lots attentiontodetail things added upgraded battle system thats complex yet easy switch options somehow even beautiful first one game stuttered froze times imagine patched soon obvious game labor love appreciated every minute interest genre favor pick im absolutely love games music level design graphics new combat systems definitely step first game feels lot action based im absolutely infatuated game already adored blind forest world gorgeous story moving gameplay absolute bliss wisps different respects ways goes beyond predecessor scope ambitious world filled much personality detail phenomenal level design around short theres really nothing dont love game personally ori wisps flawless game im crying game amazing im finally ready leave review game investing around hours getting achievements done im finally freeit sheer awesomenessstory left heartbroken twice still feel tiny void inside hearti loved ending thinking world someones else
