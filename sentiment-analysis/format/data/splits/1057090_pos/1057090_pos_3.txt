wrong tastei action dude love compound vr doom etcbut game piece art character world music story masterpiece games reminds started play games love themwell ori moon studios thx trip pure emotionsso boys girls take headset pump op volume let game first havent played ori blind forest would highly suggest playing game first makes one much easier play since youll need master dynamic controls abilities presented ori order really explore nooks crannies gamethat said ori wisps worthy successor blind forest continues story unveiled first game picking left myriad cast bear mind much story visual games highly visual fact many times games necessary explore story order open new areas might otherwise seem inaccessible youre big story might feel like game lacking disagree since brevity soul wit many times arguably less much lack words dialogue made oris world feel like ambient sprites vibrant terrain feels exactly like extension first game novel differencesim hours game point im loving cant wait beat holidays mario meets castlevania one thoughtful games genre thanks xbox studios moon studios bravo first sorry english isnt goodori tearsits fantastic game simple emotional storylinethe gameplay smooth sometimes bit challenging get hang fun playthe background graphics beautiful soundtrack masterpiecethe downside game bit short still decent lengthbut beware emotional side game otherwise tears fall first game amazing lot aspects unique well different first ori though blind forest never feel powerful something keeps invested throughout game dont feel strong relative enemies environment control insane movement thats blind forest strength ability chain movement elegant flows went rooms wisps feels different record played hard start platforming really really good theres much variety technique amazing go one another fast like first one glide across rooms without touching ground way easier get point one especially since get solid half movement abilities first game note got triple jump super early made bit fun something recommend changes game completely lets super fun skips collectables cant really sequence skips basic kit im sure lotsomething want note stole bunch stuff hollow knight bad thing hollow knight one favourite platformersgames time something youll notice played map system similar dialog characters something added characters talking apart spirit guide basically hk noises visual style final sequence almost eerily similarto biggest change first one combat overall combat amazing mob fights fast paced intense fair general one ones flexible entertaining however leads games biggest flaw boss fights bosses blunt terrible like boss fights lot especially hard ones im good damage bosses hollow knight radiant forms beaten data org secret bosses crit general hard boss something love game bosses wisps annoying disappointing boring bosses ive ever faced first boss straight one worst ive ever faced patterns bad bad hitbox floaty combat system dont feel fun fight theyre pretty platforming section thats really good overall theyre satisfying fight played game bounty reckless skills increases enemy healthdamagedrops bounty increase damage takendealt reckless straight turned bosses went cheesy arrow spam strat normal attempts frustrating bosses fight wanted bosses legitimately thing think bad game handled combat well even though pitfalls thought theyd spirit bash ridiculously op get start game massive damage stuns enemies overall really enjoyable make really hard ability switch weapons skills fly make really cool varied combat mobs fun bosses garbagethe story overall good emotional start investing gripping midpoint start act good wish committed spoiling villain good solid motivations actions shames shes introduced late game moki cute first grew annoying shame interesting start turn dumbasss quite quickly little expository dialog theyre thrown side characters better designs brain cellsoverall fun game good secrets metroidvania style map level design good side quests something else added average good combat beautiful visual worth playthough tldr adult owls assholes first game absolute outstanding music graphics story controls fantastic beautiful game play perfect sequel ori blind forest creators really honestly interest playing game make sure play first one one regret first offori wisps basically first game better liked first game mustbuy game feels similar overall also brings lot improvements table importantly actual combat well boss battles fastpaced feels good opinionas lot collect lot youll gathering currency various upgrades going story even designated sidequests interact npcs complete tasks placethe manual save point mechanic present anymore doubt anybody going miss itas abilities previous games movementbased abilities return also new ones along combat abilities arent tied progression howeveranother thing thats returning first ori escape sequences felt easier time around though story similar previous game still different enough liked ending wellmusic graphics beautiful youd expectthe environments cases extremely similar first games still fresh feel course new mechanics introduced well first offthe first game hands one best games ive ever played secondthis game tops ori blind forest every aspect first part set bar pretty high scond one didnt dissappoint oris would buy first playthrough definitely blast feel though done bit story seems like moon studios also wanted alas fell bit short long arent running integrated graphics quality art outstanding gameplaywise definitely improvement blind forest combat techniques encourages spam sentry took sein away also similarities hollow knight mechanics attributes seperate comparison unlike people think iits really fun game depletes soul away attempt deathless order get achievements wayyyy less instadeaths blind forest actually manageable thats plusthe snowballthe snowball first playthrough hardmode times super frustrating also super rewarding go get nostalgia feels first playthrough experience gaming quite like two ori titles wholeheartedly suggest stop reading reviews watching promotional material go right ahead play prosjust like first game art style graphics world nothing comes close beauty game offers visually combat feels similar except weaponspells system complete overhaul allowing pick different weapons offensivehealing spells pleasethe spirit shard system welcome addition allowing equip trinkets change stats provide movementhealing abilitiesnpcs personalities instead spooky voices telling story general feel lot involved world world first get see similar world desolation people still trying get live best canthe platforming rather easy begin gaining lot abilities experiencing new mechanics certain areas game throw decent amount challenge theres one consistent thing always feels consistent satisfying move gamethe pace new mechanics introduced absolutely perfect againthe story yet beautiful disheartening ultimately bittersweetbrating first thing say see hollow knight influence addition full fledged bosses addition sword attack moveset almost pixel pixel knight easy see personally think great slight shift pure puzzleplatforming adding complex combat might turn offthat said level design amazing every map twists turns every way seamlessly hidden paths accessible upgrades game note design map visually stunning area feels distinct unique even areas passageways identity colours feel upgrades interesting one hand abilities first game came back one hand blind forest ability tree three branches unlocked sequence one three ability slots nonessential abilities pick choose abilities want bring though least change fly combat received pretty substantial revamp gone spark light following around shooting enemies time around ability wheel separated previously mentioned ability slots multiple choices normal enemies found levels fairly simple completely ignored however big addition bosses big occupying good portion screen entire bodies deal damage touch variety attacks patterns need master order beat story simple degree rather predictable beautiful captures unique way storytelling combining narrator recounting events almost silent actions emotes characters music words easily best part game even without knowing anything game could listen music understand going oris mind music playing ori blind forest ori wisps best music ive ever heard gamemy one gripe game young owl pictured cover game right together ori game never lets play little story would loved see game dedicated parts owl maybe give chance switch finish story alas first things first recommend game played previous game ori blind forest since think game like ori terms platforming mostly going compare game previous one think changes made improvementsthe negatives bad changesi dont like spirit light system changed previous game found every collectible game went every combat trial still missing spirit essence end game order buy every map upgrade shards stupid game shouldnt require grinding upgrade everything game first game enough experience fully level skill trees without even finding secrets isnt much annoyance dont think introducing grinding platformer good idea biggest complaint game easy normal difficulty hard platforming areas game replaced bosses think paper fine however wish longer segments game difficult platforming segments positivesgood changesthe shard system awesome able customize build throughout game although shards nobrainers made feel like could evolve strategy game went much preferred level system previous game next great thing course music visuals didnt think could make previous games environments better wrong area distinct challenges segments felt unique part map favorite area caves beneath need traversed using light goes die soon thematic crawling spiders approaching angles darkness another great improvement addition characters although game doesnt best voice acting thought writing excellent made character distinct personality gameplay remains relatively unchanged abilities added however never overwhelming like choose abilities max since adds player agency game overall think game took really good first made even better would highly recommend anyone wants great storybased platforming challenge first time played hours gone like nothing amazing game wait keep playing blast streaming feedback even better great job team im love entire game music everything first sound tried hdm nothing web searching ive

heartpounding great time playing game im looking forward future installments love challenge games game best u anyone didnt play predecessor ori blind forest highly recommend playing one first cheaper shorter fewer abilities get used generally less difficult like first ori youll probably like second one anyone played ori blind forest youll probably love one case changed expanded upon roughly twice long completion hard without hardcore achievements like one life original movement abilities multiple new ones lets zip air ever becomes necessary many sections much higher focus different combat abilities fast melee heavy melee fast ranged heavy ranged theyre viable play biggest change absolutely dislike platformer combat check gameplay videos first difficult hollow knight another big change manual saving really took getting used autosaves frequent never lose considerable progress worries also multiple autosaves shouldnt able softlock save escape sequences one far difficult blind forest supposedly toned bit since day writing review bossfights alongside escape sequences theyre awful dont get oneshot anything spirit light currency use buy upgrades basically like get new combat

abilities felt purposeful like dashbash upgrades new powers used specific area never appreciate ability play way want id like mandatory items consistently useful throughout adventure metroidvania know thats hard itd nice shame control scheme didnt allow use unlocked moves instead forced cycle timei small tech issues launch hopefully fixed soon progression updatingsaving properly twothree areas stuck even though everything restart game get items already collected reappear map still didnt get achievement midway final boss even though save file already said sometimes ori looks aliased compared environments lots weird buzzing stuttering first moved game onto ssd never happened againoverall great metroidvania oddly easy compared first game definitely good entry point new subgenre progression

knight badge system map maker even summary screen track game progress caterpillar homes even though caterpillars overall feels like art direction took priority gamplay difficult rate highly ripped mechanics quick time events odd design decisions bprosb extremely pretty sorts things environment waving wobbling full life pass really beautiful soundtrack new mechanics first game like platforms covered blue moss new combat abilities amazingly fluid animations especially ori flips around sticks grabs handstands top poles spins around double jumping traversal really smooth unlock abilitiesbconsb heavier focus combat tons new abilities cant use get buttons abilities one needs main attack probably want able heal leaving one button several different ones needed platforming platforming far easier new movement abilities game full cheap tricks designed kill like portals dumping top spike pits pits youre meant jump poison bottom deadly things slightly offscreen youd know avoid less focused first game map littered side quests irrelevant icons moki dont offer quests still marked map controls good still bit floaty nearly tight hollow knight ripped hollow knights charm system map npc quest summary screen boss design subpar something actually could improved copying hollow knight show boss going provide way avoid damage dont give boss different abilties dont put chase quicktime events middle boss fights quick time events scripted pieces get really tiresome really quickly one bits move hiding place hiding place dozen times couldnt tell next hiding place game focuses pretty rather giving visual hints parts scenery background whats needed gameplay hollow knight wisps good hollow knight betterthey took ori blind forest mixed hollow knight art work nice gameplay felt like rerun hollow knight except goodoh absolutely hated timed run boss sections hollow knight kind scared metroidvenias one much betterplaying game felt like chore one much fun hollow knight ripped game like years came would get stomped owl hollowknight wispsthis game truely feel like successor first ori suggests appears followed hollowknight correctly implemented game great results new checkpointsave system much better last one combat much better beforethe bugs exist encountered mileage may varyi highly reccomend avoiding hard mode unless skilled combat played game blindforest least enjoy pain suffering like game easy first hours finally get boss inflated hp way change difficulty start game unless start new save redo first hours uncertain normal difficulty finally beat game yay main suggestion game able change difficulty midgame since effect inflating bosses hp many hours players might get trapped difficulty give another suggestion seperate grapple bash buttons share button

music graphics challenging soul destroying best feels really good play recommending game great sadness enjoyed mainly ori enjoy mechanics core mechanics felt like poorly engineered emergent gameplay making feel like bugs exploits times made difficult determine skill using progress area whether actually able oris current skillsetthe feel game even feel remotely similar ori since save system makes game absurdly easy actually regret playing hard mode played normal mode though buggy mechanics able tell strategy would work made game difficult enough example platforming ghost races extremely difficult times skills would sometimes activate properly one area would extremely sensitive another case main reason would recommend playing hard mode combat since incredibly cheesy boss fights took tries typical enemy nuisancethe charm system side quests interesting whole game reminded hollow knight ori still dont really know feel im expecting definitive edition release problemsbugs fixed rebuy kind regret buying gametldr game enigma wish could recommend yes buggy doesnt feel like ori probably rereleased definitive edition anyway play story maybe watch youtube lets play want play mechanics would recommend time guy gets emotional games game made cry touching story stunning visualsthis game must play really amazed story game graphics whole game story simply beautifuli supporting developers game amazing work bmasterpieceb really disapointed combatfocused boss battles platformingfocused gameplay anymore new systems feel like different game guess minority wanted gameplay first
