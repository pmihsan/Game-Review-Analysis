another knockout moon studios animationsgraphics art design simply top notch audiosound design oh course story emotional heartfelt executed simple profound beats main difference vs original view one little extra polishing well elements similar ive seen hollow knight namely lots different equipable weaponsupgrades allowing varied playstyle one point bench felt hollow knight well perhaps intentional nod adds elements without really sarcrificing core gameplay original would describe movementfocused platformer anything elseif minor criticisms would really cant find reason ever switch abilities like basic slash could see switching basic slash like heavy slash using game havent found convincing reason switching trying new weapons regularly even could able equip time feels limiting want use spinning cross energy weapon spear would mean giving basic attack maybe one essential movement tool weapons meh im finding story beautiful predictable follows first story quite closely overall theme perhaps change one far nothing surprising new really top notch happy give guys money great escape chaotic times another masterpiece moon studios like original however like original one glaring flaw blind forest gameplay mechanics wisps audio bugs moki sound effects hiding shriek sequences resetting random audio hickups hereandthere hopefully fixed future patches another masterpiece moon studios fluid fun movement challenging level boss fights terrific soundtrack awesome story whats love game thing think would made game little better would little time playing ku either ku ori

alt tab click main screen best game year far boss fights arent fun ori games flawed sure feature gorgeous visuals smooth controls make sure play gamepad games completely centered around analogue movement might enjoy merits alone first game original unique quite rough difficulty wise point got frustrating ultimately didnt enjoy game stingy health drops create ration save points using mana run mana long hard segment somewhere deep inside spike filled tunnels well theres going lots repetition finally save againand sure enough difficulty common complaint made sequel easier bmuchb easier wisps game autosaves roughly room eat spikes breakfast get powerful healing ability right first area restores lot hit points pittance mana thought maybe game would pick later areas never beat whole thing like deaths compared first game sequel longer game sure soaring around areas cool abilities fun much youre face rolling everything never really struggle basically exploring looking cool stuffbut wait added proper combat bosses yes time around get choose actual weapon instead spamming homing orb picked hammer start game turned far strongest weapon game deals massive damage sends enemies flying even lets stomp ground sending shockwaves quickly dispose enemy groups needless say steamrolled whole game swinging damn thing like great hammer build dark souls big stick goes bonklate game bought weapons nowhere good got thinking bnotb pick hammer would found game frustrating would combat difficulty right ill never know hammer also one two weapons break cracked wallsfloors hold many secrets collectibles throwing spear eats lot mana hammer requires bnoneb theres literally way break wallsfloors pick wrong weapon miss secrets andor combat becomes much harder questionable design choicedue way healing system works bosses rarely threat mostly health sponges theres usually constantly respawning mana crystal boss room let heal damage take boss patterns simple highly telegraphed usually attacks repeat might chase scene beforeafterduring boss fight nothing crazy first gamethe first ori game often compared knighturl seems like developers took competition heart sequel borrows blotb hollow knight even whole areas mechanics spoilermouldwood depths deepnestspoiler bit blatant times mean theres even cartographer npc spawns area sells maps equippable charms act look exactly like hollow knight default sword basically acts like nail hollow knight etc etc felt shameless soulless mention mechanics borrowed hollow knight dont feel anywhere polished dont fit well wish developers focused oris strengths precision platformer instead diluting platforming difficulty much trying make game play like hollow knight ori games make great platformers unique art style enjoyable play though boss chase sequences frustratingly difficult often little margin error said enhance sense achievement final succeed multiple attempts ori titles beautiful games fun jumpnruns ever played

run bugs made certain segment wayyyy harder needed another made restart game thankfully wasnt save data ruining ones encountered cannot recommend game enough audio visual glitches game solid part gameplay really impacted much anywaythis game makes feel many different feels selfrespecting lover story needs play capita di rado che quando un capolavoro di qualunque genere abbia un seguito questo sia allaltezza del primo capitolo questo gioco non solo allaltezza di quello spettacolo di ori blind forest riuscito addirittura migliorarsi ogni aspetto comprato visivo mozzafiato colonne sonore da lacrime e ora anche il gameplay migliorato parecchio con nuove strumenti missioni secondarie davvero non ho parole per descrivere quanto questo gioco sia ben fatto che chiedono quando va sconto non potrebbero essere onesti specie se li valutiamo relazione ai che chiede un aaa medio di scarsa fattura grazie di cuore moon studios per il lavoro che ha fatto e che ci ha regalato perle come queste non sono facili da trovare voto il minimo se vogliamo essere relativi ai voti che vengono dati ad altri giochi ori arriverebbe tranquillamente certainly better first game visuals stunning soundtrack par first game well gameplay much better game since improved combat aspect main focus still platforming pretty fun single runthrough would say big weak point probably boss fights theyre either boring easy even theyre hard arent designed fun way challenging entertaining levels beautiful map art design top theres music cant give enough credit gareth coker composer master masterpiece reminds likes jo hisaishis ghibli animations ori games remain gray steam library music linger mind decades come challenging game play accompanied excellent graphic soundtrack challenging platformer beautiful art music improvement first game leaves room another good length irritations design flaws challenging expertly designed beautiful moving one perfect gaming experiences challenging impossible times beautiful

difficulty interrupt flow make masterpiece genre added side quests collectibles time challenges items abilities shards keep going even completing main story keep exploring even completing game impossible ori blind forestall buy worth every penny complete overkill certain point oni never understood generations fetichism astoundingly ridiculously difficult games admittedly theyre style long permadeaths timed runs whats point prove maybe reflexes slowing maybe im age things enticing importance anymorethe game unsurprisingly absolutely gorgeous albeit point places map information screen lot take music say least incredibly moving even meditative certain placesthe thing contrarily blind forest wich fair design everything twotw completely fabricated screw hardest way possible may sound obvious blind forest tough could get rules place wich game never broke patterns wich figured felt absolutely logical rewarding achieving progressfrom certain point twotw feels like overwhelmingly winging everything claustrophobically becomes big game trial error without intuitive trait game winging everything youre winging right back figure game wants wich becomes tremendously tiresome confusing blast first hours became big game guessing winging trial errormaybe game finds way back fun fair play ahead keep going find become big mess point care anymorethe game despite previous patches remedy issue also still noticeably dropping fps certain actions locations effectively optimized complete rewrite reviewi purchased game release day performance bad occasional shuttering even though computer recommended spec frustrating stopped playing whilerecently brought geforce super replace shuttering ridiculous official recommended requirements stated list better gpu would upgraded gpu earlierthe game mediocre best handful skills three slots assign level design constantly requires three skills traverse platform fighting enemies requires constantly pause game switch skillssome skills completely useless required solving puzzle one particular area mostly useless otherwise skills lead good game also needed frequently pause game see map even though run area hundred times screen shows small portion platform quite hard recognize whole picture screenthe story uninteresting reason remarkable villains first game ori blind forrest tasked solve situation deal annyoing gumo later facing kuro solve situation simple remarkable game many characters many enemies enemies suddenly brought fight without prior introduction defeat enemies gone unimpressive easily forgettable ending unsatisfying suppose cliffhangeri try solve puzzles without seeing walkthrough one area couldnt figure solution horrible gimmick explained game hint located numa pool dont spoil much stuck try randomly attack something water might solve puzzleit took hours beat game according steam fall asleep leave game running without playing occasionally boring brute force everything hoping action might solve puzzles except numa pool puzzles fair okayso recommend game wait sale completed game today thought beautiful game love setting platforming movement abilities fluid fun use combat pretty good beginning bit tough get used youre trying figure hitboxes wont hurt game progresses get ton different combat abilities allow vary like fight based style visually stunning lots places explore collect

open new styles escapes normal level played last one battles really deaths per battle final one least story touching drawings musics best ever seen marvelous sequel far exceeded initial expectation strongly recommend one everyone completion took completion ratingi say despite combat platforming individually harder nuanced previous game whole feels considerably easier new checkpointing system problem metroidvania incentive explore offset difficulty finding useful upgradesunlike first game put onus play savingand also limited ability combo attack giving player reason hunt energy capacity
