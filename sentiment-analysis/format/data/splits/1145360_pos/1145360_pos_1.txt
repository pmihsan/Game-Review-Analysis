roguelite gameplay supergiant finest smooth zippy hell someone actually enjoyed transistors gameplay fair amount massive jump think please anyone might put previous supergiant combat systems real complaint game tended make fingers wrists hurt longer sessions hours sheer amount inputs pretty high times bif play game regardless whether use keyboard gamepad please favor take breaks b im seriousi still havent fully completed game seems takes whole lot final boss victories launch tell ones gonna last long time considering ive already thrown solid hours time writing review got tons longevity previous supergiant games im little disappointed lore isnt made inhouse really big deal supergiant fans guess im happy present depict play around ancient greek mythology damn funthe soundtrack art great though opinion fall short previous supergiant games standards lots bangers battle themes tend great long dynamic dont get wrong things feel lot consistently decent rather good huge standouts previous games still good stuff though visual art side things vastly prefer painterly style bastiontransistor sort transition lined sketchiness pyre hades thiss fine sprites lot better environments step transistor pyre still good portraits expressiveoverall great game second favorite supergiant one behind transistor love roguelites definitely pick liked bastion transistor definitely get cause blows combat water finally heard game fence urge give try went expectations pretty much right middle supergiant game without unique lore premiering epic games sounded almost like gonna phone honestly blew away addictive fun exciting play iandi watchupdate jan gone postgame game ive found quite holes great first attempt roguelite supergiants style feels fittingly amateurish points main issues games progression way gameplay handled handledthe progression maingame postgame slow padded hidden sheer wit games dialogue isnt really enough fix final boss defeated times get regular ending epilogue requires variable amount time due based partially rng took around hours reach epilogue even knowing exactly access ridiculous since maingame closer hours long less estimatepart problem lies games apparently praiseworthy character interactionsdialogue pools yes lot content yes usually fun read listen honestly come point comes across excessive nyxthanatosorpheushypnosachilles complete chore talk slow inconsistent quests player either kill repeatedly pray theyll get dialogue prompt want thats character even available everyone listed besides hypnos simply appear believe time gone playable content readable contentthe games actual content progression inconsistent well unlocking weapons takes almost time yet unlocking extra aspects significantly timeconsuming especially one takes account secret aspects actually leveling things mirror night fairly balanced costs bit expensive side completely goes deep end bottom buffs meant like icing cake jump steep enough bottom buff alone costs rest mirror combined resourcegathering ridiculously slow nothing game scales much regard one must complete entire runs higher difficulty last obtain copies rare resource makes later house hades upgrades unnecessarily timeconsuming difficult prophecies help dry near end postgame common resources really better either scale even worse majority maingame darknesskeyesp treasure rooms basically dead rooms much later upgrades make key rooms good treasure darkness ones remain nearly useless pitiful rewards getting max hp elysium isnt helpful especially amount darknesstreasure obtain still entire rooms dedicated ways make common resources faster get bonuses either fairly low weapon auras reliant rng poseidonchaos boons former doesnt even always applythe final nail progression coffin postgames title system based estimates would take well hours get enough darkness max title isnt even counting maxing mirror night add already put hours game gotten almost everything hours sake hard ludicrous also unfun theres anywhere near enough streamlining farming resources let alone progression systems side last anywhere near long singular pointless title system yes titles intended random side thing doesnt much doesnt excuse far end progression systems id guess itd probably take another hours completely max everything ive missed outside titles leaves nothing repetitively grinding nonscaling darkness rewards already limiting gamethe limitations game another aspect needs mentioned mentioned games padded still fun sure lacks much variety feels less like playing bunch new experiences every run like im playing rooms game offer bosses face figuring optimal aspects weapon using others feels pointless weapon plays ways boons fun play around similarly player finds fairly optimal sets around end maingame maybe even earlier theres really much increase difficulty brings one last thing lack practice simulation please supergiant add boss practice boon sim mode theyd legit help players familiarize instead needing turn wiki immediatelybtldrb still solid game overambitious overhyped sg needs scale things back next game hope also please play transistor reviewed reaching end patch fantastic roguelite dungeon crawler made one favorite indie studios even early access game jampacked content multiple weapons addition different variants weapon upgrades allow interesting combinations destroy everything already fastpaced game character god adds something new run music makes world feel much epic intense highly recommend gameedit postlauncheven better spoiler freei fan supergiant games since
