sequences runs hades starts son hades zagreus fighting leave underworld must travel fathers kingdom gain freedom much like roguelites concept hades deceptively simplebut long players fail quest pass zagreus sent house hades players start interacting court hades first run house hades little empty theres course hades cerberus faithful hound players also see achillies goddess named nyx well hypnos nyxs offspring time characters appear obvious hades based greek pantheon gods gives player chance son hades also able interact meet many famous figures greek mythology many gods show zeus poseidon athena also famous figures greek mythology theseus sisyphus characters show hades also provide interactions every character hades small discussions zagerus theres always something talk whether story elements life appearance ingame zagerus exploits even zagerus currently story roguelite sounds like minor feature hades actually strong central part experience characters hades greek mythology also lot say contribute overarching narrative still roguelite players intended play die repeat hades also reason actions well characters found caring beating game also doesnt end story instead adds complex narrative several characters situations playing time part kept coming back first win also keeps interested time character shows see might say time story strong part game fifty hours theres still lot content even epilogue working towards story go far especially roguelite roguelites intended played multiple times players work towards goal hades excels hades works like many games players expected dodge attacks strike back enemies players take one six weapons dungeon run six weapons style sword aggressive group also contains special attack push back enemies spear allows players throw spear return players hands actions damaging enemies bow gun fists act might expect however personal favorite weapon shield feels like something captain america including ability throw shield ricochet multiple enemies hades broken rooms players progress areas room reward player item end battle battle challenging also wellpaced become completely overwhelming giving players choice reward comes next room helps give player agency move dungeon players often run gods olympus progress dungeon one bestow boon zagreus amount upgrades usually increase zagerus power provide benefit help survive dungeon theres also hammer upgrades change weapon works minor way players seek sets upgrades make way dungeon hope getting strong enough reach end however run upgrades removed zagerus must enter dungeon fresh yet still rewards permanent upgrades obtain currencies found dungeon darkness mirror allow zagerus unlock upgrades also increase survival rate combination learning game unlocking mirror upgrades getting boons players make progress hades underworld perhaps reach final boss maybe even triumphing actually accomplished around run even ive played least runs went back tried game scratch still relatively hard hades isnt game rote memory focus perfecting game rather game watching character grow become powerful one day accomplishes unthinkable even point hades isnt done instead gives player chase whether new challenge favorite weapon hades provides difficulty mode called pact punishment players choose optional challenges increase heat level earn rewards different weapons theres always something new random factor means two runs ever feel theres also something magical hades difficulty never gets easy also never challenging players feel like arent making progress challenges hades welcome breath fresh air game thats satisfying roguelite fans fans new genre hades also remarkably addictive point ive struggled put game constantly want play one round suddenly missed bedtime couple hours didnt happen twice rather multiple times week following weekeven beating game addictive quality yet dissipate twentyfive dollar game ive already put fifty hours thats good sign fact thats expect amazing roguelitebut theres one last fact really makes hades shine struggle really find issue hades gameplay extremely tight engaging theres huge challenge welcoming nature game including god mode make hades progressively easier necessary theres story keeps interested game also gameplay makes sometimes skip story get next big fight amazing moments triumph success even fail want return fight

deckbuilder slay spire monster train supergiant great job coming interesting upgrades build variety game theres enough way weapon upgrade choice systems wont get stale easily think theyve done makes traditional third person arpgs like diablo poe look uninteresting comparison story works well characters pretty good aesthetic mostly looks good although character designs little point real criticism boss countvariety complete run fighting four bosses first one one three varied movesets second one mostly final two always know meat replayability supposed come trying new builds new weapons putting
