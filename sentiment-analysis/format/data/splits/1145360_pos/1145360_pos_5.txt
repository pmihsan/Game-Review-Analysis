personnaly itwhich good amount hours fell bit bored game bosses mobs know easely combinaison worth notexpect average per run youre dead bit long think especially look number combinaisons bit unbalanced weapons weapons purely simply broken completly useless mean real pain play challeging pain conclusion good game expect gameplay main story really like roguelite games always present challenge master beat games either hard make play indefenitly never master others full extras content replaying hassle comes hades amazing artstyle music characters one tell game crafted utmost care love mythology satisfactory characters mostly true origins still interesting likeable seriously say nothing bad game absorbed completly beaten twice first try im still going strong looking story character development interactions gods best game year cant recommend enough specially roguelike games greek mythology really like roguelike games general hades takes cake great weaponskill variety feels like isometric hack slash gameplay loop addictive fun love game really like rouge like games must admint feel really grindy altought ive played hours feel like progress hades faster feels faster due different interaction characters love italso visually incredible really like artsyle gameplays fun storys interesting far really like design gameplay fun frustratingly hard really like effects feels like true rogue like looking like rogue likes ive played really like game story progress doesnt feel frustrating dieits also lot fun test different weapons kits really like graphics art game play voice acting game clearly lot effort poured making really like overall design game feels like combination diablo slay spire pact punishment weapon aspects etc add tons replayability game feels like still play game even hours combat extremely fun addictive really like rougelike dungeon crawler genre one didnt game feels like chore play rather rewarding grind top sometimes upgrades make cant even see enemy animations cant tell dodge attack come far side screen ive dashed forcing take damage first two stages easy complete feel like busy work dialog completely forgettable weapons upgrades dont really change gameplay much combat always dash attack dash attack repeat clear room stopped playing hours got dull quick really like game soundtrack artstyle gameplay everything would recommend everyone likes roguelikes really like game play nearly hours fantastic game play story decent dialogue hilariously witty fun follow testament well folks put together great talent game game bastion transistor etc voice acting point music expected best really issue game resource gain vs price items albeit cosmetics outrageous attempting unlock everything would take years kind cheat mode playing games time forget youd happy beating game weapon quitting watching youtube videos scrolling wiki see specific decor looks like seeing different relationship progressions mean consider many diamonds come across use upgrading things eventually need certain story progression happens maybe enough playthroughs heat random room triggers vary outcomes keep grinding point game longer fun chore unlocking music point also becomes tedious chore get rougelites get like especially content haveoffer honestly want forever grind play maplestory warframe recommend game worth price want everything offer better years dedicate anything adjust trader prices resource gain doesnt feel like year long grind get one characters hearts general increase number resource gain progress elisium seeing gems next room usually makes wish died start knowing im going get bullshit gems overall game fun rewards progress way slow making run meh sake grind write review praises game time bashing growing absolutely boring endlessly draggy grind days equates lack fun degree really like game style game art controls really well put together really like game worth every minutes really like game really like game really wasnt anything initially expected first play kinda go flow whatever happening anyway dying isnt necessarily worst thing game every time die improve stats time continually improve way challenges may beat expected immediately return boss example enemies help developing fighting skills effectively huge bonus someone like often kinda panics fight anyway art stellar characters likeable played approximately half hours game think play enjoy summary really great far really like game id definitely recommend like roguelike games really like game fun really like game theres something look forward inafter every run character interactions lot fun ive playing little every day week recommend really like game game really nice art style coupled fact gameplay fluid makes interesting gaming experiencethe part intriguing though story game told completing several runs talking several npcsi would definitely recommend game current state lot replayability really like game play gamethat really like game great characters story line game play soundtrack challenging honestly thats half fun really like one supergiant game though thats suprise really liked binding isaac one recommended storywise game pretty amazing genre usually get little focus gameplay characters one though fleshed interesting listen main character zagreus especially interesting like devs managed make witty without snarky annoying indeed never thought would get attached characters roguelike gameplay also lot fun get six different weapons infernal arms customize upgrade number ways items collect dungeon upgrades basic things like increase damage speed weapon others significantly change function means easily discover number playstyles interest also boons get various gods well dark powers one playthrough different another theres fair variety enemies though unfortunately many types see binding isaac even many quite challenging require different strategies favorite fight probably last boss stages fun really test techniques learned one however bit tedious due high health though fight really test build im particularly good types games even lose hades always come back sort items use slowly become powerful short dont give even think part area impossible eventually stumble across combination powers completely game changing people like roguelikes probably enjoy one never played one get hooked story atmosphere great way begin exploring genre really liked really liked playing game gameplay story also sometimes characters saying quotes makes funny give try gamethanks game really liked combat bastion game seems recapture essence add bunch new twists course roguelite format game also breathtaking art music full voice acting two thumbs would give nectar super giant games really liked effort put giving characters engaging personalities make want keep playing get know side characters betterthe rotating mechanics keep game interesting every run fun casual binge gaming really liked visual style game bosses change based difficulty wanted variety levels really love rouge like games game looked even though reviews positive didnt think would good boy missing literally perfect rougelike actually fun even fan genre recommend trying totally worth moneyupdate cleared game first time meaning ive started love game even really see much ive progressed something thought impossible actually quite easy really love playing game game build differently every run synergy different skills really fascinating sometimes get really nice synergies dish tons damage sometimes hope game drops better propsalthough stopped playing already still miss game hope developer could extend game even possibly add perfect ending love se hades getting away underworld really love artwork game well voice actingbut really gets soundtracks really nice game really love story mean dialog really seems like progressing thru something really love variation dialogues every time start beginning againfailed escape attempts beautiful rich character world design really love game really love game really well done graphics sound amazing really love game played hours dont even get boring theres always something new discover every run opportunity play trust finished buying really love game love gameplay changes every time based people encounter choices make boons receive genuinely feel stronger game progress feeling victory bosses really rewarding storytelling wonderful gg really loved bastion transistor game pretty much instant buy rougelike genre starting anew death exactly cup tea frustrating times also satisfying beat odds get much farther devs incorporating death narrative makes even less frustrating sometimes found wishing die interested characters sayi loved greek mythology kid still occupies special place heart really enjoyed fresh modern look classical characters still didnt manage beat game mostly due fact pride doesnt allow enable god mode make game easier people like experience whole story game still much worth gameplay smooth dynamic story simple yet gripping art music top notch expected supergian game really shouldnt listened judgment famous internet people shall go unnamed wish put thought written formthere nothing negative say games core design art story aspects least decent well average video game especially coming indie studio art story perhaps stellar art style spin old greek mythology surrounding hades art style also bleeds visuals graphics strain eyescombat weapons distinct facilitate different styles combat daedalus hammers increase diversity adding boons creates interesting diverse ways dish damaged enemies foes rather basic mechanically varied numerous enough create challenging scenarios challenging indeed precisely immense diversity ways build zagreus ultimately means nothing good player youll narrow choices essentials stay alive grab athenas dash grab hermess dash grab boons daedalus upgrade biggest damage multipliers take spiked collar keepsake grab many centaur hearts furthermore weapons best strategy taking potshots staying mobile bow rail dashstrike dashing like madman rest latter begins physically hurt time reach boss least experienceeconomy hades deceptively deep grind especially considering reliable ways get resource outside limited bounties might wonder didnt use god mode well began using tad late failed attempt even damage reduction increments death meant next nothing stroke luck good hammer upgrades boons escaped never escaped fact need escape numerous times fully enjoy story grind economy also disappointing ultimately lead negative review much like ridiculous economy also grind easy mode wonderfulwere runs shorter enemies beyond tartarus less health combat didnt put enormous strain fingers perhaps might recommended hades others dont well kind game stay away save torment fooled dont really suck game however great fun afaik really accurate greek mythology aswell really wanted love game pretty writing better games isnt high bar hades cleared solid play control great variety weapons talents problem funthe game far reliant rng kind order get build going actually feels fun play maybe disservice playing hell mode id cleared standard mode seemed stupid continue mode wasnt full game doubt would mean every single run mirror image last incredibly boring runfor example multiple

creates immersive feeling game world main issue game actual gameplay game described action roguelite often compared examples genre binding isaac synthetik etcthe roguelite part okay guess procedural generation diverse pattens time beat first boss took attempts probably see every possible roomenemy combination like progression system builds fine nothing crazy like roomful familiars exploding bombs instead tears isaac game also provides less random upgrade options like choose reward go blessings choose etcaction part really bothers dont know came idea isometric view dashbased action well mixed together isometric view really makes hard undestand whether enemies attacks hit viewing character enemies perspective cant really always understand angle attack coming whether dash synthetik isaac much easier undestand take appropriate maneuversthe second issue actually good part game artstyle hades world characters really beautiful details visual effects making easy understand whats actually going screen maybe sometimes hard see enemies attacks bullets mess melting point elysium world dim blue enemies greenbluish floor arrows flying thin purple lines blend environment actually supposed react cant really see itboth issues combined renders action part game unplayable getting hit something comes weird angle barely distinguishable environment frustrating dont see addressed without
