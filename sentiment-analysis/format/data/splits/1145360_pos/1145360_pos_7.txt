aspect game wasyou see close everything game offer first runs everything beyond grinding snippets lore electing add challenges runcoming gate combat fast fluid easily chaining varying types attacks used amid dashing around arenas lightning fast paceearly combat exciting flurry attacking dodging learning arenas abusing terrain advantagetheres progression systems place slowly advance strength character however systems accentuate problems see game namely lack gameplay depththeres final boss final boss entire game youve beat times game doesnt really changesure theres still weapon upgrades theres system place let add various challenges run end run wont seen anything new mechanically id contrast roguelite games like binding isaac granted isaac progression pretend thats case examine core elements individual runs boi metric ton items change way every run feels based items happen findhades doesnt thatthere handful upgrades much smaller handful interactions occur upgrade realistically expect see per runthat moreso anything else gives game incredibly flat feeling youre playing game mechanics youll quickly start asking whether youre going see anything new wontthat brings us lore spoilers lore seems real main draw game thing advances repeatedly pummel final boss theres tons lines dialogue every character throughout game comfortably state theres dialogue exists game length youre likely see character repeat line dialogueso want fun highspeed game short runs metric ton lore game youhowever want deeply mechanical roguelite game keep surprising new fun combinations abilities effects experiment perfect many runs isnt going scratch itch overall game designed well likely get better add options contentpositivelooks amazingstory dialogue pretty goodchallengingsmooth combatnegativecould use unique boons enemies overall game good voice acting multiple dialogues little details feel like well loved game developers players alike like ending disappointing game felt quite lacking ending whole olympus storyline thrown window quite easily gameplay aspect roguelike compared rogue likes like farm much get bare minimum required complete run many farming runs get basics either include method get farming material allowed runs opt getting gems purple gems useless run anything make ruins synergies get clouding rooms either runs farming runs get top atleast obligatorily abilities get also quite limited meaning combinations synergies abilities andor boons make game interesting make win run used boons epic duo abilities legendary boons although first may think lot options reality boons useless useless boons cannot saved others little synergies game needs interesting synergies instead adding useless boons overall game absolutely amazing three hours writing phenomenal well incredibly smooth gameplay always want play one round far round provided something new constantly keep interested like rougelikes games like binding issac game overall one fantastic roguelikes ever played everything different weapons different specialties bosses fight changing course playtime keep things fresh interesting definitely see delving least hrs game overall good game lot combat becomes repetitive pretty quickly story amazing voice work make overall great game amazing artstyle pretty solid gameplay definitely worth ones timemy serious points criticism grindyness way farm titan blood close impossible unlock different weapon aspects without repeating steps resourses diamonds gems okay rewards go towards completing storybased parts game titan blood directly affects way play run therefore pretty disappointing use remainder unlocking weapon aspect realising doesnt really suit playstyle essentially beat game times difficulty definitely game designer cince game still early access believe least offer ways solving problemthe first thing comes mind definitely dailyruns maybe weeklyruns rather exist popular roguelikes binding isaac nuclear throne hades specifically serve different way playing game also way earning rewards way see weeklyruns could slightly difficult kind run slight modifications erebus comes mind great way explaining

goty awards praise game getting ill agree art style gorgeous music slaps voice acting story top notch gameplay fun addictive starts get repetitive really fastnow know rogue like game asking repetition genre like asking hamburger doughnut shop im hours writing escape attempts successful using cheap op strat learned within first hours playing ares curse pain aegis dont see reason use boon weapon combination foreseeable future besides looking mix tedium going world environments time used weapon boon combination damage output would pale comparison using one boon buffing ever living shit pom power damage upgrades dont know balancing oversight im sure better combinations exist simple easy pull find ridiculous simple build effective way found chip overly damage spongy enemiesthey try mix things adding new dialog death escape attempt really clever way using genre narrative tool ive seen gameplay side adding new room mixing one boss fights adding another health bar even adding random trash enemies room makes already cluster fuck spells explosions even chaotic seriously sometimes much visual pollution screen cant even tell boss im suppose fighting wait smoke clear continueoverall nitpicks still highly recommend game fan genre figured leaving clear honest impression amidst pile fanboy praise might shed light someone looking objective finished game escape times attempts opinion hasnt changed much found couple weapon combinations funny boon effects mix part ares boon still pretty broken comparatively one cought surpsire wasnt friend mine getting would probably tried since

deepest game im way beyond satisfied im pretty horrible video games time one good enough story lore draw like excellent book ive started playing game im moderately terrible enjoying heck hades honestly cant say enough good thing game gameplay keeps engaged even skilllevel rocking highly variable soundtrack gorgeous art characters background scenery oh research greek mythology wellenough im

really fast grindy every aspect game actually theres real difficulty spikes meatier numerous enemies occasionally odd annoying abilities make chore kill every ability made useless replacing abilities rather increasing ability might want keepall say pass game full price maybe even pass halfi feel like overpaid overblown clicker game important property roguelike game replayability runs lets see hades handles every run different vast variety weapon upgrades boons benevolent gods temporary upgrades shops together form insane number unique builds unique experiences also game keeps surprising every run brings something new new enemies new upgrades sometimes even new every run rewarding like seven different currencies accumulate runs spend various ways improve zagreus progress smooth every
