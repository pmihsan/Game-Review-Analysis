everyone else underworld world feels alive game ive ever played dying doesnt feel like setback feels like coming back adventure catching friends rivals passing nectar casual talk voice acting gods voice acting possibly best ive ever heard almost every line delivered way text actually holds back writing little bit ironically far every character ive met practically exploding character charmi almost nothing positivity game small gripes like heartseaking bow much better weapons start adamant rail kind meh also experienced light performance issues game would freeze random intervals seemingly

fantastic vocal performances later theres story found quite enjoyable mining greek pantheon get characters presents fun way seeing eyes gods nothing extraordinary mythic voice actors great across board welcome surprise games like would opt purely text based dialogue however way presented one first main issues runs spend time house hades unlike roguelikes want run run hades forces slow run sometimes feel like quite chore barely lost final boss dont feel like sitting around listening minutes dialogue get chance go back try furthermore almost entire story told runs apart exposition small character building told static locations run hub kills pacing combat fast frenetic become quite drag slow much runs especially even full run isnt long character interactions however usually pretty fun always got excited talk characters showed hub one issues also stems story based approach supergiant took roguelike necessary failed runs one personal love idea run winning run roguelike never quite know stars align get insanely powerful run however present hades late game whole lot upgrades skills really important parts runs unlocked later frustrating know even good run early likely destined fail final boss also note runs feel frustrating early game lose something important enter new stage low health know keep run going good really run nothing itoverall think good roguelike worth time
