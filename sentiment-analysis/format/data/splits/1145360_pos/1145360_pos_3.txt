late last year immediately drawn world aesthetic art music fantastic dialogue really amazing voice work kept coming back day day fantastic core game play massive amount builds make carry end lot fun get run extremely unconventional powerful buildthe sense progression addicting tons fun little cosmetic items doodads buy place start fun add charm start get little bit resources run whether live die eventually get stronger unlocking new weapons aspects alter weapons function resources level aspects also mechanic give small buffs eventually add make much stronger however balanced system gradually increasing difficulty system called heat buffing enemies making protagonist weaker really coming back increase heat gain rarer resources game harder lastly reason think love game much look back first

likely appealing well overall roguelite progression system incredibly fulfilling always leaves wanting theres almost always something new unlock ways progress story even hundreds runs part upgrades interesting enjoyable rather cosmetic fluff difficulty seemed somewhat high first expect roguelike learning mechanics easy feel like god good way yet tons options crank difficulty customizable ways subsequently increase rewards making overall replayability pretty insane constantly keeping things challenging youre willing push biggest complaint system level difficulty known heat unlocked one increment time per weapon make game easyboring middle stages skillgear level surpasses maximum possible difficulty essentially drudge mindless grinding make game challenging finally game actually fun

expect great art music story hades absolutely delivers music fantastic courtesy darren korb art gorgeous characters endearingif werent fan combat past games im sure hades would different weapons remind certain weapons bastion boons powerups remind functions transistor combine roguelite elements get hades youre wary early access games id say depends tolerant early access hades solid somewhat unpolished roguelite sometimes game kind breaks loading stuff like first open game start run open settings fast often feel like rng like im trying get items upgrade upgrading hub area powers feel tediously grindy need lot upgrade enemies often throw projectiles keep moving theres often lot going screen personally im big supergiant games roguelite fan im lot fun playing hades love talking every character game want every character love never enough artifacts upgrades dont mind early access core gameplay narrative appeals try hades skip wait release agree critic reviews gamesomehow plays even better looks sounds im glad gave reviews tried game although trailer seemed bit hectic surprisingly well balanced game keeps giving hours hades completely enthralled well earned accolades tossed direction come tight fun combat stay story characters charm quite long time ive trying various roguelike games piqued interest though never ive actually able play one long timei feel like game many ones ive tried rich story character development progresses accumulate clearsi may bullshitting actually first roguelike ive ever able clear game genre held attention long enough beforeso even youre big fan roguelikes general id still recommend solid storythis game apparently even god mode progress story without worrying game difficult reason runs smoother steam placebo effect either way great game reason whenever see topdown game always get turned little bit since mainly play fps shootersrpgs funny thingwhat doesnt make sense every topdown game ive ever played absolutely love ie diablo binding isaac hotline miami enter gungeon etc course purchased hades scenario artwork game done incredibly well theres much tiny detail matter youre game awesome music thoughtful fitting well large cast godly characters brought life funny unique way makes every encounter interesting enjoyable combat fluid extremely easy learn said basic controls sure variety ways attack move around different areas map finally story starts quite simplistic runs kinda think got figured nope deeper make depths hell story unravels id give game second ive spent playing enjoyable would highly recommend game anyone interested buying past someone thats never really able get roguelikes lites dont know time ive title one enjoyable ive genre ive mildly begrudgingly experienced times past immaculate voiceover work breathtaking art direction incredibly engaging combat isnt game look youre like youve fan genre much past take chance one like im positive worth time someone fascinated greek mythology hades provides rather unexplored aspect greek mythology orphism however hades also truly addicting game posing challenge experienced players easy pick beginners one thing learned research playing controller much much easier keyboard mouse something much agree controller support game allows appreciated greatly provides aspect variability within player community big fan around easy learn hard master aspect
