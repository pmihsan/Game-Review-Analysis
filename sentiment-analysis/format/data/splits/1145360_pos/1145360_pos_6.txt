different ways play build character every escape attemptyou spend countless hours taking charming setting dialogue every charactertheres many thing unlock make every run easierharderor interesting altogethera great pick play game well long term game spend entire day runs customizing house hades perfect perfect pretty pog pretty addicting pretty addictive kinda gets old finish game times though pretty alright guess pretty awesome pretty cool pretty cool pretty damn good fun twist greek mythology surprised general authenticity main character zagreus isnt actually original character game feels fluid fun play though found generally using two three attacks could use main secondary cast often secondary felt unnecessary cumbersome use little damage also nitpick default pc controls map secondary attack q instead right mouse button makes actually fighting secondary bit awkward especially since cast uses charge need pick ground already inherently limited ability gets easier access mouse button control next main attack art work good emphasis character portraits use heavy shadowing music excellent usual darren korb supergiant games rock even speed metal feel story excellent voice acting generally pretty good although characters seem little terms acting im sure trust american devs adding mate script games repetition kept check enormous amounts dialog story content trickle fed player however still wish option use renovations offered change look dungeons rather house hades return death successful run however since levels arent actually randomly generated probably would add needless complexity developers terms difficulty game fairly forgiving rarely encountered instadeath areas though sometimes id lack enough damage make area effectively also sometimes encountered scenarios flying enemies would refuse go back land making hard hit melee weapons expect competant player expect able start clearing runs within attempts ie took attempts hit first cleared run game also feels like encourages spamming attacks little much much powerful dashstrikes becoming reliant limit progress harder difficulty levelsgraphics fan default scheme attacks feel like three attack options often superfluousfun bad roguelikemusic point deducted orpheus singing voice bit grating earshighly recommended anyone even slightest tolerance roguelikes pretty fire pretty fun guess pretty fun pretty fun

personajes solo utilizando su voz felicitaciones todas las voces de los dioses como todos los juegos de supergiant games la curva de dificultad es bastante rebuscada primero aparenta ser exponencial luego baja un poco comienza ser como todos los roguelike tiende ser repetitivo sin embargo el estudio sabe lidiar con la agregando un nivel de dificultad personalizado muy parecido al visto en transistor arma parece menos que otra prefiriendo utilizar mi arma favorita ir cosa que el juego trata de evitar el juego muy bien logrado tanto como transistor espero que el estudio siga haciendo las cosas bien para la say hours play like supergiants games marvel art magnificent music good great well achieved personality characters using acting voice congratulations voices gods like supergiants games difficulty curve quite elaborate first appears exponential goes bit begins logarithmic like roguelike tends repetitive however studio knows deal repetition thus adding custom difficulty level much like one seen transistor weapon seems less useful another preferring use favorite weapon take turns game tries avoid giving bonus game well done liked much transistor hope studio continues well
