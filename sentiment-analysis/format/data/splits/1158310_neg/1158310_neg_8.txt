surprisingly chaotic really fun even dont know youre surprisingly fun typically initial release tends somewhat empty comes paradox games great starting point thats enjoyable getgo im little disappointed lack ruler designer though also annoyed ui initially ive gotten used could still better opinion especially comes tooltips game constantly crashes reason many many graphical glitches bugs quite bit good things constnat crashing ruins fact reporting system paradox also crashes doesnt work tldr complex rich expected repetitive frustratingthis first crusader kings game enticed promise rich deep strategy game slow burn layers complexity always enjoyed total war games often ended autoresolving battles seemed like good fitthe game good wellpolished fun point ui implies much grasp understand get used everything realise menus popups offer little way choices quickly become repetitive intrigue options pointless hooks people rarely leads anything good murdering people difficult pointless marrying people form alliances necessary strategy frustrating marry daughter someone die soon rendering alliance null resetting back hard anything vassals without annoying becoming tyrant priest takes years convert religion one county thats total waste time vassals change mind religion anyway whim battles boring real input strategy end trying chase enemies around map defeat survive positive youre losing side frustrating thing succession even get head around complicated way titles passed game still screws creating titles dont exist split empire spent hours carefully building empire game took two thirds away autogenerating titles couldnt even afford make random events random halfdozen things get recycled end things become annoyances steward extramarital affair third time
