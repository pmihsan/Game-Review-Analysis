battle system need polished ai aggressiveness scaled bit literally warfare simulation always war neighbors rarely diplomacy side stuff make great im ready drop extra full game upcoming years im sure years great game feels inferior graphically vastly superior feels like tried hard modern wound making ui feel cluttered unappealing prefer minimalist character screen didnt take half screen bombardment notifications regret buying game alright pretty fun changes holds suck ass pain upgrade time feel worth money unless spam us dlc like holy hell bad im terrible realm flying apart constantly cant seem stop playing thats something im terrible game kingdoms typically last long suppose would actual medieval monarch style bizarre events atmosphere keep coming back despite lack

isles ivarr boneless years vassals replaced daughtersister died ive devoted player euiv years greatly looking forward latest instalment far disappointed graphics huge improvement previous instalments new gameplay really intriguing adds fun new depth challenge game however positive things say gamei expecting game bare bones compared predecessor paradox surely slowly sell full game us instalments next years however even base game suprisingly lacking onto ruler dynasty far previous character murdered plot gift poisoned coins whenever ive tried plotting murder anyone else plot surprise surprise box poisoned coins time would victim simply refused gift option never given fact single plot ive embarked came even close succeeding even character high intrigue devoted expert spymaster intrigue focus attempts murder lowborn nobody intrigue foiled every turn surely bug game family bombarded successful plots realm even vassals dislike yet plots fail miserably next minimap rather lack one seriously paradox decide longer necessary map huge one wrong click character fly side world minimap click get tedious pretty fast entire ui fairly unwieldy gone neat goodlooking simple dialog boxes mini menus instead massive dark sliding windows take half screen popups block buttons pop ups windows seem impossible dismiss ive gone dismiss pop find anywhere click dismiss event creates pop ups times pop take screen without pausing game time youve finally managed dismiss armies attacked destroyed whilst blinded vital news cousin married obscure count miles away affair game full useful tooltips range one two helpful lines full paragraphs information holdings people many tooltips actually rare isnt one screen somewhere becomes incredibly irritating pretty fast whenever pop dialog appears struggle read matter mouse placed tooltip appears blocks message need read even mouse far dialog window pop ups seem appear inconvenient position option shrink hide tooltips one needs adding fast maybe patch adds minimapcourt physicians return previous games however seems theyve forgotten tools absolutely nothing character fell ill poisoned coin plot mentioned earlier option seek treatment intervention well paid dr king died weeks later characters injured fall ill constantly game tells expects react news never way actually help poor buggers court physician role seems purely diagnosing people drop dead one irritating bug ive experienced dozen times already involves attempting imprison vassals vassal committed crime realm game constantly told imprison allowing freedom places character risk however attempt arrest fails triggers war rebellion war instantly ends inconclusively unspecified reasons criminal remains free putting back square one way around bug game keeps advising impossible arrest powerless stop plotting criminal running havoc overall game feels half finished beta release ingredients another paradox epic take away days free time yet turned decent game cannot emphasise enough players thinking forking game bother wait year tonne patches updates dlc released game sale maybe itll worth money hoi iv buggy mess seemed half thought poorly executed broken

got sent home couldnt stop playing hours game obviously keeps concept goals set dynasty really similar ckii immersion another level yes removed merchant republics game almost content ckiis expansions better mechanics example played russian pagan raiding system much fun beginningdont hesitant buy damn game trust wont able stop playing practice alttab dont lose job iberia mess would play id youre

destroy christians secret pagan heres chance bathe blood rejoice total war battles idk would need another game arent plotting kill someone time arent trying didnt play new sort grand strategy games definitely good starting point get extremely userfriendly game great tutorial although havent bothered game easy get doesnt steep learning curve overall experience really fun game good dont get wrong price dont think worth biggest problem combat ai experience noticeably crusades every crusade ive far always ended way christians get absolutely obliterated yes arent meant easy reason never succeed ai sieges holding gets onto boat moves another rinse repeat bankrupt never seem take battles try retreat usually leaving parts army behind slowly get destroyed one one couldnt make boats time rest army ive probably played around hours ish xbox store im struggling get grips game quite easily take count emperor unfortunately also mostly bad overlooked problems game enjoy game lot full price game even missing simple attach army button would solve lot issues arent primary participant war youre war leader allies typically stick like glue go battle probably bad likelihood success still follow battle trusting judgement thats good ally secondary participant wars lose fun embark disembark issue wasnt really thing ever noticed hours game say wars seemed lot polished game fix army ai game enjoyable dont let sons fight knights got balls enjoyed crusader kings getting game nobrainer graphical improvement also carries many good features originally dlcin addition paradox made game much userfriendly got lost confused interface randomnessthe thing missing game time review glitterhoof ever decided goal life juggle explosive plates someone threw burning cats game highly recommend

balance power vassals example single lowly vassal single county decide military twice powerful even though youve purposefully building run whole kingdom go rampage without permission causing everyone hes upsetting declare war hes vassal responsibility vassal swayed fails married refuses otherwise influenced improve relations plummeted well hes git reason find started went daily tried revoke powers took kingdom tried grant territory improve relations took remained asking stop war rebelled took kingdom tried murder failed twice rebelled took kingdom also easy setting reign first character early yes started vassal repeated attempts reloading saves deal vassal got nowhere restart solution basically wasted hours nowin situationalso early game get used idea hard work instantly undone die territory divided children sometimes random uncle unknown reasons youll left perhaps couple titles king duchy county two split remotely even dont think two children means youll continue half territory suggestion protect firstborn two like kingdom relies slam wedding tackle draw repeatedly ensure landgrabbing little scamps arrive destroy next leaders realm seriously stressful actual job would buy

change updates compared game like hours still achievements unearned overall amount goals limited game ends becoming map painting game lasts get bored number people family makes game slow playdespite

influence develop also easier understand plan imo also every character attribute much influences many decisions ingame besides gameplay much like second part course make marriages alliances rise world die gout someone murders accident things bit annoying far bad overview map level especially warfare often dont even see armies anymore map view changed reason warfare also got bit improved specialised troop types add normal leviesthe overview part biggest problem since news snippets plop go away seen much options changing reading older ones also windows close automatically click news makes open againotherwise regarding bugs game seems mostly stable working order especially fresh stage releasethe music still much improved comparison ckii annoying least conclusio looking forward many centuries crusading honestly liked second part get even complicated risk glance since opinion got quite bit easier understand transparentscore edit sadly multiplayer still quite bugged main game makes take one point away current state game theres many glitches game borderline lies youheres example lie king want give son duchy give de jure counties together duchy menu vassal repeated times complete action independent duchy combat major flaw give son counties first initial transfer afterwards counties give duchy hes vassal literally thing delayed duchy title tiny amount youre likely paused anyway tick daytheres registered lies screwed timethe map mode also lackluster features hidden away stupid ways rather convenient buttonexample want see direct vassal control desmene go full realm political map right click correct vassal capitals randomly wont work chance either showing half complete direct vassal map full version another example map mode youre giving characters land map neutralizes realm view longer access direct view de jure making either screenshot prior refer picture memorize make sure dont screw upthe menus ui clearly show bulkiness bloat rather convenient theres option change accordingly theres often literally cover screen due menu bloat play im unhappy even diving qol features removed shouldve begin also future dlc ill check game later actually patch fix stuff first hours
