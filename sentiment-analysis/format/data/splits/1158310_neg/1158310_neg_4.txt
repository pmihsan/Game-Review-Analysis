initially negative review mostly based fact user interface felt worse original ckii continuing play game mod changed drastically views strongly recommend game modding way easier ckii game play similar improved flows naturally strongly recommend defeated holy roman empire within first five years rule simply army attempted siege capital flanked army apparently emperor front line begging captured greatest game ever made absolutely nothing one playthroughs conquered europe without single fight everything make perfect heir nearcomplete irish kingdom idiot died random battle didnt even really care everything left incompetent emergency backup son awful would recommend history degree open mind comes fratricide didnt dislike anything game didnt really play one predecessors cant make big comparisons newcomer series lot right dont immediately feel lost many tool tips explanations game world feels dynamic lively decisions well thought many complain lost depth probably expanded future dlc patches newcomers series fans etc clear purchase recommendation discovered soulmate pope saved attempted murder children child beneficiary holy war became queen jeruselum except lesbian still kids husband proud converted islam avoid uprising several popes killed fun waged wars bad dying boar hunting accident age first blind trial playthrough fantastic game recommend game issuesfirst developer behind seduction part game cuckold festish wants everybody know itsecond able intervene liberty wars going vassals claims going inbetween vassals horrible game mechanici usually use debugger imprison everybody stop war force release claims move onalso able call individual groups menatarms levies really hinders gameplay years inlove game alot offers first time player jesus issues bad makes wonder devs even play game dont believe game even made company really paradox actually learn past mistakes make better game world live go buy amazin dont even hours yet took less realize mess imperator worthy successor one greatest games time obviously isnt fully featured predecessor dlc made years theres enough included get old quickly especially everything thats new lot missing featuresmechanics werent great first place ui left stranded times ive never lost ui paradox game first hours ill least give pass may update ive spent time really enjoyed previous title wont disappointed one dont even know wtf damn fun dont much time put yet already tell gonna suck soul hundreds hours suck wallet hundreds dollars dlc eventually im happy ultimately test game like final cost equal dollar per hour played less tell gonna blow past probably pennies per hour playedstarted india began spreading mahayana buddhism headed rome eventually would set militant buddhist road rome theromanroadisadharmicpath dont much time play games saw game somehow requires learned reluctant also nowadays games dont surprise llet tell game blown away years since hooked game wiling spend time tutorial mess around tutorial hours occasionally google doubts try itthe game keeps wanting know happens faced decisions make consider many factors adapt decisions character goals many variables game clear purpose least decide purpose give beauty game lies give purpose want warned along way many things happen pursue purpose dont know im cracking kill siblings dont know im wife cheated dont know fuck going still love dont normally play games like get boring repetitive predictable end unsatisfying ever since started hours played consecutive never played new series absolutely hooked short many different ways play game make head spin seem bit overwhelming first stuck decided pick route espionage overthrowing kingdoms alliances shadows many died battle help hinder liege kidnapped wives heirs kings randsom sending back tortured dont think game really definitely wouldnt recommend say stellaris played almost hours friends already feel burnt im someone play stellaris weeks end think biggest letdown rng lack reward hard efforts often every two hours would see progress wiped sudden death current ruler inheritance splitting realm frequently would vassals rebel new rulers weakened thanks distributed lands quite often first thing would successfully acquiring dutchy kingdom fight ancestor dies throws wind whats worse game feels completely arbitrary matters wifes military strength narrowly claim danelaw equal foe result wife fight constant wars preserve territory somehow military capabilities fifth previously danelaw seriously levies go theres ruler deaths alliances happen time capable keeping vast network peoples faces make games world im inevitably disadvantagebut worst part got crusades fucking crusades man every time would push danelaw catholic church would call entirety europe take back counties id crusade declared new ruler previously ruled territory king ireland hell point catholicism threat maybe danelaw verge collapse take holy site id understand crusade single nudge territory happened six separate times im pretty sure every crusade occurred game specifically arent fuckers supposed going muslims another thing dont crusades implode like always ive read one crusade accomplished goals without something going awry point game punishes trying accomplish anything dont expect game hold hand roflstomp planet would appreciate could rewarded efforts ive already turned savescumming try reach level success eras end doesnt tell upset point dont know dont understand online guides either assume ive suffered recent head injury played crusader kings ii highest difficulty cant suss exactly im wrong interface really excited show things like people ive never met winning wars miles away instead keep losing battles kids keep dyingthe game also complicated seemingly sake complicated layer layers politics boundary disputes poorly explained concepts make initial learning curve learning mountain dont get im trying hard figure exactly game wants mei want like game dont necessarily enjoy accessibility supposedly added predecessor still cant figure basic concepts like combat line succession life game seems think already know im constantly finding new menus tweak minute details kingdom duchy barony whatever thing cant quite differentiate click button everyone planet suddenly deciding crucified made pope angry something eventually figure exactly game wants ill delete review beyond frustrated complete lack clear information core concepts dont understand game rated highly game plays time dont know hell going forget crap dont want unfortunate accident fall upon dont know play game complexity play first game wreck learning get point know play time start start real game im ati centered life around video games since mario brothers best strategy game ever

especially common character king emperor thousands interactive characters game real set way play focus making religion culture cover world focus heir gaining control play world peace historical jerk raid people time play historical mode game balanced random mode hybrid variety settingsif patience think strategies deep enough need game game also taught alot history heritage hours played ancestors tied royalty nothing gratifying playing even try rise peasant emperor equally gratifying dont know recomend game breeding best children dynasty murdering enemy dynasty babies dont really understand wage war effectively efficiently manage realm however understand murder enemies children seduce wives dont know guys think paradox mayve rocked mean like boxer clipping dudes chin small stuff keeps

bought hell thingin good way wwii medieval time baby expected got tired game real fast cant tell whats problem compared game feels hollow certainly improvements game doesnt feel right depending play game getting primogeniture succession isnt really fun since usually start games since game ends game without primogeniture isnt suited certainly really easy fix since default succession equality gets countered disinherinting sons one guy inherits everything certainly challenging difficulty lacking one major exploits game lot counties penalties extra counties stop therefore counties could singlehandedly conquer entire world hit empire rank feel like needs change prevent since moment become emperor create alliance counter revolts game becomes easy lot cool new mechanics sequel game missing juice maybe expansion provide something interesting also early crusades pope uselessparticipating deathwish start lowly count converting people religion annoying early midgame difficult late game impossibly easy farted banquet held honour sitting next daughter law seduced made lover told passed gas opinion improved holding illegitimate son real sons half brother farting simulator year

worn im changing negative one magic boats ruined ai every faction access magic boats cost almost nothing meaning everybody map sail wherever want every war looks like dday landlocked cultures knowledge experience sea travel conquer coastal county literally launch dday scale invasion another continent day later ai seems care expansion theyll conquer single counties another continent theyll begin conquering silly direction one county example uncommon see france byzantium conquering line african desert real life conquest another continent required huge navy incredible amount money trivial raise army sail magic boats take single county never suffer problems county surrounded hostile cultures religions uncommon see byzantium conquering north finland simply troop numbers factions area weaker cant fight backbalance horrendous vikings conquer world start date blobs never stop blobs get bigger blobbier county control mechanism insignificant doesnt stop rapid expansion one bitfeels like map painter theres nothing interesting youre war gave vassal land gave son son killed started civil war genuinely cannot stop playing game get lost rivalries generational feuds get king shit go

years later found brother wife lovers child together well virtually everyone extended family assassinated including brother wives almost ireland damn king died everything split naturally bloodlust took slaughtered brothers take back rightfully mine high expectations im disappointed game massive upgrade terms user interface usability content feature set far feel really strong anticipate dumping hundreds hours game next months never played ck series decided pick ckiii describe think game would years reading medieval novels seeing series damsel gets married swine husband land always intrigued horrified practice medieval times brutes played hours marrying children princes princesses without regard whatsoever opinion discontent would either disregard disown kill ckiii made century liberal become one ruthless medieval monarchs lot games brilliant game innovative gameplay never read another historical novel way hate election hate new version update hate say cant really recommend stands although bad imperator release theres lot desired release still free theres much reason move yetfirst things like gameplay general pretty solid undoubtedly improved timethe art music great alwaysthe army battle system feels depth allows certain degree customization beyond spamming op retinue allows pick limited number men arms units counter certain others used enhance basic levy units also get pick select courtiers vassals become knights fight alongside men provide large boosts damage depending prowessthe new dynasty system makes playthroughs seem unique family seem alive getting see many branching cadet lines giving incentive give titles familythe lifestyle system gives lot customization provides lot good bonuses characterthere limited number build slots cant buy every single building actually plan want county developtheres lot wrong thoughthere fraction mapmodes particularly annoying vassal mapmode merged realm mapmode switching depending level zoomyou longer play republicthe characters look bit samey severe lack clothing optionsmustering rally points replaced calling vassal levies meaning get entire army single spot matter daysthe ai terrible helping battles isnt helped fact theres longer attach army button manually follow allies army allies also prefer stand single county away instead actually help battle forces would tip scalesborder gore taken whole new levels maybe particular playthrough seems like far flung kingdoms expanding place example gardariki barely expanded russia control lots holland france ireland seems many fractured kingdoms random patches land placethere plenty bugs succession seems messy minute random people taking land countries succession law making difference sometimes seducing romancing wife treated like seduction leading weird events host feast see wife get hit random vassalsfor ui also downgrade theyve gone minimalist feel seems far useful tabs arranged side screen outliner pops front leaving large gap looking messy players use time honestly get feeling cheap mobile game look itone saddest missing features lack artifacts longer craft personal sword set armour write books overall really bad game meh definitely
