spectacular story though story left emotionally broken ready ending beat one go im fucking speechlessthat said problems moment game writing review really bad really common audio bug boss fights especially events every time absorb spirit tree rape ears seem like crash ive crash nearly hours dumped single day enough recommend game ori wisps sequal ori blind forest lot added game world bigger populated various npcs talk lore quests abilities theres also lot focus combat rather getting upgrades create custom builds structure quite different previous game game feels like cross ori hollow knight games platforming much easier blind forest pro con depending preference died times getting blind forest comparison died times getting wisps great game game precision key survival precise control visual clarity constant theme brings overall experience otherwise amazing beautiful atmosphere amazing graphics music clever level design makes blast play explore world platforming epic challenging first game still fun compared first game lot less trialanderrordeaths prevented already know danger advance world bigger much optional speed trials epic chase scenes theyre fun upgrades fun usecons combat oriented moves enemies even boss fights unfortunately alone equal better combat still shallow uninteresting mess expect eat lot random damage due poor design lack precision lack clarityyou grapple attack enemy enemy randomly hits anyways getting hit grapple enemy smash bounces wall touches damaging youre recovering smash animation try attack enemy attacks enemy recovers fast rarely safely attack try bash enemy ori grapples nearby location instead touches enemy way eat damage want dodge attack cant see attacks resulting damage boss fights particular visually confusing messfor veterans combat oriented games none bosses give kind challenge save chase sequences almost bosses easily beaten first try many combat trials also beaten first try save one two playing hard mode somewhat alleviate lack challenge unfortunately hard mode also magnifies flaws games combat system mentioned previously abilities upgrades expensive hard mode expensive makes playing hard mode feel like drag grind even players find normal mode easy alone seriously discourage playing hard mode although rare poorly placed checkpoints annoying boss fights many boss fights alternate combat chase sequences generally clear game transitioned chase sequence cause deaths die chase scene may redo parts combat retrying chase scene various abilities fun use theyre clunky use lack precision grapple uses button bash resulting player constantly performing wrong action grapple burrow difficult aim control resulting missed jumps deaths ori wisps inferior original every way focuses solely combat grindy upgradeshopping mechanics made ori killer skip go play original ori wisps many things side scroller mythical fantasy metroidvania really makes game stand platforming one start getting feel environment skills unlock game really starts point enemies enemies part platforming environment definitely recommend ori blind forest already blew mind game even better ori blind forest good one better ori blind forest steroids ori blind forest really good indie game best indie game ever played game ori wisps everything blind forest better instead button mash style content spam one button avoiding enemies hurt em light beams game gives straight front forward combat mean actually move around enemy slamming sword bow hammer ever kill mention full bosses game compared blind forest
