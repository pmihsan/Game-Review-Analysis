quickly ill change review positiveotherwise id avoid unfortunately damm cried first cut scenejust ori awesomeness buy game even half soul damm hard close tthe game ur playtrough das spiel ist einer der besten die ich meinen leben gespielt habe definitely ori blind forest phenomenal game fun since story made cry damn good definitely improvement blind forest little bit worried platforming would take hit new focus combat system platforming fluid first game combat system exactly hollow knight least terms difficulty find fun also havent seen lot bugs glitches reviewers currently mentioning least nothing seriously detracts quality game atmosphere wise theres lot npcs game world feels much lived first rather lonely atmosphere comparisonmy primary gripes chase escape sequences rather short comparison first game escape kuro ginso tree oris combat abilities interesting enemies could use variation opinion perhaps mini bosses heavy type enemies like gorleks despite possible bugs may run even frustration parts incredible game movement feels fluid crazy things done boss fights interesting mechanics especially final boss done easily devs end oris story natural way instead storytelling failure even need explain works directly forum instead letting players feel gameplay enjoy first installment game enjoy map exploration segmented areas blocked abilities well whole lot plus terribly annoying one mistake die sections like first game map starts flood overall well aint broke dont fix right theory another game enjoyable ride didnt disappoint didnt think would possible improve upon perfection first game actually damn itamazing dont fooled play time already completed times xbox purchased support moon studios would pay even comes shitty epic store dont bother adjust final challenge difficulty spike wall pixel perfect zero margin error generally awful experience balanced ruins otherwise excellent gameif dont believe google ori worm chase horrible dont buy game dont ssd many audio issues bad performance running hdd totally gamer killer last thing want fps freezes dont buy game hate cryingspoiler like first ori break heart pieces dont miss game dont think lot dont hesitate buybuy game waiting dope ass game hope keep making games cuz much fun update game becomes less less playable currently players audio company refuses give refunds buy game easily one best metroidvanias ive ever played right hollow knight rough part game first boss hide corner wait get close hit twice repeat process boring really bad way introduce boss fights player bad part game though rest game fantastic edit since people keep saying im bad game made make clear first recommend game youd expect sequel beautiful graphics characters easily worth pricebut point ive mind since playing first game tiny flaws game grinds gearsunfortunately game inherited biggest weaknesses original game first minor annoyances control due complex geometryfor example climb wall little ramp makes character fall said wall extra annoying falling wall counts using jump cannot double jump like youd expect sometimes little bump wall make dash abruptly without warning maybe spikes enemies sometimes climb ledge onto flat ground character pops air bit instead dropping onto ground screw counts using jumpanother minor annoyance enemies attacks really designed outplayed skillful controls theyre predictable often feels like button mashing attacks superior dps better trying avoid enemy attacks projectiles targeted adjust aim consecutive shot lets say theres spider shoots three consecutive bursts spider shoots ground im standing dodge first shot jumping jump according timing next shot spider aimed midair first jump second shot comes air instead ground hitting another example crawling bug shoots three spikes almost impossible consistently dodge pointblank covers every angle approach idea one three going targeted either best strategy kill enough clicks attack youthird one enemies hit touching even theyre stunned cannot dash enemies either makes unable play aggresively dash past enemy get behind dash get enemies face land finisher einfach nur fantastisch ich war begeistert vom ersten teil ich bin begeistert vom zweiten man kann sich streiten welcher nun besser ist aber das ist einfach nur spielt beide mich die besten games die es nur gibt epic games beautiful visuals great controls tight fun fast paced platforming interesting combat many combat options fans hollow knght liek game great music nice story would buy es un juego hermoso en todo aspecto desde lo visual hasta la banda sonora jugabilidad gran progreso en al anterior ori blind forest even better first game first game damn fantastic even though bit short absolutely amazing definitely goty contender ever since bought game
