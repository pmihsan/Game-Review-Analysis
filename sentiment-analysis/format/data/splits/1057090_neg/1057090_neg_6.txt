movement kit ori useless came forin dark part place without light die within second relies glowing bud guide map however bug spawn fixed spot go fixed route within fixed period dont follow close enough die try go alternate path cant looking fun wont stupidest design choice ever seen instead showcasing fluid movement restrict point room error instead encouraging explore world tells follow paththanks hate game dont buy game right swear god ill beat scrawny bony badtastehaving ass god enjoyed ori blind forest must moon studios deployed bit everything one difficult boss battles side quests enjoyed first one one plus play missed first one would suggest playing first one itll make sense enjoyed original game one disappoint detailed environments larger map greatly expanded combat system added retaining challenging platforming made blind forest much fun apart one two times got stuck inside walls encounter gamebreaking issues bugs played game wasting life seriously see point live played game good like metroidvanias crying like little bitch literally reason get game good hollow knight liked ori blind forest must buy like way progression redesigned doesnt feel like starting scratch level ie get dash bash early shit ton new combat movement abilities mechanics id say combat mechanics become fleshed spamming bash ground slam delete enemies level puzzle design far outstanding theres gigantic room rotate upside order get side graphics still fantastic scenery vibrant id also say new soundtrack significantly better first gamesadmittedly game isnt perfect really strange bugs fps stutters every often reason parts cutscenes proper msaa aa ive noticed several times ori ku really jagged edges compared everything else fact grapple bash bound thing default unchangeable controller leads lot accidental deaths damage taken game thinks want grapple something instead bashing projectile vice versa spirit shard enabling grapple enemies also sometimes allows bash grappling liked first one powers friends zonesgreat music great story difficult platformingthere however negtives spoil abilitys get herethe fact grapple bash well burrow dash button respectively causes unexpected behavior sometimes gone crisp platforming blind forest want bash enemy bad game thinks want grapple shoots skythis even worse dash burrow button often time leaves sitting wall wanted burrow especialy bad one later bosses die repeadedly thismore abilitys fun many different movement options bound button causes frustrationsalso weird bug sounds one boss werent playing quick restart fixed however liked first one totally get second one didnt even take minutes story suck bring right back sense completely enthralled made love first onethe music good environment even beautiful still

heart race ori fought life felt joys watching flip air concern made noise always makes getting hit game filled much love character design music art style dare feel something bounce flip slash way goal buy already okay give microsoft reason greenlight third one fucking hard cannot change difficulty mid game difficulty extremely uneven boss battles close impossible rest gameplay fine wont know actually needed pick easy late already invested much time save gamewhy fuck cant change difficulty mid game lot still pretty better combat somewhat worse traversalmechanics story naively simple told exactly flawed way would play hadnt art style music story also platforming combat smooth ori skills acrobat around nothing complain except turn graphics alot thats bc laptop really fun long unless plan playing multiple times bugs never gamebreaking sometimes visual stuff glitched wall never problem sad ive never left steam review feel need leave one played ori blind forest first game series found enjoyable nothing lackluster ways specifically combat exploration ori wisps fixes issues really realization first game could combat gives options fight enemies plethora different ways im sure every positive review mentioned art music phenomenal final dungeon boss blew away javais de retrouver lambiance toute qui avait mise en place dans le premier volet ori blind forest une que la recette ait un gout de mais non rien de tout se retrouve nouveau dans un univers magnifique jai vraiment vu peu de direction artistique aussi magique de toujours un gameplay au poil avec des qui et se au fur et mesure cest vraiment un exemple de game et level design extremement bien un haut de chapeau pour moon studio qui propose une vraiment fantastique je conseille tout le monde de tenter vous ne serez pas un sans faut pour moi jesus christ step previous game perfection con microtransactions need throw money minutes game already hooked upedit finished game hard difficulty im telling dont torture specially areas worthy finish hard difficulty escape cost like hours game play time im serious dont torture hard play normal amazing original visuals gameplay hold standard music even better reason ditched mechanics first game favour ripping hollow knight dumb one last metroidvania series needs steal ideas good also felt story hit lot beats original minor stuff compared game gets right play first game play gorgeous touching godawful frustrating first one buy cry crying game save sister buy regret buy wont regret finished missions miss game already frustrating wasting another moment game go ahead play games wont regret great bit trouble many gifts play would pay well play itits amazing though im little frustrated save glitched stuck forever ninjas cutting onions keep mind looove ori blind forest im writing heavy heart looking forward game im disappointed continuation literally second ori game game structure objectives progressing story though improvements fight mechanics control movement makes enjoyable run around locations even beautiful first game soundtrack sublime like story one bit actually left heartbroken miserable days dont mean compliment elaborated emotional plot bittersweat ending unnecessarily cruel ruthless destroying every good message first game tried convey let start saying love game grievance lies ability grapple certain points map well using button reflect enemy attack thus push away combat severely frustrating ori decides wants grapple instead reflect causing character receive damage often like original prettier combat mechanics like preivous one game destroyed feelings way finish stroy ps exprinced bugs glitches game let slide game damn perfect recommend game heart likes plotline graphics music game physicsmechanics expansive map sidequestsdislikes puzzles lean exploiting game mechanics heavily ended going youtube stuff didnt want waste lot time figuring literally best game evah best hrs shit ass life far thank literally beginawesome soundtrackawesome visualsawesome atmosphereyou needa play game period mega hard game either looks music aside play like first ori game im sitting good im constant input delay movement feels clunky combat feels clunky even backdrop art points seems struggle rest game going around feels like took weapons dead cells built world similar hollow knight really wanted game sadly cannot recommend others unless open spamming attacks sprite filled confetti go ahead lost four hours gameplay seemingly reason afraid boot game repeat scenario shame game fantastic love game waiting since forever finished stuck finding another game grr loved first one disappointed sequel loved game gave attempting attempt sand worm sadly ill never know ending enjoyed much point ill still give thumbs moon studios developers please read played ori blind forest majority ori wisps keyboard mouse absolutely issues one best experiences game ive ever haduntil worm chase scene spoilers controls dont work half time pressed correct buttons make ori try climb sand instead burrow tried remap dash burrow skills left mouse button checkpoints zero single one single mistake make restart chase scene two hours every attempt takes minute attempted times already left pinky finger wants die press ctrl dash oftensolutions possible spoilers add one checkpoint get past pit spikes around halfway isnt spoiler either since dear players retrying part game least remove rubberbanding effect worm get far far away worm comes right back worst times worst meaning places ori refuses burrow instead make burrowing like bash based mouse positionside note spending money xbox controller beat one threeminute chase segment one game play everything else fine keyboard mousei know possible beat beat really downgraded
