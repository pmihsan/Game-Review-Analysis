story would definitely recommend audio simply work change audio nvidia based driver works never works im using device uses realtek audio makes simply unplayable god fucking damnit fix please authors game create natural magic matter minutes manage imbue relationship betweencharacters believe real friends one gets impression familiar bizarre creatures ages least many years experiences quickly flow ownand even games antagonist giant creek bird evokes sympathy terrible cruel creature must say however story behind atrocities simple less heartbreaking compare shriek kuro previous part unlike dark owl bird take path redemption turns away light light turned away heart remains enveloped darknessalas plot presented small rather rare portions sometimes several hours gameplay pass cutscenes even get lost think story turned coherent wish characters like scream screen time addition level staging cut scenes highest bulk narrative tied visualauthors prefer tell story environments small details scene scream hides pouring rain petrified wings dead parents enough dramatic elaborate moments gamethis game advise everyone play authors great respect creating masterpiece played controller boss fights game best boss fights game ever game shining example boss fights done game bosses never spongy difficult mechanics could figure stay alive game rivals one boss fights dark souls plus story amazing im year old male cried like baby playing first one years ago finishing one good ass game boss roster pretty small doesnt matter real battle fighting back tears youll playing definition masterpiece beating immediately started finished another playthrough game amazing almost everything improvement last game however given state game right cant recommend many bugs completely ruin immersion main one

incredible tragicomic journey little ori dark dark world full glitches gamebreaking bugs awful performances visually stunning technically disastrousde facto still beta version amused worst games ones almost good wanted finish ori reviewing frustrating think gave last chase probably obnoxious thing ever suffer game contextsensitive controls work time last segment requires worst contextsensitive trick whole game says lot even stupid pride keep playing till end notes took playtime things suck ori character flashy blends background bright combat animations cant see disorienting sometimes mob attacks displace make lose track character hit stun animation lock attacks bad combat get hitstunned though also enemies auto aim dodge right enemy starts animation still autocorrect position animation finishes position mobs attack animation started thats cheap frustrating blind jumpsfalls ridiculously frustrating novision sections hard tell whats decorationbackground interacted eg ropes model doesnt line interact sometimes able grab even though touched often jump straight trying get onto platform although holding right left background sometimes blocks vision character completely countless deaths due context sensitive controls working worst part game far spirit shards meaningless fighting bosses mandatory gems socket take slots ie sticky triple jump magnet auto save system confusing disoriented respawning sure items get saved recollect old saving system ori great menus mess playing still keep hitting wrong buttons trying cancel trying change upgrade etc checking map
