pacing great combat felt fluid moves added becomes extremely satisfying masterthe story game great despite little dialogue explanation found quite sad conflicted end ending satisfyingthe art style game topnotchi appreciated game provided way obtain items fairly simply spent lot time tracking secrets couldnt get could come back later using screenshots ultimately proved unnecessary though let power greatly much earlier oni quite frustrated though often game crashed lot research seemed many issues closer launch cant understand almost year later game many issues sometimes play hours problem sometimes ill get three crashes ten minutes odd reason progressed game experienced less crashes point nonethere also minor graphical glitches ori standing specific places vibrate happens sometimes cutscenes fairly distractingeven frustrating crashes game worth game awasome really recomend tis game anyone play blind forest believe failures game dosent matter game suck really fall love story characters especially ending game damn near flawless every motion perform feels amazing every chase scene every boss fight wonderfully crafted visuals music narrative even everything comes together make awesome game one stay long time game easily goty one complaint direction story went fact main antagonist giant evil bird story still good game full emotions visuals outstanding even cried first minutes story line highly recommended game good still prefer ori blind forest game great far weird audio glitches got really bad soon entered wellspring fix game hard beautifulworld size variety also excellent cant say enemy varietycontrols tight issuessound get messy break occasionallyi still enjoyed immensely though game action platformer game far since ori blind forest game obviously beautiful strong aesthetics game play good strong dislike singular aspect otherwise beautiful game storythe amount backtracking plain tiresome lost count number times backtrack whoever level design moon studios needs take lesson ux frustrating travel way one area platformer go back finish another quest first point side quests cant even access even worse multiple areas finally clear hours exploring get water mill running secondary blockage preventing exploring aforementioned areas leading even backtracking another example spent gorlek ores early clear path cave find cant explore without light design game frustrating possible refuse reward players worked hard find work even give option explore want instead dead end blocked paths immersion gets killed forced stare map time instead exploring recommend game game phenomenal last years mostly fastpaced multiplayer games ori wisps first episode blind forest kept hooked whole campaign graphics artwork music gameplay sublime regret getting game game shit gameplay wise unless like dark souls shit bosses dont follow patterns dont signal attacks singal two different attacks way attacks cant dodge cant deal dmg without taking dmg bcz hitbox larger boss cant lower difficulty cant exit game without loosing progress boss platformer agility challenge game beautiful gameplay fun used shit platformers im addicted game beautiful everything perfect cried
