ninjas sneaking house cutting onions everything game screams immense polisheven first ori game big featbasically youve gotta play excellent game emphasis combat movement complexity ori blind forestthe game quite bit longer well completionistssimilarly previous game art music story magnificent excellent game built basis wellknown predecessor ori blind forestoris mobility insane title movement environments smooth art music excellent expectedthe weakness previous title combats gone various weapons choose enjoyable way true delight playmy complain ori small times making difficult see screenone advice go buy play ori first didnt already excellent game completed thoroughly hours game play visuals soundtrack great simple story lot heart technical problems stuttering major audio problems final area needed restart game solve however minor compared enjoyment got game excellent sequel original game much indepth combat options equally emotional story excellent story gameplay cant miss exceptional followup first game added new elements without making feel like missed part original tough moved game slowly still wish playtime dont know lack content enjoyable id gladly play expansion continuation franchise extremely bad play design point unplayable realised late cannot get refund nowedit believe search ori wisps escape giant sand worm youtube passed dev testing astounding extremely beautiful levels designed consistently interesting mechanic ever overstays welcome emotional moments well gameplayheavy game extremely touching end sad see ori gone lives fantastic visualsbest soundtrackemotional rollercoasteri cried lot fantastic game part incredible presentationonly cons felt fighting enemies little hard follow much going screen boss battle really liked last one fantastic game finished normal mode finished second time hard mode play sure must platform game enthusiast fantastic game fixed minor gripes first game traditional boss fights lack melee combat thing really complain game achievements full energy one dont seem registering complete overall game amazing first time side scrolling game really wowd graphics years wish longer like hollow knight hopefully get cool dlc near future fantastic sequel blind forest game play feels great game world large art stunning fast paced fluid occasionally frustrating platforming game gorgeous styling sound fast fluid utterly engaging general traversal however could also said original game wotw add keep things freshthe answer combat first seems like great idea practice proves little variety standard enemy types see another big dude club skin overall difficulty balance feels like complete mess overly difficult terms game encourages play checkpoint system original removed replaced withnothing means throw fights platforming reckless abandon need thought strategy damn shame early hours looked promising introduction involved melee approach combat essentially biggest overarching gripe entire game incredibly difficult get invested upgrade paths systems punished slightest incredibly lazy play point might wondering ticked recommend box despite overarching complaints still arent enough ruin well sour movement still feels sublime particular insanely detailed animations interacting objects swinging sword add gorgeous layer polish backgrounds art general stunning actual level design still competent throughout handful decent bosses still get overshadowed much effective escape sequences return first game overall game isnt total disappointment success innovations undermined heavily questionable design choices regarding checkpoints upgrades mostly rides triumphs original certainly far poor game would least come tempered expectations feeling empty finished game feels familiar enough first game adding new ideas never feels boring exploration always feels good bit confused ending ride along way good gets platformer games days hit feelz like ori nothing bad say game finished game hard mode god damn battle frustration tearsa worthy successor ori blind forest plus additions stolen lets say hollow knightat point days release quite lot bugs sounds gradually played fewer fewer points leave actual play areathe biggest problem game controls dont wanna spoil anything later game sequence another run boss died many times ori simply didnt dash direction telling controller go nonetheless pricevalue ratiohighly recommended first game perfect played times loved every single time one completely screwed terms key bindings key mechanics windows many new functions limited keys assign pressing q cant assign specials key want problem half time keys respond action high end keyboard thats issue games took example times yes try pass spider fight blue flower would circle around time use grapple despite close guess times work exact spot died burrow stupidly fast movements seem balanced toooooo fast many bad decisions went game overall disappointed recommend original already edit arrived worm part thats enough game uninstalled first foremost important state ori wisps good game right yet dont recommend anyone played ori blind forest found poor sequel every regardtldrrant rant game feels like hollow knight dressed ori ok game good sequel either regards mechanics storyatmosphere aesthetics lets face defining components ori games personally admit buying first game came across ost listening music youtube got hooked pure awesomeness music game purchased reason nierautomata regret decisionsand jump problems music ori wisps jus wasnt appealing great ambient music lacked impact first game felt generic even recycled melodies previous installment felt meh graphics similar feeling old designs carried looked great new enemies example felt years since played first game cant tell exactly new models fit handdrawn visual style environmentbut whats worse many graphic designs felt like things changed sake changing cant say better mean point changing light soultree blue yellow sure looks awful like really awful last one npcs include effect gameplay less atmosphere first game mostly sein talking rare interactions dead spirits absolute minimal number alive npcs critical story completely overturned random interactable npcs litter whole forest niwen player never really feals struggle alone narrative splintered interactions often absolutely pointless inclusion sidequests make even worse especially considering minimal compensation spoileronly good side quest father looking family player finds stone bodies mother child tells father leaves area turn stone next really impactful small element player likely notice unless keenly aware wish quests worked like sadly spoilergameplay set new movement skills game allow even greater freedom movement control scheme awful true lasso digging dash really aimed skill aiming cause frustration joy speaking mouse keyboard controls aim truly deceiving sometimes always towards mouse pointer whats worse mouse pointer direction fighting multiple enemies near multiple similarly interactable objects randomize result player try catch incoming projectile grab dangerous enemy instead taking damage try flee jump fray instead recognize moderately well though conversion controller controls still fun parts first game chase sequences well gone really almost shorter much less dramatic bring frustration challenge originally could done first try quick thinking situational awareness well anymore first game clear way obstacles often multiple footholds offered player decides make jump bit longer shorter lenght intended developers could mean loss round floors crumbling soon player almost lands becomes thing boss catching randomly wrong location chosen apparent reason trial error finding plant hook platform land etc much less emphasis placed precise execution instead chases boss fights god player fight several bosses really meaningless large creatures barely get know main one included thrown arena bash move yes played game hard played first one difficulty well far know bosses reasonable lower difficulties easier reasonable ill explain mean take complaint bosses massive health pools sponges incredible variety spam attacks combined small windows damaging retaliation almost certain retaliation still hard though always skill setup healmeeleutility energy recconversion makes relatively easy yet still time consuming defeat feels like abusing game mechanics im fairly certain thats ment defeatedthere terrain awarness creativity involved arenas absolutely empty bland lame attrition battles trial error learn attack patterns sudden terrain changes spoilerand loosign footing final battle along enemy attacks becoming unavoidable hell came spoilerok much rant intended played hollow knight year ago id say game many similar features best stayed closer original designim sure first game ever need continuation definitely wasnt sequel expecting spoilerits ok go different forest narratively really feasible trouble comes nibel close story binding characters niwen really game almost twice long yet arent learning really anything substancial new place characters keep going almost made reasons get stuck life mean probably meant irrevocable closure story felt absolutely rushed completely unwarranted becoming rant im continuingspoilerif first game might would consider playing sequel kinda like hollow knight generally okgoodish game compared expectations brought mostly disappointment first let say game one games sit cutscenes normally want play watch game oh boy reversed wanna graphically stunning game unforgiving much music amazing gameplay fluid cant bring finish game though got stuck part looked guide well warn spoilers sad say finish day today dayi dislike speed trials game say first product review ever done find duty obligation let others know much enjoyed second iteration ori series worried sequel would live first one fears unnecessary game phenomenal around music storyvisuals platformingall wonderfully done game would gladly paid like games making price tag even selling point get flawless game doesnt get goty somethings wrong world forgot equipped two shards buffs enemies hell wondered frame rate issues noticeable means game breaking combat similar hollow knight insane art direction visuals music boot technical issues would go far say better first framerate normally move character seems load textures resources synchronously makes dip fps outside freesync range display due game feels like stuttering time poorly optimized unity game know difficult unity get background resource loading right game needs heavilyi refunding opinion unplayable distracts much experience endure play stutters end hating iti wait see fix issue next updates buy fricking insane cried multiple times fuck mean fuck shit good fucking incredible however sometimes game goes brbrbrbrbrt nearly shit every time fun difficult fun game level design later stages pure anal noticeable bugs well buggy control time time also die time buggy control happens fun game make sad head voice go away fun game overall experience first one everybody though even hard difficulty pretty easy relaxing game theres much challenge like hollow knight die go back checkpoint trek back retrieve currency lost die respawn area lost shards game try find make jump die trying consequences pretty relaxing adult excuse able solve puzzles obstacles way childrens game prefer use game pad keyboard game feels better kbm controls work fine game year doom eternal horizon zero dawn get game matter like best game ive played long time music art damn beautiful story good always makes wanna one thing man game good game lmao kind furry bait though deep personal disgust furries great game play itmy problem underwater controls horrible hate worst cant ori swim fast default holding space time kills finger hitting wasd hitting controll simultaniously impossible game breaking bugs completion whenever load save stuck falling empty void technical issues plagued previous game bit glitchy still times youre middle platforming game randomly go dark hud still take damage slowlyor stand darkgive another week purchasing clear mess poor qt probably lead approved throughits happened already game gorgeous fun challenging thing game lacks stability game suffers first start take minutes game starts run smoothly problems game one find wrong fixed stability game would perfect game retardedly annoying exact clone hollow knight drawing money bosses rigged af dont buy game unfairly difficult hard see water eyes game looks great sound works nice getting stuck stupid places able get wil auto save stupid place restart game ori going anywhere using speed thing expect want go game made lot heart love art style frustrating sequences many first game end satisfying get game sucks humans disguised game ok best boring worse gameplaygreatartbeautifulsoundwonderfulstoryabsolutely littered holes ending characters lack development really made dislike game whole ending especially felt like switcharoo start game entirely killed interest completing end beat game oh boy lackluster dissapointing beyond belief god damn thats make sequel taking everything ori blind forest making times better music fantastic art gameplay truly amazing god idk often cry every cutscenes game also ending feel high power goosebump body cry hard good story best visual best soundtrack theres nothing bad game good writing suffers technical issues good times unclear path take smooth game play though good game funif doesnt leave smile face full emotion eat shoe guaranteed fail good game sadly cannot beat good game something negative say
