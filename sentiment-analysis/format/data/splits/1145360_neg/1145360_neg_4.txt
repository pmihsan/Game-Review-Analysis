hit attack finishes knockback special aoe heavy attack meant standard starter weapon also boring instance switched bow second weapon completly changed play suddenly youre playing ranged charges shots heavy hits special sprays several arrows cone front really satisfying use third weapon unlocked spear long range stab special allows throw make return also satisfying use story also nice despite runs still feels refreshing since learn universe characters play instance every time die returned hub theres usually always new dialouge characters dialouges fully voice acted quite nice art attached really entertaining piecing story together runs even comment happened run instance defeat certain boss talk character may comment fact defeated criticism could give game would upgrades buy runs could bit interesting arent many upgrades even buy think like total quite uninteresting like giving bit extra damage backstab hp starting gold also another form upgrades give weapon one three different
