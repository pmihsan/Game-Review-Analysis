sent underworld afterwards motivation go stages beat final boss see mother players motivation none expected want see persephone role story zagreus mother nothing else want see boring character motivation play game game binding isaac gave player couple motivations beat game first time realized boss beat isnt final boss play see many final bosses also game spacious amount endings intrigued players enough want see go stages beat stage monsters kill stage bosses ive already killed stage bosses entire game beat playthrough beat game beat bosses playthrough beat game bosses game gets repetitive quickly isnt much variety gameplay side binding isaac rich amount gameplay content made game nonrepetitive also told player much playthroughs like every roguelike supposed hades variety focused dialogue amount side dialogues basic get mundane quickly devs probably expected voice acting could save generic writing like giving zagreus peter parkerish kind voice makes character sound sympathetical giving hades authoritarian evil type voice makes sound menacing characters actually say arent interesting though binding isaacs storytelling doesnt depend generic npc dialogues rather isaac goes tboi story unraveled step take foundation roguelike games play games tboi tells story players hades story done finish game rest playthroughs unlock dialogues sound similar ones youve already also amount main weapons theyre even balanced spear bow grenade launcher outperforms weapons isnt much variety weapons either upgrades get playthrough increase damage numbers dont change weapons function even slightly bit gets boring game dashattackdashattack binding isaac one main weapon tears amount function changing upgrades combinations change playstyle makes refreshing funthose main problems hades thats im recommending game im gonna make shortgreat game like supergiant games definitely didnt disappoint one huge issue roguelike mechanic fucking cancerits literally whats

unfolding every time die combat feels tight sound visuals amazing hades pretty much ruined every game play ive played primarily switch purchasing steam im going lie say anything dislike nitpick best yeah good game im roguelikes played dead cells noita cause theyre fun figured ok roguelike seem enjoyable pick hades whimive playing game almost every night time ofc tell fell asleep lava game put bed tired slowly drifting offanyway woke sounds ass fire could save died start whole show beginning againimmediately following resurrection greeted god sleep made joke falling asleep lavaim something run ive managed beat game onceif want info gameplay read reviews im gonna say move cocaine theres new crack town im normally roguelike kinda guy hades hit little addiction centre spot onmostly characters like zag going interactions characters game progresses death death really rewarding im one leave detailed reviewsbutim going eithergood game though im proud much time spent playing first week installing game scratched itch way many games smooth tactical challenging mostly combat enough story keep interested say endgame content get little bit stale learn enemyboss mechanics strong build paths gets much easier said still keep getting pulled back cause core gameplay damn satisfying im quite sure game cant stop running time time maybe variety options kit maybe grindy nature achievements either way ive logged short runs game ive enjoyed least past ill admit bit frustrating start find runs end becomes bit rage game fail finally break really easy enjoy since know limits run work towards consistency overall solid reason didnt go requirements achievements rely lot good rng mindless grinding get text one character gets frustrating fast going runs one reason getting besides game incredible im really roguelikeslites cant stop playing hades im really rogue likes game manages fix biggest problem genre idea losing progress run im sure ever game wanted like hades beautifully presented gorgeous handdrawn artwork excellent score remarkably wellwritten managing successfully tell meaningful story genre typically focused gameplay unfortunately sad truth hours play time ive found supergiants foray action roguelike genre deeply profoundly unlikable collection bad ideas masked lovely veneerthe egregious offender progression system difficulty selection customizable letting pick list modifiers enemy health challenging bosses etc run way continue story advance quests upgrade weapons collect bounties bosses ever increasing number modifiers turned however best way upgrade character repeatedly beating bosses difficulty earning extra bounties strangely enough beating bosses significantly higher difficulty result extra rewards means optimal way play slowly increasing number difficulty modifiers laboriously farming bounties need progress game occasionally going back base difficulty want upgrade character grind wasnt tedious enough also need specific npc dialogue progress story took around escape attempts fresh save file somewhere hours play time get epilogue remarkable dedicated iintentionally suicidingi run getting certain character say right thingmaybe id less critical sheer grind hades puts core gameplay good enough support sadly anything combat mechanics deeply fundamentally flawed large number enemies later levels practically bosses soak prodigious amount damage time partially totally immune stuns debuffs makes combat feel less like hackandslash like dashandmash developing repetitive stress injury dodging countering attacks dozens times row idea challenge game seems unable provide anything else game require quite lot fast precise changes position hades controls extremely poorly using controller makes difficult target enemies whether terrible aim assist option turned lack diagonals mouseandkeyboard configuration makes hard move direction wanti already noted hades pretty obvious developers took lot time give weapon aspect attack upgrade unique appearance perhaps done slightly worse job visual clutter resulting multiple upgrade effects activating time frequently make impossible see happening onscreen becomes even frustrating get area enemies attacks similar color add poorlytelegraphed projectiles shooting offscreen isometric perspective makes harder hide behind things tiny enemies fast erratic movement result frustrating experience pits player legions hell art direction really wish could recommend hades misadventures prince zagreus world snarky gods noble heroes various mythological weirdos wonderfully entertaining even theyre drip fed course several dozen samey button mashy hours maybe monotonous grind game forces onto player carries thematic overtones characters trapped inescapable cycle death resurrection yadda yadda etc etc interest speculating whether bad legitimate narrative choice unhappy coincidence make mistake however hades bad cant recommend perhaps one day supergiant make game plays good looks doesnt seem like step right direction im trapped youre trapped im ready suffer im ready uninstall move made outside salty fuck cleaved half knowing moveset thats ending zag rest degenerates hell rot eternity fun realize elysium full annoying super tanky hp sponge fucks fully revive bonus fuck dude lacks damage proportional hp damage reduction fucking elysium runs cause physical fucking pain button mashing attacks top mental anguish failing dodge rainbow lgbt bullet hell tag team homos end much armor hp im bad im someone whos never enjoyed roguelikes binding wasnt rogue legacy wasnt ftl right theme also didnt draw replay againthisthis groundbreaking regards genre maybe itll wellthis roguelike dont mind losing immediately get urge go another run point successfully time reviewits damn good roguelike game bit story tellingsick stuff im starting wonder supergiant games even capable making bad game culmination talents angle quality unprecedented industry game hades exception fact feel apology order wasnt expecting much story game learned would roguelike couldnt possibly engaging story interwoven around game mechanic core principle repeat events several times wrong pulled
