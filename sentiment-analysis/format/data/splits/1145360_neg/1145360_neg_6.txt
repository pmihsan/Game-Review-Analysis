quite soon content thats dead cells lot diverse regard early access well see get bit grindy pretty good problems different bossfights bossfights boring attacks strategies especially going many times runs get really repetitive considering follow path every run get bit boring previous problem songs ost stood outif like variety roguelikes id say dead cells better option solid rare game polished

story combat top notch supergiant knocks part againedit unfortunately one updateshas broken player viewmodel doesnt face direction movement also doesnt let reorient direction charge attacks clicking

dropping game fps today ive playing days would give type game problem gets patchedfixed id give fun hack slash game u like shit greek gods bullshit hell game lot like dead cells game play baston story telling roguelite emphasis story whereas roguelikeslites failed run feel like waste time hades even failed run theres new dialogue everyone house hades combat feels fluid boon system provides lot replay value addicting really good way game says death odstacle time die wanna play see upgrades gey get stronger would recommend bloody good fucking good really fucking good dont even play dungeon crawlers game hard describe exactly makes hades excellent button mashing static camera game shouldnt work complexity runs well character life shown small talk story bits mesh make game excels gameplay story supergiant quality best level detail polish every mechanic character environment greatalso liked insane amount combinations flexibility skill system transistor gave rejoice games progression similar except multiple weapon types combat much much faster much fucking grind fight tiny group enemies levels many goddamn times unlock stuff gameplay fine except habit making bosses spam adds instead difficulty justits much stuff pretty well made stuff ive played like hours im already bored intro area like playing diablo god war meshed together finger dexterity must expect many runs get better thing missing online pvp would definitely seal deal still havent beat seem like expanded also dont need crazy computer run well definitely recommend nice dont really know lot analisis hasnt gotten boring time played plus keeps gettin updates every bastion transistor atleast youre playing nba jams really damn good really fucking good really fucking good dont think twice buying damn good fucking good ujst sick addicting especially youve sunk lot time sts similar action rougelites theres way game trying escape hell almost hours im still progressing character arcs learning builds synergize finally unlocking alternate weapon forms change combat gorgeous fluid well looking forward future updates since still production ive beaten still cant stop coming back fast paced fun one favs cant wait next update ive thinking getting game glad finally didbtw im hours still havnt beat final boss game difficult rightupdate im disappointed nerfedruined chaos shield je suis proche de la centaine dheures de jeu alors je crois que cest le bon moment de faire critique tout dabord je dois dire que ce jeu nourri fascination pour la mythologie et les bonnes histoires pour un roguelite lhistoire est bien et surtout ceci dit jai la principale environ heures de jeu et jai atteint la fin de la secondaire heures de jeu maintenant que cest fait je ne pourrais dire pour combien de temps le jeu va retenir mon attention il manque quelques et jy reviendrai probablement seulement pour quelques heures par semaine le jeu est bien entendu par contre il assez pour rendre la chose et aucune de mes pour de lenfer ne paru semblable une autrepour finir je recommande fortement ce jeu quiconque aime les jeux du genre il usera fortement les boutons de votre manette mais en vaut la peine jogo excelente mesmo quem curte muito roguelike provavelmente vai curtir pois jogo tem e utiliza seu como uma forma muito bacana de narrativa disso jogo possui uma identidade visual e sonora destaque pra dubagem que expetacular e traz muita vida e para os personagens considerando que maiora dos personagen aparecem apenas como imagens ao gameplay ele muito bom controles e responsivos muito gostoso de jogar e cada arma possui sua particularidade os pactos permitem uns builds bastante interessantes e que muitas vezes instigam que eles aparecem cada run continuarei jogando por mais um tempo geralmente ligo para platinar jogos principalmente pc mas esse jogo tentarei fazer tudo jogo excepcional finalmente um jogo da supergiant games que realmente agradou fim e mais endgame um roguelike viciante mais que deadcells muito bem polido e com um endgame incentivador e divertido e principal diferente de deadcells e da maioria dos roguelikes hades ainda tem uma bela entremeada com dezenas de tentativas de sair underworld recomendo jogabilidade jogabilidade em com e combate um total de armas principais com estilos de jogo diferentes entrarei em detalhes mas da bloodstone em um dos de ataque uma camada especial este jogo roguelike com em riqueza de detalhes e polimento jogando com zagreus filho de hades vc conta com apoio de personagens e deuses cada um com sua personalidade zagreus um personagem muito bem escrito e impressionante quantidade de linhas de feitas para este jogo reagindo cada tipo de escolha e acontecimentos em cada gameplay se desenvolve em paralelo tentativas de fuga underworld pra mim um dos pontos altos jogo dificuldade progressiva e justa jogo nunca parece injusto e vc sempre evoluindo seu personagem mesmo com rng de um roguelike hades nunca parece injusto com probabilidades diferente de deadcells que liberar diversas blueprints na verdade prejudica sua probabilidade de sucesso replayability mesmo zerar jogo seu endgame viciante diferente de deadcells que realmente tem empolga coletar itens em algumas runs pra fazer boss secreto zerei com umas horas mas continuo jogando para saber mais detalhes da novos upgrades e bossescontras certas de skills principalmente das relacionadas bloodstones e upgrades martelo precisavam de um mini explicativo para te auxiliar na escolha dos upgrades quando os deuses aparecem os itens raros que dropam de bosses titan blood diamond e ambrosia deveriam ter sua utilidade explicada pois um jogador pode com coisas por exemplo titan blood fundamental pros upgrades das armas algo que jogo e ele fica horas e horas seu precisa liberar armas pra poder fazer os upgrades e descobri isso sozinho alguns deuses tem um skillset bem de outros deuses algumas currencies tem drops bem baixos visto sua e quantidade como um jogo acho q empresa dar uma calibrada nas currencies nos patches jugabilidad versatilidad rejugabilidad dificultad manejo de personajes e historia excelentes de verdad es una haberlo nominado juego del del que haya ganado algunos de esos galardones en ciertos medios especializados por cierto si eres dotero te gusto el laberinto de aghanim es obligatorio que pruebes este juego juicy ass

underworld daddy pls help cant stop playing pode colocar na lista candidato ao jogo ano de que supergiant games fez nesse jogo foi simplesmente reconhecer ponto mais importante de um roguelike e amarrar nessa um motivo pelo qual te faz toda vez voltar ao jogo como zagreu tem objetivo de fugir submundo controlado pelo seu pai que nome ao jogo hades quantidade de personagens suas seus trejeitos e desenvolvimento relacionamento seu personagem com cada um importante que liga mais de morrer jogo porque sabe que muita coisa esperando novamente em sua casagaranto que se muito de roguelike ainda sim muito se gosta como eu se prepare pois pode passar de horas se divertindo com cada nova frase ou piada soltada por cada um possibly one best investments made one roguelites truly enjoy playing despite bad dialogue though fucking amazing prepare uncontrollably horny attempts escape hell also pet dog prepare die feel bad editionmost satisfying grind ive ever experiencedmust prepare waste many

synergies create problem game much invulnerabilitydamage avoidance enemies bosses getting invuln bubbles really lame frustrating especially time restrictions enacted pretty solid game really bad things speak extremely well done previous review literally perfect game theres way forwards everything doesnt seem pointless feeling achievement progress feels fulfilling full interesting characters story development run forces different tactics forced adapt different skills levels new favourite game xcurrently game glitched deleted run nearly finished honestly feels like ive wasted much time game ruined games bad saving system glitch primer roguelike que mando en un principio que pero es muy por la calidad de la narrativa de los personajes sin mencionar que por que te mueras te da ganas de desinstalar sino que quieres seguir tratando solo para ver hablar de nuevo tu personaje favorito el soundtrack es una joyita prothe actually gameplay fluid responsive voice acting really good beginning long blabla long tutorial get action really quick gameplay weapons modifiable totally playstyles conbut doesnt matter mechanics boring integrated simple stat increase like crit luck etc boring biomes look sameish veteran player feels like something already played dozend times soundtrack doesnt really stand opinion enemy types could many behave sameish dash much integrated game taht means shit flying place traps everywhere etc use die thats personal opinion probably closer hours offline playnever thought roguelike could make compelling story compensates replay successes failures game kicks ass probably favourite game last years dont seem get bored playing probably favourite game year manages roguelite fail engaging story makes want another run even gameplay probably game year well made sucks hours time probably one favourite supergiant games far aesthetic great gameplay smooth frustrating die rerun areas would definitely recommend probably one best roguelikes ive played might even say period went game plans commitment grabbed peepee wouldnt let go tickled hours writing even reaching epilogue seemingly everything im still playing game genre dont often focus story came super giant big dick rpg writers making narrative meshes sooo well gameplay loopit felt different music voices art direction everything thought done well youre vibin characters narrative gameplay alone could hold addicting one fun games ive played ever shit qualityeasy highly recommended probably best action rogue lite market build varieties anywhere mediocre astonishingly broken depending rngesus planning would kill daddy hades probably best roguelite games right next binding isaac characters conversations story really make game wanting die run excited conversations able u die events happen combat simplified rep supergiant one definately favorite game year probably dynamic roguelike ever hours even close getting bored game theres always something new discoverpros always different conversations story archs unfold every different run combination top notch voiceacting awesome characters one enjoyable portrayals pantheon gameplay extremely fluid optimization incredible never frame drop ancient laptop balance perfect fail time incompetence games bullshit rng
