list goes double jump added unlimited sprint featured games feel mobile ever areas clearly designed give players good platforming skills bit advantage certain vantage points appear reach almost always accessed precise jumping scenery movement fighting feel great nearly whole map built nighconstant basisthere also new rpg elements id say mostly welcome addition although good bit bigger previous games youngbloods rpg elements still lighter side things level ups increasing base damage health armor enemy levels mattering theyre several levels higher probably biggest annoyance enemies five levels higher get bridiculousb damage multiplier effectively lets oneshot even easy difficulties eventually youll level enough game scale enemies issue disappears first hours id take special care avoiding highlevel enemies get least rpg elements much welcome weapon upgrade system improvement new colossuss dont need find specific kits anymore buy weapon upgrades want multiple slots three upgrades apply boost damage accuracy change guns functionality tempting constantly invest pure damage builds ive lot fun experimenting different loadouts games bfg bypass long charge time entirely right loadout making useful mobs elite mooks move quicker big mech bosstype enemies freely swap upgrades anytimethe pep system interesting addition twins give buff every minute youll start basic ones increases armor health unlock unique ones complicated add bit strategy next ability unlocks use simple point system get one point per level one point finishing quests abilities come stacked one nine rows need unlock first ability row unlock second etcon systems simple combined really feel like youre playing role appropriate something thats part rpg youre never locked anything enough patience could grind way master everything knowing probably eventually weapons gain individual damage bonuses kills score upgrades costly means entirety main quests youll probably feel weight tactical choicesmy friend specialized durability dualwielding uzis lategame turned absolute menace anything lightly armored worse whereas id taken perks melee ability carry use heavy weapons letting stun super soldiers tackles whip uberhammer absolute biggest big baddies neither us patience stealth cloak numerous weapons silencer upgrades theres potential play game methodically hilariously hurling axes peoples faces cloakedalthough played lot game coop found solo works fine well ai partner unlimited cloak anytime attempt stealth enemy ai seems programmed ignore unless youre spotted first theyre usually pretty good reviving hit button call help first sure dont revive default assume occasionally might advantageous bleed use one spare lives instead risking getting downed well biggest issue noticed ai occasionally gets confused youve scaled harder reach places mapi gripes systems place though already mentioned highlevel enemies cheap shotting early game theres also damage system certain weapons useful certain enemy types simple theres two types enemy armor guns good one issue symbols chosen represent different armors understated similar simple white boxes white dashes easy mix middle fight merely colorcoding would made things much easier avoid issue making already hardy enemies appear invulnerable youre using wrong weapon dont realize itmost biggest problems game technical ive couple ctds quest glitch due trying friends game already completed ive lot issues connectivity terrible internet general still ive played online games less issues ive noticed problems worse peak hours hopefully server congestion settle time annoyingly game uses bethesdas network despite steam think skip turning steam profile public bnet import friends list added annoying extra step trying play friendthere big set pieces compared new order colossus expected lower budgeted spinoff although like frantic pace wouldnt minded story beats combination banter incidental dialogue tons readables good job fleshing world continues biting political commentary love previous games dont learn whole lot characters beyond broad strokes twins little arc course story likewise implications ending issues raise interesting feel vague possibly set wolfenstein iii machinegames didnt want spoil anything majoroverall absolute blast youngblood probably fun ive coop game since played entirety saints row friend decade ago look forward playing still general gameplay loop addictive definitely worth spring deluxe edition invite friend doesnt game play nearly good previous wolfenstein titles even worth dont like bethesda theyre bad company many anticonsumer practices ill put aside review focus good bad points gamepros good extremely fast load times game runs really like weapon mastery mechanic game fact rewards playing gun modification always fun although basically choose ammo dmg accuracycons game short completed main quest imo isnt worth plot holes big jump seriously two big plot guns entire game excluding heavy weapons limited ammo theres literally pistolauto pistol machine gunheavy machine gun shotgun grenade launcher railgun lightning gun thats theres sniper rifle game literally first thing see start playing game bj blazkowicz training daughter shoot sniper rifle sick joke bethesda turns theres sniper rifle entire game oh wait put magnification scope facking pistol yeah theres sniper rifle right sick sense humor bethesda even though completed game looked game statistics kills game thats supposed entire nazi regime kills disappointing selecting weapon wheel time isnt slowed paused something become pretty much standard fps games yet youngblood doesnt feature instead get head blown youre scrolling weapon wheel searching gun ammo lean corner look game cant customize keys wanna make leaning qe like pretty much fps games nope picking ammo consumes entire stack lets say gun missing ammo theres entire crate ammo ground pick entire crate consumed gain ammo thats grenades throwables dont gain weapon mastery youre literally losing mastery guns time decide throw multiple quests cant tracked time results many trips back place game doesnt tell youre near quest even standing right next objective game wont indicate anything tutorials come form little laptops pick read laptops come way late didnt know could doublejump little laptop told already passed placed could doublejumped get hidden loot ended backtrack long distance get loot could gotten knew could logging bethesda account takes upwards cant anything cant even go game youre logged many items autopickup spend minutes time running around searching loot area passed supposed fps game bloody skyrim stuff pockets full youre playing singleplayer sister often say hey theres something hey come check normally would indicate object interest yet says gives zero indication noticed doesnt mark item doesnt point doesnt even stand next literally says voice line expects search entire immediate area ever doors previously opened often closed return area big problem since many doors opened one side leaves unable access area unless backtrack way back first place open door infuriating oversight game start

awesome graphics amazing rpg element nice change pace think people upset fact story driven like first ones people need realize spin offered cheap begin nice trade still recommend getting sale youll way fun friend decent sized community youll get random matches fairly often good long dont expect dollar game wolfenstein game wish never played strength wolfenstein reboot franchise features two greatest releases recent fps history lies combination snappy writing compelling world character design exceptional gunplay stealth mechanics game unfortunately none qualities writing cute times passable shooter game although sisters dialogues belong life strange game wolfenstein game never introspective exciting two mainline entries series absence lovetohate antagonists particularly noticeable story largely nonexistent premise find dadenemy weapon designs mostly recycled previous game little innovation despite game taking place nearly years new colossus even though take place historic paris games levels snoozers without even half personality tnos europe tncs americagameplaywise game attempted adopt certain mechanics looter shooter genre turning every enemy bullet sponge visible health bar peppering levels inane collectibles currencies character even levels rack body count granting mostly useless upgrades abilities fails two reasons transcendent gunplay stealth first two games completely negated instance headshots longer kill nazis one bullet every attempt stealthily clearing area immediately turn firefight barely satisfying win another example previous games could play tactically instance shooting enemies legs disable crucial seconds deal pressing target game simply shoot things health bar reaches zero loot game looter shooter without loot enemies drop aforementioned currencies use marginally upgrade guns mystifyingly game also microtransactions letting pay real money acquire gold bars use buy skins characters guns wholly unnecessary game playing one person games saving grace coop add layer fun largely notfun game team friend one could argue however game multiplayer fun play friends matter shitty wolfenstein youngblood failed experiment disregards everything makes previous games franchise great trying wolfenstein destiny time ignoring best parts games implementing worst even possible make killing nazis fun wouldnt recommend anyone unless wolfenstein head get sale less game bit departure wolfenstein formula really dont think thats bad thing spinoff fun game fun bugs im enjoying shooting amazing played beat game really fun game would fun wernt required revive ai sister goes every seconds boss fight fun game enjoy part agree criticism game got though dialog corny uninteresting left levels feel mission design uninspired look past issues game enjoyable play runs great machine honestly fun playing much better hope isnt sign things come series really enjoyed wolfenstein sad see heading wrong path go back single player focus good storys think wanted anything wolfenstein could happy adding weapons different armor types game game really little anything add anything positive series id still recommend weapon mechanics good like fps games enjoy wolfenstein game dont know bethesda publisher pushing studios take really successful franchise change game play bull reason change game play push micro transactions another fallout one like play fallout still fallout game way doesnt feel like wolfenstein game like old games bit open still good run gun style nazi killing game isnt funin fact didnt even want play game really wanted play game first two enjoyable system mission doesnt seem neccessary feel like shouldve able get skins playing missions instead earning money tldr game little hard write review ultimately shooting good makes recommend multiple technical levels fails want get wait salethe coop matchmaking completely random level matched level due leveling system weapons near useless ai teammate get playing okay firefight mostly bullet sponge frequently bugs hangs back doesnt try revive get knocked downstory ok protagonists didnt really bother much people guesslevelingrpg system largely unnecessarythere difficulty spike early largely due heavily armored enemies continue playing get weapons abilities counter armor frustrating thenlevel design quest hub several fairly open areas pretty
