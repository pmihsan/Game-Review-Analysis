another far cry new dawn level enemies levels shields gradually harder get lesser known aspect weapons game affect different shields pairing smartly take whatever enemy ahead cool aspect enemies bullet sponges im co op person love experience games pace first thought id forced co op game thankfully thought ai partner allow go solo part shes alright get fucking last boss ai follows around much leads explosives runs boss dies lives left forcing risk save restart mention first phase boss need target back since fucking ai follows faces entire time needs way control ai smarter seriously enjoying aspects leveling getting skills upgrading guns really fun progression think would really work given aspects improve level requirements raid missions actually got excited side quests level fairly quickly however even though finish game less hours levels extremely repetitive going back areas time time againspeaking levels repetitive even mention theyre insanely confusing times markers strange without map view whole level extremely confusing lastly story enjoy little besides super short premise finding bj got keen twist midway huge revelation got keen games villian built well hardly even care final thought aswell characters built games arent max set even ferguswyatt idea feels like small game really keen play missing everything wolfenstein games built game fun quite lot issuesi enjoy able freely explore world many little details like bethesda games large issues almost made quit someone playing game couldnt use metro system spent minutes trying find way actually continue playing issues include communication ive played game one guy good mic fun play rest afk didnt work blatantly horrible play screeching mic ruining game needs report system implementedother game doesnt really explain lot things crashy bethesda game regardless fairly horrible online experience ludicrous addition believe fun game ive quite enjoyed playing faredit another horrible experience would like add would brother raid contains spoilers spoiler fighting way underground system made way brother unlock weapon essentially shoots electricity open doors group damage building tried everything could get locked room white doors locked appeared way inside friend playing decided waste time would try later fought way back raid go back beginning realise unlike missions couldnt exit come back later finish last attempt get noticed covered vent collapsed bridge platform finally got weapon spoiler im sure within month two guides released people get stuck stuff like seems every bethesda game stupid moments like positive side ive enjoyed playing game change fairly point point b story mode type game open world rpg bold move welcome changeanother thing want point never spend money gold pay win bs within hours youll every gun unlocked upgraded pretty highly least half abilities game fun checkpoints game stupid something takes hours die quickly find way back start annoying game way hard play even easiest mode enemies still bulletsponges slowly heal inflict enough damage certain enemies like supersoldiers never issues like playing wolfenstein games wolfenstein games played one fun game needs drop price seems sweet spot developer wants recoup development income spent promising game fell short couldve game runs stable fps second highest setting using ti many games graphics achieve im giving thumb game clearly made machine games instead entirely arkanes fault theyre fine studio idea make game like shows grindy repetitive looter shooter forced coop shallow short ultimately unsatisfying story awful writing everyone talking theyre kidding course gunplay graphics topnotch theyre brought wolf ii thats compliments game gets unless youre wolfenstein superfan avoid one wait third installment main series hopefully machine games project game great beat base game friend thats far game way better actually expected good rpg stuff quite bit quests story could used work though bugs nothing game breaking game highly anticipated everyone ever played one wolfenstein games wolfenstein youngblood much potential even really good franchise really good developers make oopsie friend finished game together sure intense wasnt exciting thought disgustingly difficult dont know machinegames bethesda thinking general failure wolfenstein game honestly game panned critics lot players fan recent machinegames wolfenstein games knew wanted give try judge tldr terrible moderately fun coop pretty repetitive mediocre story elaborate bit initially really didnt mind addition rpg elements initial impression positively adding complexity would otherwise mindless shooter opinion sort changed course first couple hours honestly didnt really mind upgrades sisters progressively gaining health armor pretty basic premise really didnt care gun upgrades call upgrades opinion less would applied upgrades would enjoyed upgrading guns linear fashion make progressively powerful thats guns work youngblood gun different parts made different vendors different tradeoffs game didnt find time comparing stats different parts vendors enjoyable didnt go youngblood prepared rpgmindset felt cumbersome understand goal probably provide player choice ended picking couple upgrades spent rest game ignoring frequent upgrades available notification offensive aspect youngblood though quests gone linear chapterbased progression previous wolfenstein games youngblood yet another attempt bethesda create liveservice game main quests side quests pretty indiscernible one another main quest requires breach three large fortresses side quests given afterthefact require revisit three areas theres real meaningful dialogue story whatever macguffin side quest uses justify existence theres pretty much unlimited number procedurally generated quests game literally ends message says abby always new queststhe sistersyeah theyre pretty cringey mean theyre like game overly edgy maybe theyre relatable likable someone age group personally found bit immature combine quest design limited number recorded remarks sisters say combat yeah found little bit annoying hearing youre slayin jess timesthe best scene game spoiler undoubtedly finding bj honestly kind crazy considering origins wolfenstein series likeable machinegames made bj since taking reins unfortunately bjs time onscreen youngblood short spoilerthis another one games really wish steam neutral option fun playing coop friend yeah would ever recommend playing solo absolutely game quite fun friend mine understand negative reviews personally enjoyed game good even free get game unplayable solo better someone else want go hell repeat game unplayable solo game make fallout like good game stay away game warning stay away game would awesome crash updated video drivers worked fine crashed went play said error wanted start game love wolfenstien played hours want begin way instalment departs linear journey game seen previous instalments works like freedom open world approach plan encounters run away others youre levelled youd rather focused plot driven experience might want think twice one ties customisation options look pretty good far might frustrate youd rather get brings point game political statement really really isnt unless thought shooting nazis offends theres one kind person feels like go guess new order old blood new colossus feels like entirely different game wolfenstein skin weapons arent impactful dont feel heavy fire like im shooting rock wall hit enemies gun play one best parts games combat feels hollow like might well knife every enemy alsowhere hell pause button gotta get coffee take poo feed cats gotta hope run back level far enough dont get killed god sake kind game doesnt pause button story within first minutes felt disjointed scattered kinda cookie cutter get game feel like im racing get currency unlock things didnt feel like trying find happening charactersat ive waiting game nearly year suppose expectations high wolfenstein reviews stated looter shooter big shallow oceanthe hours game play everything else inch deepmaybe played might change mind though im refunding sale happens complete different take rest modern wolfenstein games taken bad one gameplay follows rpg turn levels actually dont end mattering world levels gain abilities make much capable along way movement really excelled games game continues trend sure setup coop solo able beat normal take found enough coins everything wanted buy microtransactions werent problem basically liked hope go back pure fps wolfenstein decent game right price gameplay game straight forward simple interesting plot follow played hours game truly enjoy open world aspect game brings table game blend interesting elements dishonored prey notably player explore discover different areas map criticisms hear mostly people chose critique game full priced aaa tittle yet without calculating fact game critiques ai

small details like posters walls music thats playedcons stupid gameplay silly missions enemies respawn going back last area areas different missions encounter exactloy enemies able manual save load

guns parts suits find usd coins suits full developed gun cost etc great around game best worfenstein games plus rtx looks good great game first like different expecting eased playing realized much changes made game better example even though play friends love playing ai teammate opposed single player world gorgeous incredibly creative humor better hated seriousness last wolfenstein game cmon nazis moon game taken seriously greater variety enemies makes fun firefights overall far ok fps game wolfenstein window dressing none excellent narrativestory weve come expect modern wolfenstein fact theres barely story blaskovics daughters save nazis thats basically whole story isnt horrible fps far fun choices got sale got full price hard pass small sidegame play friend third part trilogy dont go thinking going like new order new colossus regarding scope storyor even parts gameplay like new rpg system enemies bulletsponges like arcady fast goofy shooter main characters seem based beavis butthead something light enjoy waiting third installment price right recommended solid continuation wolfenstein storyline coop aspect adds new challenge gameplay game length reflected price dont doubt people plenty fun multiplayer side fence controls similar previous iterations game added difficulties longer remove turrets use heavy weapons though pick heavy weapons store inventory associated skill moving covertly level far difficult especially considering coop weapon powerups driven collected cash upgraded time tailored playing style dont provide much advantage combatthe biggest change playing style game leveling aspect kills discoveries missions generate xp levels character increasing overall damage providing skill points player spend additional combat advantage biggest drawback needing pay close attention attacking possible wander areas city enemy levels far especially initially cant win specific area helps leave try somewhere else powered enough come back real damage actually functions well mechanic reduces overall linear feel story spite significantly smaller playing area past games sum cheap fun game enjoy friends brings history wolfenstein games table adding new mechanics enhance playability smaller game sweet game terrible game tries balancing coop singleplayer manages wrong places couldnt finish watched cinematic movie cutscenes youtube movie clearly understood dare say good sisters quirky bj blazkowicz cool happened grace unexpected point game story tie cutscenes everything explained cutscenesif movie would good nice feeling anticipation upcoming games game terrible makes us wish something like never happen hope next gamehopefully prequel bj protagonist better least equal previous games conditional recommendation get deep discount dont care story characters games gunplay pretty decent two guns satisfying shoot pretty good level design allowing multiple approaches verticality aesthetics spot imagine dystopian nazi controlled paris look many performance issues bugs vary rarely would get light stutter nothing major crashes cool boss fights deep upgrade tree reasonably well designed decent stealth option submachinegun shotgun trash even full upgrades feel damage output twins hilariously bad characters huge favour skip every single cutscene story general garbagetier massive grind going achievements recommend farming first level stealth cash quickest way get weapon upgrades coop option subpar hardly anyone playing different take wolfenstein style gameplay title adds great deal depth character customization leveling perks lot consider using ai since must always play two players game lot fun times great deal challenge recommend wolfenstein player avid series fun game play dollars cant beat coop works great game looks great rarely see bug game would recommend game anyone someone play good several weekends gaming hours still lots collectibles side missions complete would buy choose well made coop shooter light rpg elements want kill nazis together friend wont go wrong buying game havent played singleplayer cant speak aspectthe story adequate far im seven hours many side missions basic premise bj blazkowicz hero previous wolfenstein games mysteriously disappeared daughters decide go find journey become badbottomed nazi killersthe missions delivered much naturally games via dialogue listen rather block text random events happen mission intel captives need freed spice typical gohereanddothiswhilekillingeverythingthatmoves missions missions arent particularly interesting theyre fun play friendthe gun play feels good solid isnt really anything particularly special honestly doesnt need fact modupgrade weapons match play style nice touch means firearms look play differently friends weaponrythe power suits also upgradeable means abilities play style different friends unless choose exact skills abilitiesthe coop well implemented working together required spots pulling two levers different areas etc delightful cause havoc enemy friend flank tear little nazi shredsthe rpg elements work well feel difference level abilities isnt lot unique well implementedtheres bit open world aspect well travel areas arent ready get butt handed youoverall ive blast playing friend would recommend anyone wants fun wellcrafted firstperson shooter experience friend play wonderful game anyone says isnt probably cant handle go back minecraft alot fun friend much cooperation greater tactics enjoyable game wolfenstein franchise sadly always online title microtransactions gunplay satisfying honestly cant recommend game predatory elementsif want play game solo host offline game tell enough experiment developer dont feel like playing forced several times trying continue couldnt awesome game really like halflife wolfenstein far cry blood dragon game literally far cry new dawn wolfenstien good ole coop guns blazin fun get game kill nazis save daddy meant wolfenstein preordered game meant wolfenstein trailers advertised wolfenstein nazi killing fast faced top weapons blowing crap thingsinstead got top weapons sod enemies unless theyre way level haved play literally hour cant anymore rpg elements removed least altered give wolfenstein feel gameplay cant recommend game current state want cant wolfenstein sets apart coop spinoff good friend play get game wolfenstein sets apart coop spinoff instead bj get teenage girls sets stage story game play much better people ai bot works well solo stay close side wander fire fight shell die skill tree weapon upgrades fit within game progress accordingly recent patch added new content expand game play like coop dont mind girls good fun way play final point weapons max enemy get stronger harder kill weapon remains wolfenstein game game set wolfenstein universe short grindy gameplay fun enjoyable traditional wolfenstein experience wouldnt recommend solo game u someone always looking fun coop friend random get thereton fun girls funny weird borderline psychotic way game works fairly well game breaking issues scenery setting look amazing coop mechanics mean certainly need work together hparmour shared need constantly buffing screw bethsoft haters want good coop experience bit laugh give go probably going get flack many good things many bad things game expect get fixed newer patches like last ones like really like flow killing nazis matter repetitive still fun played multiplayer friends online randoms thought deluxe version sharing game cheap friend pay nice concept another hyper imaginative nazi killing simulator really wanted fact youre playing terrorbillys twin children great fan service regards keeping lorethe premise story great idea however quickly becomes predictable nonsensical time voice acting horrible hearing two girls talk forced southern accents trying sound like father feels forced place upgrade paths skill points weapon upgrades changed rpg style upgrading like direction previous games upgrade health armor carrying capacity etc complete arbitrary tasks time using specific weapons didnt want grind kills turret get extra armor get skill points leveling completing certain story missions get choose upgrade get use guns want without specifically use guns dont typically use upgrade paths weapons like dont like used find weapon upgrade collectible items didnt find didnt upgrade weapons three paths upgrades various pieces scope stock handle magazine etc problem part gun costs silver eventually get guns upgrading every piece every gun pricey unlocking three paths even pricey level ability improve upgrade chose effective isnt lot money youre running around chests enemies drop youre constantly running around picking money meant grind time consuming want try different upgrade routes test different play styles isnt enough money laying around weapons also increase damage get kills like favorite guns become even better basically run around rifle shotgun super effective promote lack money laying around daily weekly quests complete money bonus experience another way adding filler game im fan dont like idea daily weekly quests way allow player get money max weapons weapons upgrades could cheaper enemies could drop rotating fetch quests isnt going keep players playing gamethis somewhat limited open world different maps explore reminds borderlands missions done complete main mission area bunch fillerfetch quests unlocks another mission hard part area previously locked repetitive fun areas explore find collectibles lot design reused stairs boards lead apartment food tables scissor lift climb get window another trashy apartment feels lazy like somewhat open quests order wanted went looking collectibles missed ton unlocked skill shows mini map ai absolute garbage playing single player partner somewhat helpful really reluctant revive die enemies tricked shooting bullets dont hit almost every spot bigger robots spot kite enemy dies ai stupid shot needs kommandants quite often watch kill enemy units without ever firing sometimes run walls like new enemy designs like tiered enemies alarms going like even higher tiered enemies alarm going kommandant nearby clipping unreal ive gotten stuck many times drives absolutely insane many times quit reopen game due getting stuck clipping wall floor microtransactions game skins guns power armor completely cosmetic necessary every game wont buying people buy know theyre people want stand show unnecessary dumb graphics look ever reskinning enemies make look bit cooler nothing thats really different last think game worth paid wish waited longer patching fix ai clipping would paid game would waited months year go steam sale pick think worth buy maybe wait months patches update glitches fixed least cant recreate recent dlc released added fetch quests chance get skill points however youre still far obtaining skill points grindfest max skills achievement hunting leveling various weapon masteries still cant game without spending money game currency still major disappointment broken game ive ever attempted play still broken almost year releasebethesda clearly gave dealing huge graphical issues complete lack co op functionality reason play janky ass game super computer best internet money buy enjoy otherwise dont bother stay away updated longer recommend read whyas nice looking installments good humor sound etc basically ticks right boxes far lore etc goes fun play later long stay within level soon reach part map level enemies game quickly becomes fun idea areas enter risk isnt new however youve played literally recent elder scrolls fallout game applies big difference games open world choice go mechanics closed map however poor implementation idea different sections map player even able enter areas let alone face characters thats say unbeatable however arent im saying isnt fun isolated game looses points could otherwise great game wasnt points talk aboutnow recommend mistakenly beginning fun

disaster end game ridiculous super hard sophie keeps dying time disaster first saw trailer wolfenstein youngblood thought would terrible level design new colossus mixed two annoying young lead protagonists wrongyoungblood far perfect arkane developers dishonored series created similar open level layout dishonored world design superb packed detail filled clutter easter eggs gorgeous scenery bombed cities mixed heavily mechanized alternate aesthetic really immerses player like dishonored reminds half life soundtrack also amazingmix machine games stunning weapon combat slightly grindy fun leveling system actually forces side missions tackle tougher enemies especially later game two girls also likeable hilarious times especially game blast nazis head clean laugh cheer xdtechnically updated id tech engine stunning well optimized compared new colossus mid lower end systems runs smoothly even test best systems especially ultra uber settings using game currency level big change previous wolfenstein games though game microtransactions theres plenty money game already max everything turn nazi slaying wrecking ball thankfully making purchase microtransactions pointlessthe game played offline singleplayer bot without needing create bethesda account unfortunately play friend online required create account must link steam account hope remove requirement future nearly turned game keep lot players awaythere small issues playing alone ai sister nothing game breaking bit slow revive final boss pretty tough playing ive completed game theres good hours game time sides missions cant go wrong hopefully wolfenstein iii similar design though im fan online coopif fan wolfenstein dishonored get game first came excited found didnt play wellafter coming back finally awesome im super happy made coop wolfenstein game ability weapon upgrades visuals excellent plays nice smooth unlike lot little details ive noticed appreciatethe weird thing hold crouch option toggle crouch forgivable considering everything else seems finealso story feels little aimless far theres enough far maybe itll get better writing hours playedfor game totaly worth friend play withbig bonus friend dosent need buy game invite everything full gamethis feels like weird wolfenstein borderlands crossover borderlands gameplay wolfenstein universebut love good enough opening elevator door animations require players itjust make doors open automatically players need press button goits fine first times gets really annoying get enjoyment game playing co op feel many issues give positive review would neutral possible lower price certainly works games favour co op essential cannot imagine trying solo ai team mate start everything fine game quickly descended grindy mess within hours even normal rank file enemies take shots face fully upgraded shotgun enemies randomly respawn every area bet half game going back areas complete mind numbing side quests developers wanted make similar borderlands level upgrades powers ruined point game like wolfenstein doom got right twins also incredibly annoying well one constantly acting like bro saying dude every seconds fun enough game fill time till big co op games release id avoid till patches line probably pay preferably good previous entries wolfenstein youngblood still overall enjoyable youll want friends play ai often incompetent issues ive run several times clipping floor checkpoints need reworked youll spend lots time replaying long areas youve already done dialogue voice acting average best connection issues frequent could dont best internet visually game impressive combat mostly improved previous installments though level system feel place makes hard anything running gunning perk system weapon modifications good addition would recommend game wait sale deluxe edition worth buddy pass best wolfenstein games near bad people say played totally solo ai completely competent even play stealth except one time game short dont like
