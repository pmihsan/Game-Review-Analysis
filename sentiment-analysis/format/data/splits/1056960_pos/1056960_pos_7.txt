steam add using bethesda id order us actually play together took half hour figure quite ridiculous additional mechanics dont really add much game would good better entirely linear option change weapon mods pick two suit powers use would likely less fun singleplayeronce get going though game fine characters top bad fun mock gunplay movement pretty spot far least favorite wolfenstein even lower price previous releases felt main story weak idea coop fun executed best mechanics like previous games added rpg elements dont really fit well stealth play bad im really sure could properly fit stealth coop

mind two main characters practically behave like two twelve year old boys playing video game even chuckled twice terriblethe badwhat thinking bullet spongy enemies cant put enemies instead making existing enemies unneccesarily hard kill requiring three head shots normal soldier isnt right shouldnt happen wolfenstein game overall grindy nature added rpg mechanics also feels like step wrong

running past redeeming visual qualities order dodge bullet sponge enemies enemy ai awful luckily friend play didnt experience partner ai cutscenes lifeless barely character expression music traveling places often shows map highlighted red play area narration probably interesting werent blank white map explain whole thing zero sense direction coordination often found friend wandering endgame level areas hoof back across three areas supposed go put couple hours game could tell main story blocked time consuming side quests feel like filler game basically fallout wolfenstein expected multiplayer entry series instead suffered catch twentytwo story multiplayer mechanics tldr fans wolfenstein franchise could fun friend personally enjoyed gunplay main story solo side quests sending repetitive nature levels draining hour mark goes without mentioning grind youd max every weapon perk unlock everything achievements would nightmare bright side game runs beautifully pick buddy pass version sale worthwhile buy play friendwolfenstein youngblood side entry franchise similar old blood back twist time coop shooter playing bjs daughters years wolfenstein ii ill front new protagonists didnt bother like reviews ive seen rpg style health bars made sense given coop understand bothered give machinegames arkane benefit doubt game trying new things series thats good games industry needs try new things shaking wolfenstein formula side entry good move innovation im sure guess recommending concepts good execution wasnt smooth sadlybefore games release replayed entire mg wolfenstein series max difficulties completing everything could fell back love gameplay story done say didnt hate game fact initial hours exploring killing nazis main points story quite enjoyable worth purchase clearly built progression system like looter shooter completed every main side mission game every collectable replayed mission try new gunsperks done level clear amount time reach level max perks amount money id grind max every attachment time grind every weapon level going absurd ive heard plans add side missions areas anything really want grind areas countless hours care completing stuff like normally enjoy time knew done finished everything game content barely halfway grind isnt even ng option redo content level like borderlands something game even remotely compares series contentnormally like touch every main part games review anyone wants kinds details game ive already gone long enough mixed bag whole main story fun exploring new areas shooting nazis seeing bj hours satisfied albeit light story got continued side content hunting collectables realized small repetitive games numbers rpg systems big content offer clearly hasty side project since im guessing wolfenstein iii still years catch sale play friend give go youre completionist solo player game grueling continue playing story ends final note microtransactions really arent big deal ive seen people making cant pay real money level get perks get attachments anything gameplay pay money get skins power suit weapon skins earnable game currency honestly pretty cheap care enough save silver really cared character guns look grind bit game weapon skins cheaper attachments upgrades actually benefit gameplay suits dont matter much since first person care arent hard grind ultimately feel pointless arent intrusive offered buy gold bars everything purchase easy obtain game money tldr game wank buy sale besti played hour already know things game ruin really good franchise looks bad high graphics clear cash grabthere also huge gap story could make good single player game get shit takes otherwise amazing series machinegames wolfenstein series ruins dont buy taking franchise new direction good thing case wolfenstein youngblood main differences older games franchise also happen greatest flaws shooting rarely punchy satisfying enemies respawn excessively city levels cramped enemy levelling makes player constantly ineffective side missions often boring ai daft remove cooperative focus trim rpg elements many issues would vanish stands even reduced price title strong choice players looking good single player shooter cooperative gamers find better experiences elsewhere wolfenstein youngblood black sheep franchise hopefully doesnt twin reviewurl terrible split otherwise great franchise disappointed gave hour gave definitely trying refund thank god refunds thank god didnt call wolfenstein still little hope buddy pass wont work invite friend playing demo doesnt receive invite bethesdanet accounts linked etc researched solutions online nothing worksa publisher big able release game flawless cooperative experience especially game made coop division nazi sponges restrictive environments becomes tedious quickly new colossus better story fun old blood new colossus differentlots reviews point young blood different wolfensteins thought would still suggest game price lineage dont think bad game compared predecessors differentits small game hold satiate till next full game would fine waiting though paris catacombs got elite hans arcade machines could possibly wantnot best wolfenstein game series great coop game surprising twists surprises definitely make interesting see happens next major wolfenstein game best game ever played dont regret anything swear best wolfenstein series yet best thing game fun full story lots action amazing graphics best part coop need coop games biggest let ive ever personally video game franchise discovered wolfenstein around time new colussus instantly fell love games played every single one youngblood isnt even wolfenstein game cheap money grab ditches every single part previous games made great exchange clunky awful boring gameplay executive probably thought looked neat buy circumstances buy wolfenstein games great pretend one never existedupdate despite updates still terrible devs need start end new colussus pretend never made concept open world city new wolfenstein games raven softwares wolfenstein game also sealed areas could entered youngblood brings concept another level though immersive fascinating parallel universe finally enemies feel challenging ranking skills weapons becomes necessity course two blazkowicz girls fantastic characters really fun listening coop game style adding really cool flair entire game price really neat game worth playing core game okay coop shit dont really feel like play friend run like speed also hard stealth level take downs also cant understand cant take melle going invis weird anyways core game coop refund devs game really lack skill ibn following departments making satisfying gunplay making good story writing good characters implementing least basic customization optionsconclusion never let arcane close another wolfenstein game let skilled people machine games work next game thanks game enjoyable friend meant played however worth price wait sale drop half cost game could improved neary bad people claim loved entire nazis future thing past games still reason play girls talk little much expect young ladies age growing sisters havent finished game yet want game potential great like new colossus ruined players playing solo mess ai controlled character doesnt help makes game play much complicated solo playing enemy tanky kill due player rather single player player mode player coop mode separate would fantastic game game changed lot better still fun play friends lots content price game many flawsthe leveling system really unbalanced ai makes many mistakes think game lot good ideas ideas find good games cooperation level skill sneak scene mechanism everything mixed suck hell theres lot lighting glitches make like product rush deadlinebut however youre game developer gamer interest game design topics definitely would recommend play game negative lesson ill spend time deeper think bad game represented executed game coop shooter designed around promoted start bot option dont expect much story kind peppered bit think vermintide instead rat people youre killing nazi rat people play friend fully appreciate dont go expecting witcher level story telling goofy bmovie like shooter game beautiful honestly like childish banter two girls part fun adult life increasingly infuriated checkpoint gameplay mazelike maps cant save midmap actual quests make quest checkpoint get back metro station cant zoom minimap follow longdistant quest markers map see convoluted alleyways busted hallways travel get destinations maps like mazes hate games make maps mazes twentysomething could blow hours one day wandering around wondering jumping window crawling sewer pipe magic way go left follow quest marker minimap shows small area shows way go left maybe id like anymore enjoyed game less less play waste much time trying get one end otheranother timewasting feature markers show one active quest time even multiple quests one area could run right past something important another quest idea unless flip back forth active quests order see markers know makes sense due cutscenes dialogue ive already spent full minutes going stairwells circles jump one window jump tiny railing wander along forever climb another window find right one double back times go navigate basement circular stair maze crap kill ton surprise mobs spawn behind come back find another quest wants go exact area pick briefcase mobs respawned eff hour point frustration level game overreached fun dont think ill playing anymore game great fun killing nazis fluid satisfying issue lack save points missions im interested grinding hour im learning mechanics boss fight add checkpoint boss fight ffs game quite standards story wise used gunplay point various guns upgrades keep game entertaining complitionist type get hours tops lots going back old areas itit good game nothing write home game ok however dont like story line dose wolfenstein feel game play overall think bethsda could done better job game feels expansion game would recomend picking old blood getting wait till drops price game pretty frustrating played alone however mechanics game circumvent issues pretty fast understand ai behavior although wish ai would stop standing plain sight ruined stealth random online players even worsethe game legit smoothest fps experience ever new id tech engine game even managed push even frames previous id tech engine used doom wolfenstein new order also love twin sisters lot personality extremely likeable cutscenes though doesnt really justice found random dialogue missions better villain though blatantly obvious dumb isnt really focus story finding william terrorbilly doingi minor gripes like respawn weird times enemy literally spawned right face thin air wish also wasnt chore go hidden locations games quick traveling would much less hassle dont go killing enemies pricing pretty interesting pretty much game split people think worth price since enough replayability side missions daily challenges however interested play story please wait saleps upgrade ability throw tomahawks pretty much get rid fodders may except robots without firing shot also like play offline advise invest ability allows return extra health armor revived ai likely revive times likely fall lot nature respawn system game really awseome played wolfenstein games really like series gamesyou really buy game game really far short considered full release like add wolfenstien series okay addon left feeling like someone higher company wanted quick cash grab instead good continuation complete game game really fun friend blast tried getting next day unable invite idea absolutely videos fix im sure fixed would appreciate feedback game short pretty cool movement guns feel good boss fights pretty cool last boss kind pain game isnt badfor wolfenstein purists itll get lot hate common fps perspective youre basically getting full aaa game title half cost people also complain rather short main story line dont see problem like side missions well perk system mechanics easy understand customizing weapons funalso mentioned game short wellso old blood dont see people complaining however imy final verdict perfect got charm find fun refreshing change past wolfenstein seriesalso unpopular opinion dont find twins annoying dialogue kinda cute tbh game good get fact youre playing twin girl good market saturated slow movement slow gameplay based shooters boring youngblood good smooth fast movement mechanics sprinting strafing sliding jumping good mouse input well highsens players visual recoil bit annoying enemy visibility shooting also annoying barrel smoke clean fastpaced coop shooter like nice break tedious online pvp game goodi like story line recommend

repetitive characters interesting either also story mehits trying like far cry borderlands rather old bloodnew ordernew colossus cant reach level far cry borderlands seriesi rather play also recommend far cry borderlands series game bad wolfenstein game first one recent trilogy embraces old school design particularly balancing powerful weapons rare ammunition change massive gives much depth shooting exploration ties well combat strategy emulating back rtcw wolfenstein even older titles duke nukem arent given assault rifle good everything endless ammothe gunplay movement sense freedom level design best series ever experienced indeed pushing towards doom direction scripted gimmicks unlike new order many levels stripped one weapons force unskillful tedious mechanics force narrative eg submarine level surprise story also quite decent certainly better wolfenstein felt rushedmy complaints game forced coop mechanic playing really affect game much bar final boss fight understand game

badbarebones repetitive completely lacking made old blood new order great mention buggy play borderlands youll get better version fun times since coop game pretty fun game repetitive af fun nonetheless shooting sharp ever game seriously flawed needs way save games play hour get killed go back whole hourmore checkpoints maybecant recommend game shit make like wolfenstein ii burn ground game trash lol cant even single thing work coop tried mins succesi dont recommend game sooo underrated even better predecessors great rights really dont understand whining leveling system new enemy armorhealth bar system imo add welcome depth complexity still plenty easy rip hordes baddies gory abandon ive big wolfenstein head since kid cutting teeth original wolfenstein fpss spear destiny etc installment tops far really hope initial griping doesnt cause devs abandon progress theyve made game still great different wolfenstein games recommend play medium easy difficulty game harder previous games game unfortunately far removed superb previous entries machinegames bad game looks good potential good gameplay much muddled myriad factors reviews summed nicely better could short bullet points awaits youngblood coop focus even solo play play alongside ai companion pretty useless breaks stealth makes bossfights harder drawing fire getting killed revive companion otherwise start share lives small maps visit lot ton quite frankly boring side missions send back lot quickly becomes tedious even fight enemies side missions necessary game levelling system areas story missions need higher level also random side objectives also basic get repetitive soon exact one pop twice within minutes area feel like give perk points powerups etc thanks structure also respawning enemies bulletsponges btw specific armor effectively shot specific weaponry pausing manual saving checkpoints storyboss missions wipe boss youll restart whole level much reduced interaction character less focus story weak story overall many interesting characters begin main characters horrible people say banter pretty bad microtransactions course wouldnt modern video game withoutit really sad machinegames arkane venerable studios somehow managed deliver poor product far cry youd expect want wolfenstein title id recommend avoid one maybe try change things later date dont think possible turn one around without going deep core game systems structure story simply hope next entry series return singleplayer focused linear fps vein new order old blood note new collossus like game already mission structure hinted one areas could revisit sideops found boring already game unlike wolfenstein games essentially
