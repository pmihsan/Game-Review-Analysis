enough computer singleplayer good like wolfenstein multiplayer games good game definitely wolfenstein iii game created mixed feeling enjoy gameplay trying time feels friend thoroughly enjoying multiplayer campaign think enjoy much definitely see people dislike game would never buy play didnt multiplayer mode definitely wait sale overall game feels like extended dlc sorts starters sjw women power game room temp iq idiots think game fun point theres side missions outside main storyline dont really interest extra xp ability points main storyline however fairly interesting hours youve completed game definitely shows didnt really care game core part wolfenstein series constant coop interactions tedious enemies spawning front behind gets annoying longer play gun play alright different types armour enemies makes interesting way use one gun see annoyance looting constant collectables makes finding things pointless half game youre spamming e random things dont even end looking journal aside needing decode floppy disks tldr game bearable hours time take finish starters game denuvo drm bethesda respect customer need bethesdanet account absolutely reason completely dispel illusion game paid also sad attempt condition future bethesda games removed steam use shitty bethesdanet launcheras game unclear called wolfenstein remove name game nothing suggests kind relation wolfenstein anything id software ever done without wolfenstein name would think mediocre clone mediocre borderlands space nazis made someone like city interactive would look game twiceyou play insufferable cunts whose sole mission life annoy use weapons boring derivative form function make long precise tight responsive feel weapons wolfenstein design characters enemies mostly ugly especially armor helmets girls look like someone tried copy dead space understand made design work girls least cute sexy fun around way game could something im sure bethesda made girls ugly purpose leftist sjws likely nobody bethesda knows make aesthetically pleasing females humans general effort put making elizabeth great character great companion made bioshock infinite great effort made design plot gameplay mechanics second character standin bot human coop playerand cherry top shit sundae course microtransactions absolutely disgusting disrespectful conclusion nobody buy play game want coop replay gears war want shooter companion character play bioshock infinite want shooter rewards skill ability aim also one forcing rpg elements wolfenstein series likely worst combination ive seen entire life looking forward theyre going unfck next wolfenstein use crappy mechanicedit almost forgot good job adding microtransactions singleplayer game lmao series story driven intense action fps

computers entirely didnt get far really feel like shouldnt return fix major bugs intensely fun game brought back old blood days hope day continue fuck good game fun first gameplay gets repetetive characters also terrible living proof todays gaming industry focused forcing political agenda throats instead making good game fun co op focused loot shooter game exactly says box best people complaining expecting next wolf even though clearly labeled different go figure fun coop worth around hours play guns feel bit lacking price right fun first hours flaws quickly become apparent
