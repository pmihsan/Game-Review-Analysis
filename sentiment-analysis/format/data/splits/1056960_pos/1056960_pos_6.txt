william even characters introduced previous titles like anya max hell even side characters game feel weak underdeveloped dont remember anyones names catacombs honestly dont reason help protect seem like give missions example wolfenstein new order side characters seemed like main characters fleshed important plot actual emotions towards world events happening rather saying different lines giving mission two also villains werent bad predictable weak last boss far go series wont spoil anything annoying felt like game could went longer story leading fight pretty bare bones go three different districts find access three towers climb top large buildings fight recycled boss basically clones zerstor enemy almost done game happens awful sounds didnt affect much actually felt like got moneys worth game whereas feel like would felt worse payed deluxe say lot fun playing game especially since dollars deluxe basically gives copy friend play allow someone use whenever long play unlimited play withnow discussed disliked enjoy shooting movement felt good fast awesome like previous titles addition powers suits things like new weapons mechanics helped lot think downside cant dual wield weapon feel twins strong william guess customization done weapons also nice touch skins arent bad want change look every wish little cheaper oh let us forget new enemies like suicide bomber dog favorite enemy whole game hear bark boom seeing negative reviews im genuinely surprised enjoying game amazing graphics cutscenes really fun game play pal recommended sure solo ai friend looking fun coop shooter one gun nazis buds loot progress ive personally never gotten wolfenstein series im definitely looking forward playing older ones seems fun cant play minutes get motion sickness extreme head bobbing feel nauseous since option turn cannot recommend game seems good game play wise yeah story lack luster since wolfenstein games become story shooting nazis thats simple sometimes weird youre

microtransactions although thankfully arent aggressivenitpicks cant listen cassette tapes journal one wants sit menu listen combat takedowns great repetitive incombat knife takedowns called wolfenstein young blood yeah sounds kinda weird follows established naming format past games maybe thats point shit man dont know since rtx update game remains unplayable months intel rtx asus always game switches sceneries level fps drop reasons followed numerous guide fix problems didnt games like control also use dlss rtx work perfectly youngblood wont thanks nice rtx update however said beginning game becomes unplayable even disable rtx dlss function try play nothing slay nazis like theres tomorrow hours game opinion might little premature however feel must express far kind disappointment leveling characters enemies bummer route went unfortunate enemies feel like total bullet sponges game wants grind level character like level determines much damage bullet enemies

upgrade character customize weapons better fit play style something keeps pulling back despite somewhat boring quests level design solid reminds lot dishonored game enjoyed tremendously although incredibly annoying clear area leave minutes come back filled enemies really needs longer cooldown period inbetween spawns biggest grip one biggest features game forced play someone ai partner youre
