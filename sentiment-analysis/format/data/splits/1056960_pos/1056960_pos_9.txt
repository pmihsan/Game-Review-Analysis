wolfenstein game made first boss willing play arkane studios pls gtfo franchise game looks like prey wolf setting would surprised first would fun later would rate meh love wolfenstein one like new

standard game didnt bring much oh damn youngblood chore nowhere fun kinda stucked refunding keep playing finish one damn day never ever remember id ever finish game ill make sure updating review probably remain negative though game bad honestly mediocre average hybrid shooter maybe subpar game remember fucking wolfenstein seemingly tried bring something new shouldnt supposed like rpg elements dont go well wolfenstein new colossus didnt shake much loved game chore dont want keep repeating please remember game choreenemies bullet sponge bet would heard like times already yeah thats truth immortal nowhere hard point level played mins sister ai dumb find playing gunblazing mode stealth kinda unbearable still hard get used enemies fucking health bars outleveled fuck great cant even enjoy

destiny dont get didnt create solid coop fps shooter would easy dont think hell cares fun state youngblood isnt anywhere joyful really funny level receive permanent damage permanent damage give fuck damn mathematics another problem level desgin managed great large levels totally empty except damn silver coins nope hunt coins wolfenstein game since enemies bullet sponge based levels logical fill map bunch enemies fucking shared lives sister revive miliseconds good thing obviously cant revive fast go gunblaze style thing await good gangbang though havent restarted level bc still playing game fear damages experience one damned thing hub bunch missions set certain levels like fuck also learned finished main mission go catacombs via menu hard way ive played map minutes completed bunch stupid side objectives thought nope didnt grinding crushing game bc main chars love female protagonists also swearing everyone personally loved games like wolfenstein dishonored deus ex md south park fractured whole reviewed mixed problems quite enjoyable shit feel really sorry stuff optimization issue oddly cutscenes locked fps looks worse ingame ingame graphics similar new colossus mean course get fps uber graphs via main characters likeable dont really think wont bj bj quite deep character fps game also look charismatic doesnt look good cutscenes idk game doesnt pause menu lost lifes welp lucky enought sis ai clear enemies know hard trust ai nowadays also need adress currently players completed mission coop tbh want pick friend almost enjoy anything doesnt youngblood game deserve quick maybe split money friend buy deluxe version wont able write coop simply dont anyone play feelsbadman youngblood kind multiplaying expansion new colossus somethings youll feel uncomfortable mostly related multiplay oriented changeswhy play solo conclude thiss fall wolfenstein seriesybs even wolfenstein iii nearly based new colossus im playing game solo coop didnt go smoothly first glace feel completely ok random matching highly recommend youre truly fan new colossus new orderand ever dreamed playing games friends must try game youngblood mix machine games arkane studios known single player experiences different approach storytelling view speculation choices makes game likely appeal spoiler everyonemachine games known new series wolfenstein true fans heritage old blood love letter fans return castle wolfenstein possibly favourite franchise machine games focused cutscenes bring characters life interesting internal monologues scripted levels allow diverse approach stealth going loud proud hub inbetween missions allow character growth player interaction side charactersarkane hand known dishonoured series approaching story telling different direction like sandboxes giving player tools explore experience story part eyes players chosen protagonist missions separated hub side missions accepted next story mission sandbox usually missed cannot go backthe similarities established machine game formula dishonoured arkane recipe choice approach stealth manage worlds lore character players character growth motivations youngblood built two different foundations similar drives wolfenstein fan machine games indeed past entries open sandbox clashing past well crafted mazes puzzles used however think enjoyed wolfenstein raven software know one games time likes forget yet enjoyed one think youngblood appeal search chase objectives paris time rather isenstadton paper freedom explore sounds great practice expected wolfenstein franchise clever crafted labyrinths secrets find hand feels like poor level design however poorly implemented different approach fails due lack player motivation care environment dishonored every side mission main mission impact hub world grows making choice missions rewarding wolfenstein youngblood seems samey enemies respawn place npcs tell good happening efforts besides lifeless ones hub catacombs streets never really change get side missions alternative ways start raids brother towers many side missions poorly labelled ui choose active whats near inevitably go back hub catacombs sent wolfenstein youngblood takes new approach gameplay well ingesting rpg elements requiring player take note previous wolfenstein games series perks awarded chosen playstyle achieving challenges almost naturally abilities unlock skill points earn levelling certain missions abilities split three sections mind muscle power mind focus health recovery exploration muscle armour dual wielding heavy weapon options power three choices one locked till later ram cloak allowing improved bonuses either run gun stealth play stylesthis allows new protagonists novices feel different dad dual wielding pistols heavy weapons makes girls feel somewhat behind bj strength however sisters carry heavy weapons right ability choices making e question bj always threw away yes level gating thing includes choice abilities sections map enemy always high level rather scaling deter rushing main story missions grind feel awful quite quick level side missions dont feel rewarding progressing story makes feel needless padding interesting think concession allow coop drop partners never feel behind story guns also take advantage new rpg side things weapon mastery boosts damage getting many kills upgrades guns section choice parts different brands three brand gain brand bonus parts give extra tools torch dark areas rifle torch stops dual wielding limits pistol weapon top gun ammo every ammo bonus one two different armour types hollow

reasonably starting choice effects starting weapons sister unlocked upgrade alreadyyou get rest enough money upgrades tutorial mission making almost mute mention sisters handle play missed opportunity personally give freedom players choose customise sisters play style eventually jack trades double jump begin making game vertical interesting main selling point coop fun partner ai many bugs difficulties medium hindrance rather help coop features like double locks awkward code reading forced keep guys together best thing staying close though emotes yes said emotes actually things boosting armour health full revives partner make nice addition allow get quirky silliness sisters max three lives share dont bleed help otherwise life lost reloads area loose ammo checkpoint originally making increasingly harder emotes great keep eye one equipped time set partner benefit one anotherthe story story play story play gun playthis poor wolfenstein game story level design two factors machine games known making lot negative feeling towards game valid however fun dumb shooter light rpg elements enjoy buddy wolfenstein universe machine games created microtransactions exist game shouldnt hereso overall youngblood standalone expansion like tob except far experimental theres coop leveling hubs sidemissions much greater emphasis replayability played game solo enjoyed coop isnt mandatory leveling controversial mostly nonissue quickly hubs fun explore reminded bit dishonored sidemissions pretty halfassed theres lot gaas stuff like daily weekly challenges story character development minimal writing definitely less poignant last gamesnone stuff really matters though core gameplay rock solid addition doublejump gives far mobility previous games new wonderfully op weapons kill really fun run around kill stuff everything else icing cake said couple things didnt like dualwielding restricted onehanded weapons making far less satisfying addition secondary firing modes gone means dualwielded rocket launchers flak cannons annoyed lot first started playing got pretty quicklyultimately enjoyment youngblood depends priorities enjoy previous games surprisingly good writing cinematic moments wont like youngblood enjoy previous games gameplay like youngblood youngblood fantastic originally bought game love franchise wanted something new play borderlands released next month idea would good ive played solo far blast youngblood like metroid wolfenstein perfectly playable solo fairly challenging interesting story previous weapons back available use well unique abilities perks based suits eight hours done lot side missions one larger main missions estimate game could around hours gameplay depending much like whether go online completiondespite hyperbolic people plays decent loop would compare gunplay destiny borderlands leveling matters far people hit wall completely ignore side objectives try mainline story runs fairly well mid high settings gf megs ram processor youngblood different typical wolfenstein game could see acquired taste fun like rpg style shooters like borderlands youngblood isnt like tno tob tnc coop focused game thatll going back levels complete different missions dont go expecting like others thats say completely differentthe overall gunplay gameplay feel much like games visuals like nicer rtx soundtrack still great theres also decent story cutscenes similar quality main real difference progression replay levels multiple times different objectives order level game definitely made youll reply things need earn silver unlock level parts weapons far feels like youll need grind want unlock everythingoverall still great wolfenstein game highly recommend playing friend im sure theyve changed since launch game isnt grindfest thought would enemies much bullet sponge expecting either although entire experience coop faralso youre weary characters like reviews dont theyre perfectly fine likeable albeit little cheesy expect dont take away game youngblood takes winning mechanics previous game throws window replaces bulletsponge enemies bland protagonists youngbloods premise one ideas must easy get stakeholders buy
