buy im noticing lot downvotes game seems sort expectations preconceptions game experiencing technical difficulties game far lot funfirst im blast literally nazi body parts everywhere first expectation metsecond heavy weapons mean doesnt like using lasers literally melt nazis unexpected expectation metthird melee stealth kills hatchetwin im fence recommending game ultimately decided give thumbs rare coming age story led almost exclusively female charactersyoull like game view primarily arkane studios given wolfenstein assets something powerful story based games new order new colossusthe story also whereas bj contemplative full trauma unpack jessie sophia two dorky teens coming age journey bj would internal monologue elevator daughters would sass prank otherif want arcadey shooter massacring nazis game great expecting good good nonc storytelling well sorry im going give game thumbs due coop side play friend id strongly go game looking play dont even bother trying play many said youll deal horrible ai companion cant play either friend ai companion go game togetherthe sisters game beyond joke act like little kids theres quite bit cringe acting espically elevator speaking elevators pretty annoying open every single elevator friend want go somewhere else progress game graphics wolfenstein youngblood average honesty im running game maxed nothing impressive honestly looks like video game terms graphicsenemies arent exactly smart killed ease comes killing youll feel like youre shooting sponge amount bullets absorb finally diegame play wise pretty solid games well done nice upgrades tweak around weapon see fit purchased coins collect earn game either environment killing enemies finishing missions ill cut youll enjoy game play friend otherwise id recommend giving pass ive enjoyed since played mate thats reason im giving thumbs im interested narrative driven singleplayer games older gamer loved previous entries wolfenstein series despite red flag bethesda repurposing traditionally singleplayer game cooperatively focused thought id give try understand theyve gone business direction potential monetisation live service model blah blah shouldve cautioned trying youve played fallout appreciate direction bethesda taking franchises going forward bottom line nothing like previous entries would dissuade anyone thinking trying expecting ill much cautious sequel future im playing lowest difficulty correct level using fully upgraded shotgun right face one super soldiers yet takes like shots face kill guyit really quite easy easy difficulty youre basically invincible wheres fun shooting guy face entire minute doesnt even take damage im pleasantly surprised like new order new colossus however enjoyable fps like homefront revolution far prettier smoother lot fun im pretty sure wondering wolfenstein youngblood worth time think game wolfenstein old blood main meaty game like wolfenstein new order wolfenstein new colossus rather opposite side coinstory wise wolfenstein new colossus ended anya twins two girls fast forwarded around years later girls grown young adults taught life bj anya know defend hunt survive harsh world nazis still threat even hitlers deathblazko blazko one man army goes disappears weird crusade leaving anya girls alone girls worry dad curious vanished go mission find course without asking anyone permission thats basically story plot twists lot nazi killing well usual wolfensteini jumped expecting wolfenstein shooter minimal story nothing crazy basically like wolfenstein games dont need complicated plot games like main aspect shooting nazis beat story took roughly hours easy difficulty still collectibles find side missions try coop might spend moredifficulty isnt braindead rather nice even easy fights challenging enough seek cover actively search supplies ammo tend run go guns blazing ai smart smaller enemies move lot take cover fun fight larger enemies tend attack usually high armor health need bit strategy beatenemy variety great similar previous wolfenstein games new ones well different armor types enemies interesting idea requiring pick correct weapon type defeat themgame leveling system unlockable perks abilities weapon upgrades battle suits cosmetics every weapon level kill enemies increase damage additionally upgrades missions often reward ability points find minicurrency coins city spend upgrades didnt notice anything wrong microtransactions dont use unlocked wanted freely see issue whatsoevergame isnt really grindy nice balance enemy respawn revisiting locations doesnt get old always busy shooting stuff usually progress areas locked need specific tools enter tend visit later time collectibles lootlittle bit main characters aka sisters game set alternate universe compared much science fiction around keep mind sisters pretty much teens raised boy like girl intensive combat training usually talk like teenage dudes yes nose slang cringe roof remember teenage years werent much different personally didnt issue teens act fool dont make serious basically prepared small age protect also notice mature character story goes closer endenvironments look great similar previous games runs well recommended specs overall well optimized lot detail clutter around city rewarding explore every alley balcony loot collectibles even pick perk help find said collectibles problemsthrowing weapons powerful care level upgrade would advise invest early tend kill almost everything supersoldaten one hit otherwise standard health armor upgrades power suit abilitiesstealth play also thing useful cloaking ability things cant kill silently bigger robots drones might wrong think stealth kills reward experience currency dont quote didnt keep eye numbersother gameplay similar older games weapons satisfying shoot though enemies tend large amounts armor need rip dual wielding thing heavy weapons occasional dismemberment gore melee stealth take downs moreblazko game isnt playable rather sticks cutscenes base hub pick missions talk people similar submarine time catacombs friendly face see city sister ai coop buddy occasional prisoners savebesides main mission side missions also pick daily weekly challenges replay story missions really want also jump someones game quick match help another player create validate bethesda account add friend play friend steam matchmaking wont otherwise workto honest even liked previous games serious story heavy rather fun enjoyable shooter play friend two female protagonists rather rare days wonder female gamers think title leave comment im genuinely curious case fun gameenjoy im sorry heck devs thinking health bars braindead ai companion makes daikatanas look like elizabeth bioshock infinite play solo rpg mechanics wolfenstein waited year come machinegames better horseshit ive always enjoyed wolfenstein games ive enjoying one different games sure fact distinct destiny vibe fps rpg elements need loot lot well grind way missions get ahead visit various areas nazioccupied paris complete missions return base go area different mission feel bit grindy times especially many areas feature nazis respawned loot upgrading gear weaponry skills allows find new ways pound nazis open new areas individual locations go highlight certainly coop mode dont even need game one person bought deluxe edition game play entire thing free coop mode need download demo get invite graphically visually youngblood stunning close quarters combat brutal entertaining variety baddies certainly makes things interesting certain design choices bit odd silencers example feel kind pointless heavily armoured enemies take masses bullets take everyone aware presence reload throwable knives axes apparently damage guns stealth kills effective way deal enemies rarely clear room way played fair bit without coop player found ai actually really good ruining stealth rescuing get trouble far good killing nazis always fun ive playing wolfenstein since beginning alls say love ive enjoyed thus far brother gifted id certainly wait sale sort agree negative reviews make great point still fun game coop good singeplayer game imo ive enjoyed
