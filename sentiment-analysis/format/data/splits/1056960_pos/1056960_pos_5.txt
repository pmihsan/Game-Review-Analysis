disappointing enjoy series buy sale play main story missions figure want keep going side questsa different take wolfenstein game best parts series like graphics weapons level design action bad ass enemies main changes game brings islinear design openish world designgreat scripted story mediocre main story side missionsthe story aspect definitely let game greater replay value due side missions dailyweekly challengesthe biggest downside game feels like half way buddy game looter shooter focused team looter shooter aka destiny ever liked wolfenstein least friendyou enjoy one worth sale expect good story look elsewhere one games get experience storyif looking story however expect annoying character choices plot armor could outfit bismarkthe aspects game good though gun customization though fallout im saying thats good bad though feels smooth leveling fun much chore originally thought atmosphere game shines really astounding settings sometimes get sucked gamethe game suffers many bugs however able connect friends frequent crashes aware thinking getting game also game unplayable singleplayer make sure bring friend along rather bland impossible experience rtx ti game worth buying

silver coins actual fps mechanics good albeit overlaid rpg hud elements cant turn offi really really wish steam meh recommendation option im going go one unless youre total wolfenstein junky case probably pick sale updateso bethesda apparently gotten tired perpetually known bugthesda encouraged developers make gameplay changes based player feedback rather claiming players dont understand game recent patches fact addressed biggest concern game boss fights solo longer suckunfortunately improvements sister ai anything sure doesnt randomly pot enemies im stealthed wanders side map gets stuck sighi might convinced offer tepid yes game sale id think long hard otherwise solid wolfenstein dash dishonored dose doom really fun coop game okay single player game coop chaotic frenetic reminds doom always moving playing aggressive extremely satisfying stealth doesnt work well coop unless chatting partner single player less satisfying still works reasonably well lacks highs coop mission design little repetitive three brothers largely similar experiences side missions also seem little repetitive side graphically game nice level design ia huge plus game thats youll notice dishonored influence sound issues mostly stuttering cutting happens occasionally although nothing imagine cannot patched overall id rate buy anyone wants fun coop romp game doesnt strong narrative last two wolfenstein games enjoyment largely determined whether like coop enjoy fast paced shooter different kind wolfenstein stil real cool game play fun game amazing shoot things game loved explore environment uncover story wolfenstein eu game thought got bought relax shot much want wondering people gets views negative games youtube fun game friends play otherwise ai quite stupid game fast paced intense world rich

andor city meaning youll visit location multiple times good locations game fun blazkowicz fine protags editi want clarify im playing solo ai controlling sister idea coop another player good bad called wolfenstein somehow doesnt feel like wolfenstein worth sale though decent youre big fan series worth checking youre new series check one way better titles like new order old blood guns pretty harsh random bullet deviation doesnt feel good times level design decent game play wise feels reused uninspiring minus last couple levels boss fight one makes happy sisters quirky find refreshing see non model personalities keeps little interesting think leveling system could big changes mostly serve gate harm goodanyone tries say looter shooter beyond wrong thing resembles one leveling system iv seen others beat game hours time diluted meaningful uninstalled wards would call renter pc thats thing buy discrepancy fine fun fun kill nazis friends fun people love complain fun like fun things literally matters game good full price buy want fun enjoy interesting story good solid coop fun concerned well tuned fps action modern wolfensteins disappointed one word warning respect learn armor effectiveness works big hurdle lot players simply put try one player either armor type smooth sailing story definitely weak feel something structure coop game encouraging matchmaking strangers want keep story line consistent players something dont know point isnt well paced engaging single player wolfensteins two sisters also pretty obnoxious enjoy suffering think theyre fine easy see would bother people compared billys serious tone game also uses recycles lot content makes missions almost completely disposable go room kill enemies finish objective leave never much however someone rarely plays games narrative obviously enjoy one makes watch long cutsceneswolfenstein youngblood strange entry wolfenstein franchise one goes almost everything modern single players flourish really caught lot people guard isolation however think game lot well big experiment single player game could cohesive coop experience ever changing partnersit stands solid foundation modern wolfenstein combat great laugh good friend despite honest flaws buddy pass fucking worked great alot people salty exactly older oncesits wolfenstein kill nazis weapons recent titles get friend half price recent wolfenstein games win bookwith said like wolfenstein friend question game get fun like destiny poor mediocrethats dont recommend looter shooter elements rpglite elements already existed games perfected change

replay value fails make fun process people dont like game one simple reason wolfenstein game core paint oneat least dont wait multiple minutes cutscenes finally get minutes shoot bad guys fun lot people let first im enjoying though many options upgrades kind confuse times recommend wolfenstein game looking one disappointedstory great might worth thought able pause game great idea good game story pretty bland sidemissions everything connectivity kept dropping partner mid mission lan connection mind good internet giving shittist ai partner ive ever legit wouldnt even sneak sneaking obviously little thought make game work however suddenly much thought even smallest details comes everything looks touch pads even smears oils fingers could play coop game without dripping multiple times session got wolfenstein bundle would never bought piece shit story driven got used great franchise however combat exactly expect apart level stuffif play coop lot fun wait good discount regret like new order new collossus nice game rpg elements main story killing nazis much gore nothing like bj could gives big info wolfenstein world left maybe good intro next last wolfenstein best game series still totally worth playing nowhere near bad people portray flaws played revisiting pcthe shooting maiming mechanics still fun ever game adds little formula great people criticise removal dual wielding mechanic large weapons fail see year old serious combat experience rambo style hold two massive automatic shotguns like dad supersoldaten body would shooting nazis always funthe sound design amazing love powerful guns sound even small ones really adds feeling badassery game fails two big fronts story progression minor spoilers aheadmy main gripe america liberated great playing game isnt game recovering america nazi rule sending back europe destroying checkpoints sabotage implementation new government etc instead get title card liberated america oh cool must fun guessfor reason game series killing nazis topic become less less relevant nazi killing become platform launch family drama story another level dont get wrong think really important family tension helps ground story create consequence bjs actions side aspect story want delve deep lore main aspect gamethe twins arent annoying people paint think internet sometimes get issue character wont let go even almost nothing base humor crude times misplaced genuinely funny heartfelt moments game think actresses played good part silly southern teenagers people calling annoying think teenager think less annoying unfunny well werent finally monetization game microtransaction exclusive skins beyond think shows bethesdas continuos desperation squeezing much money possible gamers tanking reputation release battlepasses coins gold bars sad reallyanyway buy add lore experience nice nazi killin thats peace pretty astounding cringingly written game supposedly playtesters somewhat fun friend bugs annoying id probably play

games rpg elements taking cover important bit harder specially beginning really fun still wolfenstein bratty twins tiny bit annoying yesbut still fun shooter repeating maps annoy people one mission every map plenty fine respawning enemies sometimes annoying shoot upnot yet still fun sale even would work fun rpg shooter fans gunplay isstill great wolfensteins lets start positive aspects game graphics look okayish ultra decent framerates ultra negative log bethesda account learn use steam api almost two minutes unskippable banners game starts ugly menu looks like year olds first unity game menu incredibly unintuitive took minutes figure start campaign main characters look like ripped game cinematics capped wtf screen tearing despite vsync shadows look stripey diagonal lines outofthebox graphics settings garbage see next point example game defaulted monitor full hd something like fun navigating menu blindly blurring interpolation game whole excessive political correctness diverstiy vibe yucks main characters act like pubescent teens really cringy watch cutscene lot long main characters feels like movie really really bad acting whole game feels polished rasp surprisei got game sale still going return even worth lets keep mind full price game story play one daughters bj along sister try find bj overthrow nazis paris help french resistance take headquarters get labx believe bj plot fairly transparent really isnt much terms narration character building build last games kind set rest games series though theyve foreshadowing certain plot elements awhile come fruition annoying though given brief treatment look forward see story goes bj daughters focus moving forward characters characters im mostly going focus daughters friend abby daughter grace wolfenstein ii shadow colossus much less serious juvenile comparison bj sets much lighter tone game overall see development beginning kill first nazi remain incredible static characters abby fairly static well backup tech person sisters think theres lot room characters go hope theyre developed graphics sound graphics good much else say couldnt run max fairly good looking game although nothing impressive environment wise music sound solid immersive like ive come know wolfenstein game nothing revolutionary solid gameplay alright heres thing try way much ends sorta nothing added lvs abilities game unlike theyve also added semi open world roam around inside diff areas various undergrounds also quite side quests semi open areas really tried mix rpg elements fps elements dont think game justice come play wolfenstein im looking awesome story driven linear fps game dont get wrong gunplay stellar always satisfaction killing nazis entirely enemies health bars much tankier world one shot headshots much customization weapons bonuses using weapons none customizations really impacted strength noticeable way enemies mostly still bullet sponges combat became less fluid snappy ended playing game medium higher difficulties enemies far tanky fun abilities decent also never felt like changed gameplay much throwing weapons super strong fun though ill give think gone rpg elements fps elements im alright wolfenstein changing identity want game ends good said however gave games go rpg elements depth satisfying overall impression decent shooter quite live previous games wasnt quite able pick direction ended making overall game weaker still enjoyed enough finish game long game little inclination many side quests decent game get sale still fun moments little bit setup future wolfenstein games like rage cant recommend graphics n stuff look good crashes time cant say good bad like coop maps open ended freedom exploration synthpop covers popular bands levels verticality previous games allowing optional flanking routes certain objectives use perks keep heavy weapons ability remove mounted guns mounts removed game balance guess deluxe version lets invite friends dont game want try outdislike story feels like written radical feminist maps open ended quite walk one end level another damagegated certain weapons ineffective certain types enemy armor levelgated certain enemies certain parts game certain level usually higher forces either sneak past find secret bypass underground unless final boss youre level time fight expect die several times even normal difficulty bj blazkowicz reduced almost husk former self showing climax exposition dont even see taking nazis spectacular fashion everything overshadowed daughters although cheaper previous games half content halved well dont count time spent side quests level character farming currency upgrade weapons deal tougher enemies would amount barely hour two finish main quests guess alternate culture dialogues interactions main characters cringy point entire script feels forced companion ai smart enemy smart ai wolfenstein first doom microtransactions presentwould recommend buying full price wait til discount least long story short wolfenstein meets borderlandsnot sure good idea previous wolfenstein games always great main characters honestly teenage blaskowicz girls strong single player story aimed gameplay quaziopen world repetetive grinding doesnt work well result weakest installment new era wolfenstein games kept playing sake knowing story ends ok killing nazis still fun need level first improve weapons would recommend buy im replaying get remaining achievements collectibles used previus machine games wolfenstein games longtime wasnt annoyed video game love wolfenstein
