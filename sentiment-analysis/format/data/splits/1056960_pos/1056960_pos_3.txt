machinegames something like destiny anthem division hope helped make choice beat game hardest difficulty want die bought game intensions would co op single player umm wtf story line starts good play well like wolfenstine games yb well expected better troops da faq seems like quick game put together say things suck donkey balls game like previous wolfenstine games put half hour graphics ok really guys yall throw shit together call game huge fan wolfenstine respect artist cmon guys play later gotten deep game yet write another review experance person wrote pros cons pros good graphics blood gore weapon sounds amazing smooth launch game performance decent level designs average campaign lengthcons unable pause game dualwielding except handgun machinepistol somehow melee attack effective

issues might good game play evers loads correctlysince wont load say recommend since play see bethesda going game want us side nazis cant say much game played hour played garbage hour horrible worth playing maybe little spending dollars game playing new wolfenstine games joke would rather play though others means game bust mention overwhelming amount others leaving reviews saying game crashing might play longer cannot good faith recommend game atleast full price even friend play played start finish friend cant comment companion ai completed game togetherthat said best game youre somewhat efficient quests whatnot even amazing still bad terms value opinion game short still microtransactions doesnt affect personally blankly ignore part game however still scummy really find positive game gunplay overall feels fairly good time short cant recommend full price heavy sale sure got friend play cannot recommend game anyone looking actual wolfenstein game open world loot shooter mechanics rpg elements added bad idea imo hard even call wolfenstein game tried refund almost hours playing learn cant refund hours play learned lesson today lol couldnt hours game missed every mark set previous titles much loved game seems none charm gate story jumps around erratically twins shy instagram influencer obnoxious nothing like would expect blazkowicz household combat alien none quests seemed make sense graphics look like fell old blood good title time nothing compared new colossusif love microtransactions leveling constant stream ui elements loot hunting high fives main characters act like teenagers discovered cuss words game love wolfenstein maybe save silver coins enjoy bit boring beginning much harder lvl upgrade gear etc becomes tiny bit easyer still easy finish game must say like lot still make game good enough enjoy game update caused lose save progress didnt like game beginning recent patch playing hrs think best wolfenstein date patch made nice difference single player like save points loot also set difficulty level casual regular hard casual may touch easy game like predecessors sandbox game linear expected new different format experience wolfenstein evolve die good game like playing people single mode good graphics great like looking sister would better self still great dont even know begin one game fun play good representation machine games wolfenstein series everything made wolfenstein games fun ie single player progression ability choose approach certain situations needing put bullets nazi kill etc completely devoid instead arkane machine games opted new formula game play consists apparent convoluted confusing rendition looter shooter lite rpg doesnt work series ultimately makes game feel like wasnt originally intended wolfenstein game reskinned piggy back successful franchise paper two player coop wolfenstein game sounds like great idea shouldnt main focus gameit shouldve optional feature whereas original linear game play mechanics progression remained intact feels though developers heads vision wanted game ultimately unable achieve whatever going bad game cant mad developers wanting try something new especially known making rpgs looter shooters rather linear single player stories understanding somewhat passion project respect however unless things game get seriously overhauled namely enemy nerfs playing alone ability play game single player without ai cant recommend anyone buy game even hardcore wolfenstein fans like dont get hate game ruff start yes good fun play didnt encounter bugs great coop game friend dont ai fixed ok actually useful sneak stays back doesnt raise alarms lvl system fine long play missions order use right weapons end game treasure hunt came across enemy ridiculous amount hp gameplay fell like wolfenstein characters stupid yes didnt bother easy ignore saying u focus killing stuffthere another negative thing tho length game really short u finish everything side quests add ons find collectibles beside great game dont know say get game turned one favorite franchises h lets see hell yeah dudethere pause buttonthere respawn enemies area like second agothere arent enough bullets kill enemiesthere zero sense ai controlled companion revive call providing health armor deadthere storythere nothing side missions wait side missions random things given new assignments completethese happened first four hours gameplay prepared see new cr next hours think enough turn people dont buy game unless want feel sweet ss regretedit microtransaction dont leave critical reviews often feel like part duty add list herewolfenstein youngblood installment series however feel attached two original stories say gameplay greatly differs first two games playing series together row game seem jarring abrupt changethis installment heavily implements arcadestyle like approach enemies combat enemies health bars leveling system quite literally prevent blasting game game easily beatable within hoursb please keep mind purchasing game unless like level characters weapons max level reason even hours game crashed randomly twice save file became corrupt gave choice start clean slate twicei honestly gave game chance however writing story weak unfortunate develop attachments characters world exist within previous installations kinda destroy bjs character world one hopeful save series within next installation series dont like multiplayer games one play ai stupid liked every wolfestain far also liked changes making like rpg customizable guns dont understand many people negative experience game absolutely loved story line good changes game new order enjoyable loved back forth two twins thought setup interesting future franchise played coop yetlooking forward dont know negativity coming game style wolfenstein coop good sound nice impact weapons pretty good level map design certainly worth enjoy positives personally like healthbars like use different ammunition get certain enemies armor makes sense like humorous bit less scary love amusing ai companion adds humor think hub travel back nice makes seem like actually rebels trying take back city bit time also think good kraftwork weapons instead choosing lastly think nice play female game thisnegatives dont like borderlands level bullet sponge levels health bullet sponge different ammunition taking time get certain parts enemy armor till fall yes thats fine mags grunts bare head hes levels higher reallyi get essentially test seeing wolfenstein think take continue shouldnt continued doesnt fit theme hope wolfenstein isnt end series though seems like starting look new things put series questionable others lovely think thats something people forgetting complaining games rpg elements introduce really awesome new things wellyou tell major games game though enjoy game enjoy game done one wolfenstein series way back ultimate baddass retrun wolfenstein castle master piece play still play couple times year start finish never gets old wolfenstein say sensational times begining something awesome come knew havent disappointed yet one sort sucked thats okay everyone allowed least mulligan got cyberpilotvr blast wolfenstein hand developrs kept thyme right tee relate exact fears laughter awa wha wahthe elite guard never dull moment game thing humor usual action packed need use brain little good done far giving complaint right cant keep enough ammo get tough times learn learning strategy combat scenios challaning like others exactly cup tea dock um half point making work hard dont know lazy enjoyed playing youngblood found pretty good funny liked new approach weapon system rpg element must say story seems shorter previous games doesnt make bad opinion story ending potential problem story canon missions ended feeling last mission missions bit boring wait play bj wolfenstein enjoyed playing game pretty much wolfenstein collection played entire thing solo one issue ai elevator rode elevator back back able continue liked story player progression weapon leveling pause solo wasnt really big issue still would nice game currency option pay interfere game play mainly purchasing skins faster wanted think melee weapon could purchased currency good game enjoyed game lot possibly also finally able get swastikas everything else legal germany without download modsthe game ist quite fun whole load different weapons combined bunch skillsi dont like listening people im giving opinion really like game exclusively play friend great cracks us time personally love interactions twins together expected wolfenstein experience added benefit friend tagging along experience hour campaign characters grow love cutscenes draw story choices weigh heavily experiencethe trailers made us expect typical still exciting experience one gotten new order old blood new colossus nothing trailers highlighted would playing claustrophobic map grinding level high enough kill handful enemies disallowed progression high level us best experience boring repetitive major disappointment togetheri played game almost hours amount time would taken beat ones felt like made next progress yeah could played longer period time played game long would taken beat one onesif recall new colossus decodable intel strips got killing officers normal campaign could take back sub use find location important nazi figures could kill side missions entire game thats felt like one large side mission fiasco first level except isnt optional even side missions nc better levels still unique fun blast throughi love games probably go back play future mood strikes even old blood short story somewhat lacking amount gameplay runs circles around titleim downright disappointed cant even argued title cost half much others shouldnt expected type content old blood cost aside somewhat short still fun game good progression story cared borderlands done badlyand care story watch cutscene movie youtube youll get experience little get new colossus little half new order gave us least dont grind achieve watch twins mess around elevator loading screen involves one finished game yesterday singleplayer think generally good gamepros good shooting movement feeling nice upgradable movement actions like fast sidestrafing upgradable weapon options like environments although bit similar times interesting coop revive option daily weekly missionscons short good story previous games series ai companion coop could improved dialogues unnecessary politicalsuggestions improvements ai crouch without becoming

dont understand pause feature better safe place need bathroom break occursif f sister got injured image showing location always factual makes big battles tough cant trust need go assist team mateif series fan like play know different wolfenstein single player experiences youve never played wolfenstein id recommend new order colossus first fun experience coop great time playing game obviously meant cooperative play designed around however played entire game single player playing coop honestly say really dont see everyone angry feel many fans comparing game previous games flawed comparison previous wolfenstein games primarily story driven single player big budget aaa games youngblood next sequel wolfenstein series lets get way minimal story cut scenes sold half price new colossus game offers something like borderlands destiny looter shooter cooperative experience without loot better shooting better environments realistic level scaling system youngblood well shooting gritty mix cover shooting push forward combat even better especially friend really blend two styles first ai pretty great choose play solo sisters ai competent zero moments dumb ai either enemies would stuck supposed annoying ai sister flank less tries stay close sadly doesnt take advantage great environments makes boss battles significantly challenging far dumb use pep signals well come save call go definitely holds enemy ai also competent never experienced moments ai would shake head always moved acted varied still fairly predictable way exactly want ai nazis second leveling system actually enjoyed personally hate leveling systems fps games experience hardcore leveling difficulty issues exception one time early clearly tried enter area meant later game also really like leveling system never felt phony like every rpg make weak looking enemies complete bullet sponges reason enemies level become tougher show wearing significantly armor gear higher levels tiers never feels fake enemies complete bullet sponges instead always die reasonable number shots third environments completely top notch visually fun play well crafted every area seems multiple routes either player go leftright highlow perfectly suited cooperative shooting arenas amazing play incredibly detailed perhaps beautiful realistic environments seen online game comparable graphics would expect see single player campaign graphics shy detail new colossus gripe levels simply enough enough different environment types finally shooting absolutely amazing sure borderlands better loot billion guns shoot honestly none guns feel satisfying enjoyed shooting new order new colossus love shooting able play cooperatively priceless wolfenstein mix sneaking cover shooting balls push forward combat done perfectly allowing players filling role respectively honestly preferred shooting shooting new colossus many times new colossus switch cover firing dual shotgun charging often quickly survive effectively whereas one player focus upgrade one direction allowing player focus good end would definitely recommend game worth money many times feel negative reviews simply kids false expectations would expect experience would expect great single player campaign story cut scenes cooperative online shooter feel many negative reviews prefer apples new order new colossus orange youngblood failing entirely appreciate differences high hopes game really enjoyed others franchise disappointed story awful game play games leveling horrible get game bucks maybe worth otherwise refund like fact turned open world wish linear minutes playtime play nothing good say titlei rooting bad guys win feel like made people last wolfenstein games top line pc constantly crashes get game hours game alright inspected thought option play coop single player nope coop host join game progress buddy pass impressed absolutely idea game got poor reviews could give thousand positive reviews would pros cons like game significant wolfenstein feel chemistry relationship two blazkowicz twins endearing downright cute times still tenacious dedication stopping nazis like fatherboth twins similar character contrasts similarities bj good job portraying similarities two girls fatherone complaints ive heard game enemies bullet sponges game didnt play smoothly problem game fps titles ive played difficult enemies take abuse lower difficulty enemies go paths progression level weapons upgrade well leveling upgrading character nonissueif looking mindless give everything need ill go around killing everything fps granted game looking game involved fun play definitely game youi could go feel title huge fan direction taken story two twins purists say ruins game played since beginning think youre forgetting two previous wolfenstein titles came wolfenstein new order titles didnt kill franchise nothing willinstead feel inclusion two female main characters story great approach fresh different direction played franchise since wolfenstein far favorite installment franchise yeti would absolutely recommend game anyone playing wolfenstein youngbloods friend bought deluxeversion playing free buddy pass included deluxeversion gunplay feels really good levels really intricate interesting marred goddamn silver coinsystem implemented order buy upgrades weapons use silver coins scattered levels increments pieces boxes containing silver coins upgrade costs silver coins lot upgradesthe reason sucks screws flow gameplay often scenario get area fun mowing everyone spend next minutes scouring every nook cranny get effing silver coins since silver coins instanced means players pick coins never miss loot good also means never really split either go area get available lootand makes coop kind pointless opinion also collectibles including readables floppy disks floppy disks need decrypted floppy disks readables usually code codelocked box box likely lot silver coinsso happens run around spam e order pick everything order amass silver coins upgrades floppy disks decrypt obviously need find computer decrypt order get codes boxes lock get silver coins upgrade weapons crushed enemiesthe silver coins

raytracingpatch written still stands doesnt bother much reason dont know developers game downtime going back definitely way fun compared game released silver coin system didnt feel intrusive beforei completed game since time way positive changed thumbs thumbs completed game core gameplay fun gunplay bit fastpaced puzzle style requiring use certain guns best dispatch certain enemies story fun enough although definitely takes back seat wont spoil anything gets existentiali would recommend aiming later achievements extreeeeeemly grindy loved wolfenstein games recently come game mess would constantly disconnected friend glitch underneath map location multiple times entire story takes ish hours broke heart like game much like definite low point series definitely wait sale bethesda goes bankrupt get free playing long already game extremely fun challenging new colossus thats ok different type game folks say theres like character previous two three old blood games disagree think character different one way slick two good time yet played whole story playing best friend beer good game truly amazing co op experience play alone fulfilling experience co op mode best story far works gameplay incredible shooting dgraphic hair soundmusic nice doom graphical settings got sooooooo many settings truly something everyone like played game couple days great far action super fast paced hectic intense music go lot like doom overall gameplay reminds bit nazi themed rage lots little rpg elements going totally sandbox like skyrim anything critiqued cringey interactions sisters wolfenstein top silly themed game day one keeps going funny ridiculous oklots lore funny silly nazi details place much love wolfenstein games would loved others coop hence excitement thought one garbage though real main mission levels entire game rest cringeworthy side missions stealth elements game foolish unless want endlessly toss op throwing knives dont add silencer anything better yet dont buy game endless spawning new enemies already trod areas seconds leaving makes every move slog final feminist note two three female leads portrayed empty unintelligent childish laughed previously posted complete review say game kind r h honestly dont understand hate people bear title yes rpg shooter id rather classic fps experience well done amusing story good gameplay smooth well worth price let alone grabbing discount getting deluxe edition grabbing friend coop makes proper fun experienceill agree one recurring comment though sisters random dialogue rather cringy xd honestly really like game feels like like rpg like aspects kinda weird mostly stuff like base damage upgrades stuff doesnt make much difference opinion bullet spongy enemies fun kinda adds chaos health bars annoying though stress personally bad thing opinion lot people also mad ai sister single player part game remember game made coop game worth bucks half price normal full game deluxe edition practically gives another copy friend game begs play someone else times better way anywaysdont waste money game one play honestly recommend game im huge fan series ive waited quite lot play feel free invite game note like play stealth lot xd initially gave game bad review ive changed mind think received poorly fans wolfenstein series wasnt wanted expected tried like initially wasnt fun year since release decided give game good second chance put hours see would improve surprise improve grew began really like game beating id say definitely worth playing probably fun replay devs messed imo abiding fans wanted expected ie wolfenstein love mention theres annoying learning curve players endure begin fun bought game ealier today half price thanksgivingblack fridayautumn saleat first game wouldnt launch returned error code publishers website said related graphics drivers updating latest nvidia drivers game plays butter smooth responsive probably due ids contribution doom always super smoothif like modern wolfenstein series new order old blood new colossus probably like youngblood play one bjs annas twin daughters single player campaign twin npcpartner im assuming play coop partnertwin would player invite game another twist share lives twin revive combat really skeptical first usually npc partners really stupid frequently prone getting killed far though npc twin hasnt much liability still would prefer go solo unfortunately isnt option gameso far couple hours play youngblood pretty good story gameplay naziblasting funfest weve come expect franchise couldnt keep playing played new order new colossus pales comparison coop cringey gets massive plot holes abilities one asked forabsolute travesty last two better fix another far better title franchise lost dont know people keep disliking game played actually good twin sisters interesting characters quite good story like prequel combats smooth good last one system leaning towards rpg side still better less arcade fact compared last oneoh make sure turn enemy health bar thats ridiculous wolfenstein keep seeing lot reviews trashing game like borderlands made want play dont like looter shooters bought anyway im glad majority negative steam reviews accurate classifying game looter shooter comparing destiny borderlands looter shooter implies weapons equipment gradually become obsolete longer play turn must grind get best equipment equipment work higher level enemies however grinding weapons better stats special abilities looter shooters good weapons found random percentage game works playing game exploring levels gives money money upgrade equipment low money cannot upgrade likely didnt explore enough spent money wrong things skinswith way game fun friend really appreciate buddy pass thing wish games letting friends owner play free great feature hope see games future mainly bought gameplay setting therefore opinion story probably use review enjoying gameplay setting kind liked departure general formula think lot could explored without involving bj two characters boring forgettable tho game pretends looter shooter nothing interesting loot far understand could theoretically level content pretty much gone whole game seems like confused wanted hardly actual narrative virtually characters talking heads could barely understand radio chatter gunplay pretty good really redeemable part game along gun modding skill perks things game pay locking items behind paywalls weird content game runs day two dont know weirdo went way buy weapon character armor skins game daily missions someone wants log every day play minutes reason beat everything really could extended something interesting compellingoverall would say game bad doesnt know wants would rather game absolutely connection bj family main plot straightforward looter shooter like fallout side game made clear players sidestory stands feels like bizarre combination several genres entire game feels unevenful doesnt even feature bj playable missions anything remotely interesting hitler killed screen inbetween release game previous presumably go back continue story bj next release massive step fun gritted teeth know game get sterling reviews story length bit underwhelming however cannot really play wolfenstein game expect good story admittedly would bonus play shooting things specifically nazis game delivers spadesi thoroughly enjoyed relatively small maps lot content explore also played exclusively still enjoyed ai sister back reminisced borderlands second wind mechanic die sister revive allows play bit recklessly take chancesso personally really enjoyed game though believe objectively may good game youd expect werent bugs experienced animations ai voice acting etc good theres nothing game amazing excellent nothing would take breath away still enjoyed know girls get nerves little old thing said enjoyed game would recommend like gme much like like sue mein honesty game vein others franchise different rpg like approach combat similar style division series played game friend without reading reviews caring said internet know ive fun lots fun still lost majority complaints come enjoyed game many others recently picked single player wise game quite fun ai seems quite times game fun pick try like quite lot think main issue people lost ability read descriptions complaints youngblood wolfenstein reason called spinoff title solo great fun option play coopvery well designed coop even better rpg elements light slightly better new dawn really enjoyed new dawnmore freedom explorationcollecting coins much open levels make rush less enjoy want linear play cod wolfenstein want fun aaa shooter half price go dont wanna play youngblood dont need purchase get mins playtime give bad review youngblood great game terms wants never got advertized wolfenstein dont expect sequel like fun took get used new controls things many sequels different controls like cause far cry new dawn like like different wolf games fits well play people though ai sp ultra derp like game like game playing single player problems people say insignificant dunno real motivation writing negative reviews getting really weird definitely play game single player forced suggested micro payment system either even notice one bunch negative reviews cares theres voluntary one required advance gamei havent encountered technical problems whatsoeverfor game better games released year good graphics runs well story ok great tho importantly story driven person shooter getting rare days another quality release bethesda like game however problems easy know learn lot play game way restart play one mission multiple times dead would like able pick last slug way unknowing boss even move lowest ability make progress like old school type fps duke quake blood shadow warrior grew games dont like forced play women ok jumped annoyance start also dont like partner ai crap really gets caughtor earlier versions got used game addictive appeal like last ones good gfx though still buggy writing random crash errors overall give simple single player fps nice selection weapons
