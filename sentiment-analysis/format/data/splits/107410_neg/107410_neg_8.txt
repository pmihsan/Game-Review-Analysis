unreasonable hardware requirements fanboys tell arma super advanced etc demands lot cpu believe poorly optimised lot units moving framerates stay smooth soon people start shooting performance plummets believe something badly optimised effects demanding ai pretty poor case multiplayer performance even worse considered normal effectively unplayable people accept due game restrictions devs ought really address gameplay terrible bad feels like buggy rather poor design decisions jogging seconds cause start panting creates extreme weapon sway maybe trying simulate walle future fat soldiers really kills gameplay considering size arma missions require lot moving recoil weapons ridiculous feels like guy shooting one hand gun held sideways damage ridiculous enemy targets take headshots chest shots brought adds together completely kill immersion makes game feel like chore immersion keeping mind bad shooting mechanisms ai utterly gamebreaking well empty clip bullets relatively small meter area around enemy target budge flinch keep shooting die probably die awful recoil system place makes aiming player impossible ai basically terminators simply run time time stand still shoot death mod reduces recoil mod player mow ai like fish barrel simply dont move theyve decided stop shoot content really really lacking okay single player campaign pretty dull whats really bad seem left lot content community develop ambient combat module editor unlike arma specops module editor unlike arma quick mission creator unlike arma makes huge difference game means want actually experience sandbox game ai either create relatively complex scripts download missions mods pickup play game disappointing considering arma arma goes wrong many ways gunplay ai stamina damage system basically
