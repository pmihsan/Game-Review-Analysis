seems decided stick aroundyes killed defenceless player using default kit spaa rifle sure ad pop upthanks bohemiain truth love game way dlc advertised absolutely shit would recommend game one reason entirelly game extremely unbelievably poor performance problem huge hours played least waiting lag spike finish another trying get server kicking reason friend server sees im getting kicked without explanation kicking happens often many times per game session days completely shits tries give gets extremely annoying repulsive combine lag writting plus average fps lag spike even lowest settings makes game time spent game absolute pain moment simply arent worth sufferingps im getting poor performance friend mentioned plays cpu graphics procesing gets lot better performance would recommend game crashes randomly minutes since learned known fault cannot find fix forums disappointed steam refused refund well truly ripoff would rate always die loading screen would reccomend game fun exellent level editor problem price would say game like military simulator anything else really generation one kind sort thing features realistic bullet mechanics penetration voice communication cant talk without radio example building damage enough explosives example flatten whole compound recoil bullet drop bullet mechanics essence still wanted mention onvehicles also pretty realistic ones mods dont detailed interiors vanilla theyre still pretty cool drive around also absolutely love rear view camera merkava another thing love however ton tank wont stop tracks theres tree fence front ita feature makes stand modding workshop support means people add hell lot content game like example modern weapon systems like gpmg saw even make entirely new game instance warhammer mod complete overhaul brings space marines imperial guard xenos chaos onwith said however game issues optimization bugsglitches example squad bunch run building might start bleeding torso take time grit actually get hang stop dying stupid shit ai also seems brain dead certain cases need babysitting sometimes youre making scenario ive noticedi also got nolifer buddy runs makes hardcore missions admirable perseverance almost cultlike devotion game able ignore learned adapt overcome games many small obstacles make unpleasant people truly reached form godhood amongst us plebian simple men also commendable nerves steel dealing us lesser retards mission wanna fuck around would strongly advise anyone buying game dozens reasons game many shortcomings missing features industry standard decades throughout game severe lack quality attention detail contrary game advertises realistic flexible issues range small large mods unable fix last decade arma various expansions arma continues trend take hours write every point low quality mention big offenders incomplete weapon animations single weapon sets animations done mods cannot fix present game meddling quality often hands uniforms clipping weapons sounds fully synced ai gets lost stuck runs shoots back frequently also walk many objects props map immersion breaking mission editor buries common frequently used functions graphical user interface gui often requiring memorize many complex scripts example making mission end killing certain enemies require script written games dcs janes usaf via gui poor squad ai command interface slow cumbersome inaccurate squad movement commands want accurately position team members like tactical shooters luck unrealistic weapon sway point aiming hitting someone meters front iron sights chore ai difficulty following roads even place highly detailed waypoints ai severe difficulty crossing bridges even well placed waypoints way make waypoint automatically follow road common games mission editors dcs flight simulator ai fairly inconsistent inconsistency increases larger mission almost every remedial task editor require form scripting either game via external file scripts simple assigning artillery one player may require full page paragraph script written player loadout editing fairly limiting cannot carry two rifles example common many real world snipers vehicle damage modelling sub par mostly relies hit point based system damage enemy ai often unfairly cheats player abnormally weak cant hold rifle steady enemies spin around prone position spot laying prone grass meters away get head shot within shots tweak accuracy general ranges terminator blind man ai severe difficulty navigating indoors includes frequent clipping walking walls likewise ai often gets lost cities cluttered areas player often stop walking take minute rest every minutes wait team members find poor control layout ui function open door also switches pistol ammo type number things often times may trying close door option disappear scroll menu player instead swap pistol many seemingly simple things possible exiting boat walking onto pier possible instead fall water clumsily swim around find ladder present also true ai making ai surrender mid level type mission editing require many scripts different grenade types present via mods quality effects low end dont expect flash bangs work like flash bangs placing plane runway making take requires lot effort necessary flight sims automatically clicks yet arma requires much many shortcomings come mind summarize arma limited frustrating mods scripts occasionally offer patch jobs shortcomings fix experience game lacks detailed micro management found games swat older rainbow titles also lacks attention detail flight sim genre made common simulators many instances movement weapon handling mainstream games battlefield top arma arma could much better ultimately falls flat anyone values quality realism inconsistency immersion breaking actions awkward workarounds ai limitations prevent anything basic missions playing convincingly eventually placing bunch units little walk shoot get old disappointed limitations holding back mission designs would recommend arma arma apex piece meal dlcs would suggest game werent abhorrent dlc practices going bohemian wont stop releasing dlc manages make game unplayable dont
