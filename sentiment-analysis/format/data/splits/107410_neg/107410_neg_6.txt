shiznik one said fight war pants one said fight war pants one says fight war pants one says fight war pants recomiendo este juego por las siguientes razones pobre del engine casi todas las partidas que jugado en las corro con alrededor de fps cuando la la puedo jugar entre fps malos servidores pareciera que cada servidor tiene como mods por lo que debes realizar una descarga cada vez que quieres iniciar en diferentes servidores pesar de que tengas buena se si es la cantidad de jugadores lo sobrecargado que el mapa es casi imposible disfrutar del juego ninguna de las armas poseen los nombres originales por lo que entiendo el costo del juego es posible que este juego cueste alrededor de euros cuando casi todo el armamento equipo utilizado en el juego es ficticio por lo que los desarrolladores tuvieron que pagar por ninguna clase de derechos de autoreste juego lo yo sino que fue un regalo de mi primo por lo que le agradezco absolumente por el gesto sin embargo ambos sabiamos que este titulo iba ser tan defectuoso run gun game screaming kids servers allow smooth joining need pay ridiculous amount dlcs servers modded mod anywhere game sucks way better call duty feel cheated

stealthy use environmental advantages ai xray autoaim thats relief squad likely make kills leave dust since stamina affect way affects also certain characters infinite health theres real urgency helping firefights time kick back let everyone else funthen theres weird controls rolling floor literally cover right incoming fire thats last thing enemy expects youll try scavenge weapons ammo fallen soldiers shot dead trying navigate extremely simple intuitive equipment interface guess thats fault able perform actions per minute plus steal clothing make wear glasses bandanas real tactical advantage besides trolling fallen soldier forgot mention youll bleed die dont bandage arm first aid kit shot anywhere body thats actually pretty realistic since medical fact arm hub blood circulation health youre wounded aim mobility decrease point thats real wont able contribute positive way except cannon fodder enemy ok though die youll get respawn full health restart checkpoint cant fire gun
