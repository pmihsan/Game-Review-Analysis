review game five years old yet still hideously annoying setup basic coop game friends really basic stuff cannot reccomend game enough many gamemodes ways play arma much milsim game pour hours intoi would reccomend people fence buy wont regret cannot recommend game arma still alive wellfirst game lacking content example weapons vehicles exact different nations different paint schemes map huge great till look closer buildings empty furniture nothing lot assets missing even basic objectsbuildings missions around since ofp days like cti arent therethe gun handling feels like something straight battlefield know control recoil way hard basically goes straight completely accurate fully automatic weaponthe character handling feels awkward coming someone hours arma know awkward controls like movement speeds take around keystrokes get inout happened good old days pressing w going isnt damn car dont switch gears depending speed going atspeaking cars cars handle awkwardly aswell acceleration ridiculous takes forever get around switches afterburner goes hey look afterburner oh wait trainer jet stealth freak thingy oh boy much wrong planes helicopters game love aviation hell im trying make job part hurts begin thislets start easiest trainer supposed carry weapons youre gonna tell gonna go battle air support ha good jokeim gonna honest like looks looking thing never going happen much less years still well get upgraded next years would probably systems avionics either build entirely new aircraft scratch replace already existing ground poundersoh boy comes big one damn stealth freak much wrong even funny alright lets start stealthing aircraft sharp edges bounce radar different direction coming whole aircraft needs sharp guys enginesnotice something stealth aircraft flying around today internal stores dont want suckers reflecting radar signals youthe subsonic cas close air support ground pounder literally designed fuck enemy theyll know hit wont matter cause theyll either dead equipment fucked shoot back use stealthing plane flying everyone mother seeing bad boyits also supposed take damage whole titanium bathtub shit whatnot sharpening edges adding structural failure points event know missile hitting itim aircraft engineer makes sense someone reading actually aircraft engineer please tell wrong right amsame goes stealthing helicopters mean come going stealth fucking rotor spinning hundreds rpm constantly changing pitchanglethe things work cant take choppers merge together add stealth bullshit expect anyone take seriouslyarma set near future around years look military history century progress peak vietnam kind slowed till mid less standstill still using tanks aircraft weapons designed perfectioned takes world war major conflict sort get us asses put thinking caps really think years aks etc service replaced new standard caseless shells wont still using abrams strikers bmp well probably unfortunatly probably pak fa others stuff likely old shit fancy new systemsi half blame dayz game turned dayz iswas good modgame attracted wrong kind people arma didnt attract milsim people attracted general public likes shooters zombies funny thing dayz servers find arma stupid vehicles ones military weapons every corner everyone shooting everyone else chernogorsk thats survival thats glorified deathmatch either way digress bohemia probably decided make game accessible people leading casualized shadow greati could let whole doesnt seem finished part slide werent releasing dlc parts arent finished expecting pay bucks helicopters barely base game begin withand agree future bs thing ive saying fixed mods modded servers popular modding general public wants grab one one mods like dayztldr casual version arma designed cater general public want military simulator id recommend arma feel like arma overwhelming probably game cant even get servers sometimes says session lost times says kicked game committed war crime could learned instrument get good grasp another language decided dump fat amount time killing people take ao could spend hours game still would terrible couldve sworn got thing searching beginning oh well therell always time doubt couldnt get clunky game badly ran couldnt pick weapon dead enemy dlc order use crash carfriend stops gokart next mepolice arrivesi tell friend stole carpointed carhe checks outi steal gokarti drive fast possiblei crash crashed helicopter made grown man cry died lost cried finished campaign cry everytime decided review game enough time multiplayer singleplayer feel confident personal opinion arma fourth arma game played third favourite may seem like bad opinion considering quality previous games series actually isnt performance playing incredibly poor machine gpu cpu stranger low framerates freezing said arma incredible range optimization many reviewers complain getting ultra setting playing server players fighting ai games larger map altis even machine get largescale battles maps large multiplayer servers considering game wellcontent content arma game little light landvehicle department first arma game get frequent updates constanly improving adding contentoverall view arma least complete arma game thus far updates excuse considering pricepointoverall would recommend game fan military games watch reviews gameplay first quite expensive decided play altis lifei ran buy cari drove pick applesi drove another sell applesi got fined police looking suspicousagain ran buy cari drove pick applesi drove another sell applesand someone spawned dildocopter made quad bikes killed mei rate nan rates god sake leave man fucking apples decided upgrade pc come back game year still fucking looks performs like xbox game laggy even lowest graphics

uh kd points uh stuff discovered arma series arma immediatly drawn sandbox style game play got creating mods game carried arma brining mods arma new ones overall would say sadly dissapointed arma whole game brings little way content doesnt come additional cost dlcs infact large part games factions copy pasted turrets vehicles static weapons uavs game mechanics upgrade still present sometimes major problems seen arma unrefined collision detection system poor online stability syncronization game looks nice enough however much cartoony previous game gritty appearance dlcs far largest dissapointments brining little way new content often issues deal saving grace game mods available often adding things opinion missing vanilla version game end hours arma since release alpha aside initial tests campaign vanilla servers never likely never play without modifications said game worth cost free content added modding communityif liked arma understand mods want graphics upgrade means pick game like game reason cant start game problem diffrent versions problem arma website tell fix every problem exept one u good pc recomend recommendits simply badly engineered poorly optimizedkeep youre money get better money thet eg pubgcod etc regret spendign hrs game understan war played exeptional one also belive better thks dont condone use guns kill enemy commander assigned recommend saw

company might know least thing two game far games ive long time one keep going back beating arma scripting system designed simple missions however comparable experience making long complicated ctis maybe call stockholm syndrome like coming back reliable consistent abuse timeless ai flying tanks game miss playing miss life simple missed fps missed black friday sale wait next missed birth son game op times op times karen battle buddies need mistaken rock car mostly blame space computer sad say uninstall gamefun gameplay enough servers rg pvp survival coop missions realistic coop missions unrealistic much mods bullet drop physics vehicleland sea air gameplay zeroing personal favorite parts game need new hard drive reinstall game moved arma friends recommendation came hoping see improvements especially vehicle movement ui weaponvehicle variety ai mechanics however quite disappointedi knew game took place future everything looks like halomodern battlefield orgy like american weaponry vehicles dont expect really see anything familiar base gamewith workshop download plenty mods find gameplay mechanics inherent game really problem addition seems vehicle realism absolutely dropped arma humvees taking rpgs crewmen surviving tank goes like nuke armor values outdated vehicles way high modern ammunition power values way low set largescale vehicle battle takistan enemy using team using variants apfsds find rounds incapable piercing armor ammunition cut mine yea vehicle realism really hit fanand even get started ai holy crap whether base game modded game ai horrendous say enemy ai would make think theyre super soldiers constructed dna best spec ops operators world guys capable standing walking one direction enemies nail excess meters iron sites guys fail see enemy thermal feet away yes regular occurrence even enhanced ai mods problem still prevalentthen actual characters talk super soldiers physically well enemies least playing yesterday friend shot arm manning vehicle turret died would hit enemy times times head would continue running firing us precision inspecting ace medical viewer shows indeed struck multiple times dropping wasnt game lag made appear hit problem especially problematic vanilla game enemies really super soldiers whatever reasonso overall say compared arma many mods tune game liking scripting way better increasing fps run game smoothly maximum graphics even mods installed hard time running arma ii medium quality movement infantry vehicles lot smoother especially movement enhancing mods active online community weapon customization especially arsenal definitely convenient thing zeus eden editor make game editing lot easier ui much convenientcons futuristic combat environment seems completely isolated previous installments personal bias mine vanilla game lacks wide variety weapons vehicles enemy ai ridiculously high allied ai absolutely horrid leading effective member team environment enemy problem hitting iron sites meters away vehicle realism horrendous compared arma due armor values certain vehicles way high power values certain antitank munitions way low said using arma arma enemies way much health allies seem made range target paper bad point head shots enemy often fail drop could die single shot leg armtldr many small things improved upon many big things got lot worse makes game play lot less fun much
