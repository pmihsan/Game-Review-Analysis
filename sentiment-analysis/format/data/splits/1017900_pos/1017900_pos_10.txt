way bigger see bstarcraft remasteredb example yet bage empires deb remake done right even though lot stuff modern realtime strategies added example youll able use rally points part original gameplay pathfinding pretty big problem back days improved already improved brise romeb expansion theres new zoom feature etc etc etcthe funniest thing though even changes game manages feel somehow im kidding ive played finished bdefinitive editionb original version sidebyside must say original soul totally loved original bage empiresb back days youll love updated version especially since campaigns main game official expansion heck even bfirst punic warb campaign trial version bthe rise romeb wasnt full game case didnt know included totally love attention details herenow bad stuff first atmosphere sucks mean yes gameplaywise game feels totally right stupid new voiceover sucks especially awful narrator wholl narrate briefings mean original bage empiresb even though quite lot bright colors certain kind atmosphere one reasons many people called mix bwarcraftb bsid meiers civilizationb even though never liked comparison much mist admit theres sure something voices units music menus certain mood new voiceover menus game started feel way bright thanks almost like comedy thanks stupid narrator darker mood gone game began feel like well like bage empires onlineb know mean atmospherewise bsettlersb baoeb cant say like doesnt sound like big thing sure way especially since baoeb always relied multiplayer quite lot like youll need atmosphere simply wont time still cant help feel certain something ruined together old atmospherethe cutscenes also completely removed pretty much nothing replace nobody played baoeb cutscenes still well theres lot small cons example optimization better got lot weird bfpsb drops bxboxb integration little big bugged achievements pop delay case one bugged unlocked bsteamb stayed locked bxboxb profile baib pretty dumb cant say hated dumb baib much though mean make computer way smart baoeb wont feel certain balance smart baib old school experience personally think right even kept baib exactly nasty back days leave one enemy

quite easily laptop quad core ram nvidia graphics cardi feel game overhauled graphically care taken optimise correctly lowend machines like dressed cash grab unless gaming rig set back several hundred really sense playing gets extra attention run smoother anything isnt dedicated gaming rigi run games like deus ex human revolution fairly well graphical masterpiece certainly stretches limits laptop run still playable nonetheless definitive edition hand definitely unplayableid much rather play game original graphics optimisation later os improved resolution overhauled graphical turd updated ui
