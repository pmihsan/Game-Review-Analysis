got hands say indeed great fun play game years nostalgia coming back hardthe little quality life improvements quite pleasant overall ive wonderful experience retreading familiar ground imagine continue going forwardsnow said would recommend game anyone grow playing instead looking something new interesting gamethe pathfinding awful little quality life improvements worth fact youre buying game two decades old whose core mechanics refined match sequel age empires ii ultimately superior game get new rerelease ownif youre buying nostalgias sake like go ahead get game glorious fun available youre new understand game era entails dont expect complex gameplay intelligent unitspersonally going buy remade aoe game first time would wait new version age empires ii comes leave game aloneit little value beyond nostalgia team behind done great job bringing newer standard game really fun return childhood although game really great game much fun also great tool learning history multiplayer games brought family back together game fun like thank game funbut hard control unit psif used play dont recommend two better game rehashing classic albeit entirely outshined game inception rts genre quality life improvements great opportunity diehard fans play classic game modern hardware modern waywhats great execution gtx setup although cpu bottlenecked youd think wouldnt much trouble running game effectively although run modern games play save euiv one seems get abysmally poor graphics settings dont help much either setting makes discernible difference scaling drop menu putting seems affect sprites used zoomedin game rather anything might affect actual cpu usagesave main menu every screen looks straight tier noname get buying random steam key bad multiplayer chore well trying navigate menus find lobby deal fact ranks broken since launch year ago therefore ranked matching finding game general ive ever able find people online despite much higher playerbasefrom game standpoint title doesnt hold either especially greater titles aoe ii aoe iii yes know run well proper looking menus game magnitude consistent online playerbase importantly civilizations doubt lifeblood every rts game minute advantages disadvantages civilization may another rts game every civilization would grow old fast exactly age empires de original early rts game included number civilizations none advantages eg speical units special buildings etc instead found de facto differences owning entirely units great pool didnt access say difference chinese greeks chinese dont access phalanx upgrade tree original also bonuses exacerbated differences factions gameplay changes hittites health bonus catapults even changed de lowered making difference gameplay much less civilizations explains unlike age empires ii de aoe de didnt see addition new civs theres way differentiate already existing civs without adding new units access toalthough enjoy game really tide release age empires ii de cant recommend anyone looking get rts isnt explicitly age empires best version first game run modern operating systemsd game provides nice flashback original game period taking back memories original units considering infantry structures preserved gameplay enhanced creating really vivid fancy experience graphics decent campaigns stories insightful guys love history game great choice play info walkthrough definitely recommend points game part childhood fact im playing adult brings much nostalgia hadnt invested much time game refunded explain later say gameplay mechanics felt exactly classic version released years ago even pathfinding original game kept may annoying lot people totally acceptable felt like im playing game difference graphics course think done well game felt modern looked gorgeousso reason refunded hoping could fun online multiplayer letdown trying find online game without region filter could find halffilled rooms seasia seemed like one playing game anymore even though newly released month might done wrong idkto wrap definitely worth sales even worth buy game want feel piece childhood hd graphics would big fun play friends lan online
