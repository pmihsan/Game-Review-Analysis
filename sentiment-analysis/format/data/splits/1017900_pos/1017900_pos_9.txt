work perfect age empires rebootthe voice acting marvelous campaign narrations unit grunts normally wouldnt mention smooth professional overlookedthe music also really well done heard excellent remake original primitive midi soundtrackand turned right soundtrack fitting stays enjoyable throughout gamethere stutter issues though first start new game game stutters starts playing smooth random fps drops across game priest sprite also stuttering positions like moving straight upwardsnow need effort terms pathfinding well cant complain pathfinding original year old game horrible one much better playable leastthey also need remake original intro cutscenes opinion game doesnt feel without old charmthe major downer lack indian civlization despite richest ever imperial civilization human history industrial era extremely powerful era one point largest form mauryan empire original ms devs left india reason definitive edition sadly would love see india civ game either unified one like broken two distinctive cultures arya dravidaa good game far id happily recommend anyone familiar franchise pretty good game though one favorites probably would really liked played original back day since didnt nostalgia factor doesnt play like visuals though soundtrack really catchy however playing could tell old game doesnt refinements qualityoflife features recent rts titles still entertaining times got lost lost track time decent repainting classic really fun game play easily pause middle life things need get done rewritten review loved great game happy play updated graphics first downloaded played game difficulties constant crashes displeased however short developers game published new update fix problem far problems allhow team behind game handled situation wasnt one problem look game see team behind age empires de truly want old classic best happy say done really good job treat fans classic age empires numerous quality life upgrades also addresses lopsided nature many bonuses classic version balance changes gripe doesnt go way army formations gates option start dedicated scout basically graphically technologically uplifted version classic aoe experience includes content base aoe rise rome expansion pack conveniently combined separate executables original release means everything aoe better worse con think original pathfinding ai sometimes craps needs little bit babying original enough really problem happen twice course entire ascent egypt learning campaigning consider pretty good essentially era strategy game overall would definetely recommend defacto way play modern systems imo best entry point new players classic experience almost none classic jankyness brilliant mostly way remember playable graphics updated looks great runs well issue miss able upgrade space age gates walls bit strange would still give top rating recommendation great feel would better could go original eras far challenging chance build ais attack continue attacking fun remember good stuff like remember original additions issue mouse freeze rarely second game also select game looks like originally selecting option change anything still real crashes would highly recommend game significantly difficult newer aoe games im greatest player world standard difficulty game like hard aoe even easy theyre pretty aggressive tech trees dont make sense locations various techs research really odd computer also super smart knows target lowest health units battles thing genuinely superior least compared aoe autorebuild farm option newer versions polishedrefined user friendly isnt worth playing one better options great blast past fond memories original game played family growing definitive edition lives memories best classic rts game genius always classic aofe game lovely hires texture graphics great quality life featureshowever many users found fps game appalling performance obviously system specific makes sense remastered modern version classic run well major graphics

um jogo que amamos refeito em uma qualidade melhor mas sempre medo de estragarem tudo nao foi caso jogo ficou comprem sem medo ba criminally underrated game age empires ii blew predecessor water high still hasnt come years later said deserves time sun fantastic remasteroverall strong recommend decent value price bthe forgotten empires dev team rocky time last years releases hailed really well much age mythology hd common guys one seems one good ones aside catastrophic bugs peoples games crash game wise still game remember youre plays like age empires models much higher ress sequels spites simplicity beauty aoe simply doesnt also causes issues path finding units bump cause blockages aoe ii simply suffer fromcampaign wise game explores ancient classical periods campaign exploring ancient greece various periods history good bunch fact think prefer aoe ii setting least disclaimer first impressions review full review empires definitive edition game developed forgotten empires tantalus published xbox game studios remastered version classic age empiresthe game offers nice graphics environments although ugly glitches pleasant sameage empires definitive edition overall however fun game play get boring played long time good strategy rts game play short recommended review sources blist none finally remaster empires first pcgame came first homecomputer loved remember many great hours playing alone brother years remaster released great job still one best games ever recommendation people wanting revisit game newcomers series alike bobf bebmpires one important strategy games history true titan genre classic position lot concerns remaster game one hand fully deserves second youth todays standards pretty barebones rts mechanicswise many respects archaic position much room developers remaster want remain faithful original dozen minutes game breathed sigh relief apart beautiful audiovisual setting aoe de game extremely faithful original avoiding making changes gameplay better worse apart absolutely necessary proper functioning mainly multiplayeralthough would love see first part recreated convention current aoe ii de honest remaster required restraint creators definitely showed focusing complete reconstruction entire visual setting significantly improves experience game compared original real eye candy moment terms content quality product whole nothing much criticizefor time premiere game problems proper functioning especially ai fortunately everything patched age empires definitive edition working nicely ba fantastic way relive first time aoe lots fun single multiplayer enthusiastsif know youre getting recommend heart especially promotional campaigns steam complete entire series fraction normal price way also highly recommend going back checking original release rise rome expansion playable ever still lot magic years run fine modern systems case issues theres decent number solutions overcome worth part history real wololo start review saying game doesnt deserve negativity getting people love memeurl also love bash first age empires biggest characteristic age empires series every game unique way youre expecting similar game aoe youll disappointed keep open mind youll find lot enjoyment actual game started great reworked graphics game remaster remake means faithful original game including oldschool clunkyness still forgotten empires developers added great quality life features like farm reseeding tech queues indicator many idle villagers walkable farms higher population cap minor additions also worth mentioning ai greatly improved compared original compared microsoft store launch last year ai improvements made primarily add spice skmirmish matches sideeffect making campaign levels unfairly hard game also features reworked soundtrack recorded orchestra personally dont like muchurl composer charge changed several melodies killing nostalgic mood imagine someone rerecorded classic jonesurl theme starting fine changing notes way thats feels dont want fanciness enable modeurl custom games uses original graphics soundtrack gameplay mode poorly implemented though several reasons cant use campaigns cant use multiplayer starts vanilla soundtrack rather rise rome soundtrack like used original expansion interface definitive edition totally nostalgic cant choose midi recorded soundtrack gold edition im hoping issues solved near future would good could choose use original sound effects outside classic mode rerecorded sounds truly awful yeah changed classic url sound another rogan sounds like came drunk high pitched voice actor unbelievable sets aoe apart compared aoe never played first age empires know lot strategies age empires ii dont work starters theres gate actually love one ever safe need creative walls placement sometimes even creating mazes mashes environment theres also land trading way buy sell resources market need plan good strategy ahead soon uncover map army formations well brute raw theres scout start want explore map without hurting progress avoiding using villagers explore advance second age tool age train scout could also use clubman trained barracks theyre slow dont uncover lot map pathfinding lot simplerpoor even slightly better definitive edition compared age empires ii huge problem micromanaging units one pillars rts genre everything stated paragraph makes age empires favorite series much less automated comfortable successors providing strategic experience worth full price much love first age empires im sure could recommend full price everyone whole different beast compared age empires ii modern rts games however enjoyed original andor used older games go ahead pick right wait sale
