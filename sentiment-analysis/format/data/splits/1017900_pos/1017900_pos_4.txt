gfx driver initially held buying game due greed microsoft wanting force use subpar consoleported store later filled survey regarding future series gave opinion subject aoe de future aoe games shouldnt exclusive store happy find listened community put game steam however much enjoyed nostalgia taunts sound effects music aesthetic game found wildly unpolished ai unplayable several quality life issues needed addressed original game shouldve fixed bringing century include arent limited idle villager buttons better pathing units updated ai lan ffs highlight noticeable within first two hours playing computers friend also bought game far competitive online experience could never see playing current pathing sending literally ships tile wide river feels like watching one old rush hour games game

whole game forget ai horrendously easy played aoe childhood nonvoobly player recently couldve brand new game beaten hardest ai played friend thinking would challenge seeing newer ais aoe games come far stomping decided another waste time decided way challenge go afk minutes beginning play open map actually managed lose game ai came singled one us higher tier units completely walked around tried would come better strategy likely beat ai easy poorly done way making challenge afk game arent fun play modernize game actually put money probably wont play fully appreciate effort microsoft revitalizing game putting steam development downfall game cant recommend game ok guess greatthe pathfinding really awful armies never group together formations forget formations army hoplites cant use phalanx jokealso graphics arent even nice looks like old backdrop original character models look place floating gifs battlefield looks oddeven largest skirmish maps tiny normally barely space build buildings take tonnes space almost never enough room build houses needall terrible doesnt exactly come steep price think original graphics better little pixelated overall im extremely disappointed product especially considering amazing age empires definitive edition looks real half assed job love put cant recommend last played game early even better remember course ai getting point point b ridiculous would nice could automate certain actions like civ allinall age empires legendary great game reason campaign mode kept occupied many many hours im even onequarter way yet last played game years ago child fells great go back actually read history playing throught campaigns remaster absolutely gorgeous well worth money like age empires definitive edition better old age empires like
