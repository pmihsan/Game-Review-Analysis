awesome honest aoe ii fixed lots issues aoe pretty fun game overall desync issues multilplayer drags pretty much remember og game adding auto reseeding good addition though previously purchased refunded ago decided give another try fall saleactually really appreciate updated graphics nice attention detail especially zoomed inmusic tracks good path finding far needs lot work units wonder constantly brought back gamehope fixed probably drastic effective aoe upgrade three pros good old know lovecons exactly good old know love let explain furtherwhile de name says keeps many things made aoe better resource trading system unless gold gold trading shipspath finding exactly bad original tech costs rebalanced still need gold upgrade gold farming stone improve stone population limit campaign still houses still give pop pointsthat said pretty good game time improved version game graphics also rebalancing changes music wich going talk nowchanges graphics game compatible units turning animation wich wish could disabled problem animation sometimes units get stuck inside units usually de stuck still annoying however doesnt happen oftenrebalancingfarms like de auto restocked set granary wheel far cheaper civs passives toned absolutely broken original aoe others changed due passives way focused water teamwork onlyyou tech tree available see checking manual wiki zoom function defensive stance attack movement attacking doesnt override stances combine different unit creation even queue tech unit together important info right hud know many villagers used resource even actually working wich confusing wasnt idle villager maniac always using idle villager button new feature tho rise romenow lets talk biggest contention point campaignas said pop limit still adding brain dead ai difficulties also reworked maps easier good way first babylon map holy man still nightmare even got resources hunt campaign possibly hardest original game cakewalk reason forgotten empires nerfed skirmish levels skirmish levels levels start limited set units find trough level cant build replenish troops hunt mother skirmish levels unforgiving requires good use troops specially priestswhat give villagers lots resources gather since ai set defensive waiting next move like original level dont worry attacked dont even worry accidentally killing villagers later find kind situation repeats every map used limited resources maps actually made new map instead actually harder ones used skirmishes cakewalkthe yamato campaign worst original rushed difficulty place fe good job getting rid yamato maps didnt play ror yet hope lot changed ror maps refined didnt really need reworkoverall play game campaign even difficulty curve place still plays really good dont bother multiplayer people playing superior aoe definitive great piece history despite aging good still damn fine playimproved ai skirmishes campaign ai seems less stupid vanilla aoe anything hard makes brain dead remember original aoe moderate pretty challenging way easy pc gives attacking fast main problem campaing population limit game spends lot population villagers barely attacks due population lumberjacks dont expect lot challenge campaign thismusic okay wish og ost available mostly new one good lacks impact dont mind losing music care rise rome music ost doesnt good service original wich top tier prosits aoe know nice qol improvements graphical enhancements gorgeous rerecorded soundtrackboth graphical updates soundtrack recording maintain original feeling character aoe bring fidelity

smells like others pointed bit mixed bag bought aoe game grew theres ton nostalgia involved also single player rating thats bought honestly dont see wouldnt play wanted play aoe noticeably game early days rts pathfinding still infancy archers cant hit target doesnt move straight line towards bonus damage triangular balance wasnt thing added waypoints amove pathfinding core mechanics werent noticeably touched issues remain quite bit influence much fun game units get stuck quite bitotherwise solid game factions different strengths weaknesses looks isnt superdominant unit doesnt counter low supply limit forces often micro small balanced armies think bit outside box aoe surprisingly solid campaign mission design often rewards exploration generally missions funin terms remake gets loved way original felt sounds went menu soundtrack general representation mostly gone menu looks feels generic minimalistic soundtrack mostly replaced occasionally hints original tracks option switch things would appreciated campaigns outros voiced unlike multiple voice actors fitting accents voiced dialogues missions single one gets bit tiring listen whilethat said new tracks nice fit atmosphere new effects neat de makes game look every bit pretty idolized memory freaking gorgeous pictures really dont justice higher resolution naturally icing cakeoverall easy see became classic also got completely replaced realistically pathing holding back quite bit think easily worth trying bucks currently offered interest rts antiquity played liked original certainly cant compete titles full price range like far enjoying game new graphics better expected great original campaigns fully voiced introductions conclusions havent experienced crashes serious bugs others reporting minor issue far dont think one easily fixed part original game units often trouble pathing around sometimes get stuck choke points far everything seems still game cheat codes units extra weird stuff editor first age empires new coat paint added content feels like good deal grab sale sure recommend full price far played one two mp games definitely come game works smoothly hiccups fps nothing really noticeable

new graphics enginecons bad ai movement buggy units sometimes get stuck inside move group may limit original game maximum supply cap seem like limit hardware time intentional creative think balance issues game minor thing recreation quality life improvements noticeable graphics upgrade also glaring failures fix outstanding issues get de instead something something childhood gameaoe rts game based antiquity stone age iron age goes roman times one progenitors rts genre youve played rts game point life chances followed similar formula make workers gather resources make buildings make soldiers beat opponentthe remaster comes brand new beautiful graphics reworked soundtrack well many quality life improvements balance patches new functions example unit stances absent old version changes farms walkable like aoe instead regular buildingswhile nowadays largely lingers shadow child aoe game holds surprisingly well larger blockier units well general lack preset formations allow body blocking arrows slow seeable allows dodge manually move units side things like make aoe potentially microintensive focusing controlling small amount units tho late game deathballs still much resources map run quickly even wood lack gates well presence powerful options age make aoe generally aggressive version aoe age games less common games ending age fundamentals aoe still apply aoe choice civs map types offer allows good amount variety play enjoyable people played latter installment like rts games general however balance game place civs particularly dominant like romans languishing bottom tiers like carthage greekstheres plenty campaigns chew take long time even one intend dive multiplayer still active case reader wondering singleplayer offerings keep one engaged long money spentcontent ratio important campaigns rather challenging one plays high difficulties scenarios significantly simplistic due lack triggers inmission voice might come stale time since scenarios rely starting little building base beating opponentoverall gorgeous well put together remaster classic appeal lot genre fans nostalgia soooo running great crashes update crashing nonstop super sad love game dont like getting game crash shortly would give like stars since fine yeah thumbs difficult keep crashing give since childhood lol start humble beginnings three villagers town

millions hard copies microsoft come back remaster series unexpected grateful thought id never see dayi spending quite bit time im glade microsoft finally brought steam first place think guys know touches left polish game gem time flickering overlapping ui campaign mission aftermaths love voiced briefings tho computer ai diplomacy working gameplay would amazing microsoft implement least keep random chance like original another gripe however small upon zooming units textures close blurring path finding much improved original well still happen always apart experience micro men right problem avoid tight spaces fight open ground unless missile superiority cause shooting gallery plan city easy routes troops move throughto everyone game must buy old fans anyone young new game great fun well

ms refunded purchaseaside delivers expect fair isnt much want play game preferably oppositionquick update ai later evening playing couple pop gameslow level ai shared player primarily pathfinding always issues aoe seem slightly less traffic blockades farm fields passable still course experienced games shortcomings likely beginner would greater trouble problems noted probably always well army often dissipating multitask something else decided walk chase villager spam defending towers yeah theres stand ground command default behavior remembered initial location would nicehigh level ai flips challenging completely unchallenging example large island map invading korean faction counterattacking one swordsman time predictably getting slaughtered blew half base suddenly attacked wiped siege force enemies liked sending one ship time repeat sure different original sometimes targeting smart units prefer move lot instead shooting worst even spastically getting indecision loops moving back forthi get impression high level ai works put fight pose threat perhaps enough change outcome making battles still feel like cleanup beginner might trouble though far best aoe player compare remember original game strategic ai may well slightly better difficult tell without going back play original wont steam review still fun game easy play hours without breaking sweat still one best rts games ever made personally havent run bugs issues games connectivity havent played game favor purchase still one finest classic totally fun enjoyable still awesome game ever stop cryingthis dared hope
