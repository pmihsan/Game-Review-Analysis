programmer b shame didnt care pathfinding developing gates accept game mechanics cobol programmer even could see many opportunities enhancements applied could programmers game lazyand b betatester b either distracted notice lag gave programmers lame played age empires perfect nostalgia trip played original game well worth pick sale reason say since newer version aoe arent many mods game compared original online game operates elo ranking system like elo system used halo back day find superior ranking systems used starcraft halo siege since gives accurate reading stand rankings biggest gripe game campaign narrator narrator absolutely obnoxious talks like speaking bunch year olds bad dont even pay attention campaign descriptors gives info mission background history event hints complete mission added way mute disable campaign narrator id grateful another small nitpick building destruction animations smooth like building kind melts nothing collides kind slides hard describe noticeable watch animations otherwise game gets recommended since upscaled version original aoe plays exactly like original models better graphics remember playing kid youll like lot yes theres lot problems mainly path finding first opened campaign felt like youre new age empires series wouldnt recommend bad game lacking polish way better aoe titles id recommend buy age empires ii definitive edition aoe

always partial aoe ii definitive editions gameplay changes really close gap achievements arent nearly ludicrously grindy hd editionno major complaints except wish added unit outlines displayed behind things still solid rts years later age empires one great old strategy games fun game id recommend people love old school rts yes good lookin one graphics look good etc age empires still awesome game classic rts improvements make worth revisiting even moved past sequels crazy fun distinct improvement aoe demo played kid fun interesting play gameruns smoothly old lollooking forward aoe definitive edition good game playability clearly better original maybe good today standards least decent add nostalgia becomes really good game good time playing campaigns recommended like rts games played original game good improvement form original one gorgeous game runs well enough computer great level detailbutmp worth playing pop cap campaign missionsthat horrendous pathfindingi spent dollars probably finish couple campaigns im still fairly disappointed unless money spare absolutely buy hd instead game cannot really speak nostalgic never played one kid maybe youd love graphical overhaul rts released gameplay changes minimal might explain lot complaints slow pace questionable pathfinding someone regularly enjoys experiencing revisiting older sometimes much older games point first secondgeneration realtime strategy games used like try playing original warcraft dosbox example personally love experienced fps problems people far anyways im hrs like steady pace game playing tutorial campaign huge nostalgia high would recommend anyone played aoe back day experience series whole age empire ii hd though prepared adapt charmingyetoutdated rts mechanics great remake aoe fun play brings back lot memoriesits unfortunate much bugs left unfixed game remember settings campaing progress stored cloud game issues high dpi displays ui redesigned sexy classic aoe great update remains faithful original weird formula hasnt needed much updating reskin twenty two year old game minor issues pathfinding things expect sit back enjoy nostalgia superb game highly recommended good game im glad steam brought back age empires series im second generation playing nostalgia game reminds time everything simple sure ups downs like pathfinding man lot fun recommend almost fun rts game somehow managed make path finding worse babysit units constantly get stuck fun would give mixed review could amazing game full entertainment strategy enjoyable old game rts interesting period history single player campaigns fairly interesting assume good multiplayercalling remaster stretch though hotkeys largely rebindable completely units get stuck sometimes cant use waypoints noncombat units including villagers theres autosave whole game feels like year old game great years ago awesome like awesome last years basically age empires grew except prettier qol improvements dont expect different game loved original love one hated original well arent going like much better original small feat faithful original perhaps faithful pace game glacial somehow despite revamp glaring problems weird pathing issues victory conditions sometimes bit janky slow menus long loadtimes fun nice qol adjustments fun rts good aoede better p honestly good aoe whole franchise matter engine unpolished encountering many minor hiccups constantly games many gameplay elements intuitive great original version improvements like remember plus better graphics old cheats work sort thing like playing age empires back day complete cosmetic overhaul would hoped would fixed terrible ai pathfinding added ability zoom overall good first came really really fun like getting back closest possible time travelling like playing classic improved graphics slightly different gameplay mostly nostalgia driven instances ai doesnt work pathfinding well path lost nice game campaigns interesting history buff get like aoe sale must enjoying enjoyed old aoe expansion ofcourse want relive old days de beautiful soundtrack still rocks even better ideal enjoy pepperoni pizza favourite game commit troops battle sound game reminiscent childhood great return hope aoe de popular im viet nam firsttimerfriendly original poor pathing army number select limit really much like original memories good okay looks okay plays okaybut certainly didnt age well de aoe better around comfort features example also plays looks bit better even unless really want play game even historical setting id go one campaigns one also sorta boring trial error doesnt mean bad game dated like go get perfect pretty much original game one greatest rts games ever made said later games improved upon formula first game still good time really tough know make game nothing else definitive edition certainly true original point fault updated visuals impressive certain qualityoflife features like handy tooltips remind new veteran players alike buildings house upgrades welcome additionshowever feel quite strongly window dressing wasnt thing requiring update one major reasons hailed best series due large part wide variety strategic unit options available guiding fielding armies unit tactics put play definitive edition strikes something bizarre frustrating even seasoned player original imagine many newer players likely resort cheat codes clear campaign missions alltoofaithful retention games original ai cause units pathfind incorrectly around terrain features clump pause attacking target retreating losing units potentially entire missions ones inexperience incompetence rts player one thing likewise antiquated ai entirely anotherthats difficult recommend title stands one hand accustomed kind jank sort game back early nearly thirty years removed kinds software limitations acceptable ai pathfinding versatility unit tactics brought spec wouldnt issue heralding iteration worthy update original given game plays archaic fashion despite modern appearance surely drive away newer players players accustomed even cannot good faith recommend purchase anyone save diehard aoe fans regarded classic reason may ai modern games pathfinding bit dodgy battles end brawls matter choose deploy troops huge amounts fun upgrades make game compatible modern computers widescreen monitors work well played game lot early noughties still find enjoyable well challenging times better games want historical accuracy andor clever tactical warfare provide pleasure game id played dadvery nice remake way play old man expect throwback first aoe clean look everything else remains terms gameplay mechanics good game nostalgia graphics better original obviously still bad everything awkward clunky original except auto reseed farms whatnot micromanaging horrible ui doesnt help one bit tooltips displayed everything options see box tooltips located long takes appear really hoping something better also dislike sound effectsgrowing played game windows vista computer enjoyed lot getting used newer polished rts games isnt worth going back got old age empires discs dont work anymore getting de high hopes game somehow made worse prettier buggy choppy bad pathfinding ew hope polish real aoe lol played since original game created still love day games made far diablo xcom aoe years playing never get old year old game new graphics stale gameplay thing going nostalgia path finding bad turns game chore render tatics throwing units enemy usless might fun didnt age well good game always loved age empires games however one huge issue gets thumb mepopulation limitsi would thought updated hardware software surly god would need unit pop cap fun rts game build huge armys fling enemy campain unit pop cap means build army becuase course viliggers need gather resoursces also cost pop unit need lest villigers gather resourses need thumb game give thumb ever get rid game breaking unit caps great game theres nothing left say guess much better version great old classic nice game fun classic like chilhood nice update one favorite games brought back memories playing original game im glad didnt change whole lot besides graphics true rts fun replayable good looking game similarities successor however dont know would recommend others simply fact ai bit mess never played original tho try see websites may digital copies im guessing enemy ai didnt always gather together go player specificallyon easy modei enjoy playing game looking different civs tech trees feel like fixes game add replayability later line good remake original game gets keeps original gameplay elements improvements required adding idle villagers display making smart start working soon build storage pit automatic farm seeding expires things original version complaining path finding probably idea original games path finding probably spoiled aoe path finding expected aoe de didnt fps issues either may rare occasions one two times clue complaints coming guess mostly aoe played clue aoe expected aoe de advanced features aoe awesome barley worth playing nothing else cant build gates ether enemy keeps coming resorces run fast unlike age mythology ever fixed memory leak game making unplayable best age games besides better old one fun great game alive overall graphics good sound good old sounds remember campaigns like old version think upgraded interface inside old game pretty great worth buy many years game still one best rts good old game better wish remade aoe engine though ive played age empires past years ive loved games based era always id recommend everyone great timeless masterpiece loved game much back kid still love game day remember improved graphics highly recommend loved title first released modernised game play ai make great title revisit entertaining original fun remember still holds classic fun could go wrong good remember good back thenwololol good original even standard mode gives good challenge downloaded went
