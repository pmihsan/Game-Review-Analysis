available steam satisfactorily addressed previous complaints thank development team additional work went ahead bought second copy preferred platform quirky unit pathfinding game remaining complaint still much improved original grown franchise since childhood satisfied definitive edition remake game made fall love series hours egypt campaign zero technical issues nothing like read reviews ai seem bit stupid villagers run get stuck moving units en masse randomly take dumbest route possible wandering right danger instead direct path graphics great improvement even zoom little bit wish would added features like able put units formations wont stand anywhere close together makes planning battle bit clunky since move unit place individually definitely worth years tried play rts games reason lose interest minutes watching aoe de thought give ago whats worst could happen first tutorials moment surprised im actually enjoying aoe de never played aoe games cant compare versions iteven though havent even scratch surface game thought id review progress far im still get use game starting understand things better minutes pass bye seem bit addicted thought id never say rts style game reason

touchscreen best bet learn want prowhen launching game didnt audio quick fix search game runs flawlessly complaints best part game run game classic mode seeing old school visuals would say play friends enjoyable experience game never gets old played game kid still awesome playing age empires definitive edition reminded painfully original came years ago real time strategy genre massively matured timethe developers good job bringing audio visuals interface modern standard qualityoflife improvements theyve made make difference issue think one needed remake remaster lot let fly original isnt acceptable title produced twenty years later theres lot horrible broken balancing game silly little things like unable build gates walls youve built updating visuals audio crowd pleaser sure doesnt change fact age empires isnt good rts isnttldr youre popping old age empires cds youre buying new release dont think modernised enough really warrant plays exactly like originalfor better worse came expecting modern age game original setting youll disappointed came nostalgia youll happy resultmostly graphics excellent assets keep true original looking sharp detailed small things like roman scutum leaning wall barracks make models pop certain oddities original still remain however tiered hills well cheat units didnt receive facelift others dont expect hd version zug music also updated use actual instruments instead digital mixed result songs sound amazing end feeling wrong place fortunately playing custom game choose use classic graphics also uses classic sound effects music however remains updated version finally cinematicsand opening cinematic replaced something incredibly uninspired serves reminder ensemble wasnt involved overall though still enjoyable experience veteran player go back revisit began youre new havent experienced age series yet id wait age definitive edition november plays like original updated graphics plays similar original back graphics sound great upgrades pretty much game started tho units idiots cant make formations get around also far deadlier remember troops get quite bit done please play game good learn history poor pathfinding unrealistic ai game looks nice enough runs smoothly really gave nostalgia feelsthat said pathfinding units poor individual units move ok try move group forget itin addition ai ridiculously difficult mentioned reviews also dont like pop limit campaign missions wouldnt really recommend unless dirt cheap isnt worth pour faire simple cest une madeleine de proust qui la saveur avec un plus bel emballage un vrai remake fait par des pour des jeu est super beau mais souffre des que le jeu dorigine ce qui peut perturbant si est aux rts modernesun bon petit voyage dans le temps la campagne aux parties multijoueurs cependant sauf si vous voulez vous replonger dans les pretty cool come back long time aoe still
