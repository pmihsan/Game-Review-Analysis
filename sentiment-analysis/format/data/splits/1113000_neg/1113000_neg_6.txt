game artistically ways sole reminder games updated least little music normally mute music games listen spotify moment game opens rocked baller intro slides smoothly cascade bright colorful head bopping bangers redacted music hits story takes darker tone hits like truck performance ive read others complain stuttering bad framerate issues missing music freezing experienced none things playthrough run game maximum graphical fidelity would way consider game hard run ryzen super nothing top line game runs perfectly gameplay run dungeons cool themes ultimately executed poorly youve ever played pokemon dragon quest similar first fights slow things ramp quickly early feels like enemies weakness elements need hit make weak arent party yet dont add kenji party homie dips itll waste
