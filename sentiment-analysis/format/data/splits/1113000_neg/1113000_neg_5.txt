persona game buy teddie kill sleep smiling look persona legendary game golden let look intro hell happened mean didnt even bothered including original intro didnt pressed start main menu dont even get started main menu hell empty corridor gets filled characters instead get boring glitter filled purple main menu screen okay maybe im overreacting main menu game looks horrible reason played original persona side side original one looked waaay better reason cool ambient lighting got removed whatnot higher resolution graphics also damaged game since see low poly really huge letdownnow dont get wrong im still going finish see new content im sure small changes made worth removed nostalgia seriesget original version havent played get real experience look whats worth mostly good adaptation happy finally got play game things experienced playing game rather watching played however one glaring problem version suffers whenever animated cutscene plays audio visuals stutter constantly really take experience order actually watch mute game play cutscene phone huge problem desperately needs fixed look negative review comes qualifiers game good im enjoying although ive really gotten point actually opens lets play story interesting like combat world english vas good least less annoying japanese ones however marked glaring technical flaws im pretty sure come port game deals memory admit laptop basically potato years past retirement would expect run game fine actual game however constant audio stuttering freezing crashing cutscenes unnacceptable battle pc wouldnt work spaceship expect infinite loading screens forcing quit game might ok except theres autosave even manual dungeons expect playing hours idiots ported didnt think people cant afford computer looking cool jo wait fuck wrong game looking forward seeing kanji swimsuit question looks great even though tearing still tiny bit present even vsync expected really buy game youre looking challenge isnt first smt play hard love persona sadly cant play due constant random crashes horrible cutscene lag fix review negative otherwise great game cant recommend someone risk buying itedit changed positive recommendation every bug crash fixed part able flawlessly finish game thank patches love one major flaw change scenematics audio japanese dont subtitles either know japanese endure horrible english dub besides basically coherent story anime love controls pc hard get used game play noice love series moon atlus sega brought us unique mix slice life murder mystery dungeon crawler one go pick english japanese voice tracks solid port ps vitapraying sells well get games pc one buying love friendship selfdiscovery horrifying trauma inducing murders drag queen pageantswhats love loving every minute general note youve played persona recently youll likely notice ways evolved changes missed playing without way ruins experience persona easily difficult two games although sometimes comes result unexpectedly high damage spikes ive fights going perfectly well suddenly bop lol everyone died full hp uh im playing hard issue inconsistency probably problem normal far unmanageable still pleasant experienceatlus done excellent job porting game runs well least experience bugs technical issueshonestly thing really irritates game chies voice actress ideal far worst ive ever heard easily worst game might poor character fit actresses work isnt bad max marie adachi asap please beg yougreat game combat seriously gets old even easy made friends spent time family went fishing feed doggo studied exams went beach summer break became drag queen killed god better real life made forget dont actually friends irl man fucking hate game man game awesome played persona series since finished persona persona fes persona even personan skipped due availability playstation vita back since steam ive playing non stop last days keep coming atlus man killed vibethats wiggitywack yo man killed vibethats wiggitywack yo manly tears marie best saying otherwise masterpiece doubts masterpiece throw vita away dont need shit anymore masterpiecesupports dualshock issues maybe isnt bad boys trying solve murder case rise horny investigate might get better later hours absolutely idea game even really ive maybe battles total hours hours cutscenes dialogue thrust world map real guidance im supposed prioritise hard time based doom clock looming im totally lost real motivation experiment single playthough supposedly long soundtrack excellent voice acting seems pretty good im sure theres decent game one patience time models messed user error sound actual game anime bits shin megami tensei games please specifically strange journey dreams thoughgreat port far slight awkward audio issues battle
