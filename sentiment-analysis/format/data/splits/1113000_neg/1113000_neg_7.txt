yukikos boss playing blindly hard mode im sure youll fights get one hit never stood chance fight actually may plus people dont consider really bad feature preference normal difficulty boring progress normally grind much hard grind ready death social links personally hate social link system persona social links among investigation team suck exception kanji different reason ill discuss later usually end social link seen change character social links team match main story fact nothing thats considered optional effects story team social links effect story wasnt fact get tier persona helps combat id say avoid inconsistency social link story becomes apparent least kills lot makes story decent problem include side social links tho fact love social links side characters seeing characters around small town youre really makes setting feel small kinda like lived small neighborhood knew neighbors social links youll encounter actual problems people may come across life take away babying anime cliches topics actually nice characters family protagonist lives nice family going social links probably highlight game shows social links good however game sorta lacks gets way music music game amazing game really puts lot weight onto music entire playthrough never got sick single song soundtrack meshes really well environment different songs type weather condition rather cloudy bright sunny day music matches feel weather conditions perfectly battle music really nice even tho youll probably hear entire soundtrack wont get sick story love idea murder mystery small town something book wouldve read adolescence however story becomes much investigation morals revealing ones true self really starts suck starts underline good guy beat bad guy generic trope true ending persona golden

golden makes go ahhhhhhhhhhhhh good game dont see joker thought prequel persona see weird guy gray hair jokers dad saw akechi ryuji one else gives persona golden um verdadeiro jrpg seria em geral tem uma perfeita entre visualnovel e jrpg que quanto maior rank seu sociallink com os outros personagens mais fortes personas que criar te dando uma grande vantagem na parte jrpg jogo jogo transborda estilo e personalidade assim como os outros da serie e trilha sonora excelentea jogabilidade para sua batalha por turnos porem serie persona tem sistema de fraqueza nos inimigos em que se vc acertar os elementais certos vc ganha um turno mais e se todos os inimigos forem acertados com suas respectivas fraquezas jogador pode desferir um allout attack que causa dano massivo oponente normalmente eliminando inimigo na hora que faz combate ser mais interessante que os outros negativo jogo que ele vem com denuvo programa contra pirataria que um programa infame que pesa bastante computador e ate em maquinas com specs muito maiores que recomendado causa umas pequeninas travadinhas em certas partes realmente um milagre ver persona golden pc pois serie sempre foi ligada ao playstation e como ele vendeu bem tenho que veremos mais personas aki pcaltamente recomendado para de jrpg um verdadeiro que merece sua de um dos melhores jrpgs feitos persona golden theres reason well received virtually
