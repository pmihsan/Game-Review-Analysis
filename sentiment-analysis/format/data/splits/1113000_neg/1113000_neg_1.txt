next pesar que es un juego del es triste que su port haya llegado tardeme gusto mucho el juego muy diferente de los clasicos populares triple que hay en el mercado tiene sus dificultades de la vieja epoca tuve que tolerar la calidad del juego graficos guiones etc los personajes son unicos afectivos les agarras el gusto cada personajelo que le da mucho valor es la banda sonora tanto como el como el te absorbe la musica pesar que es repetitiva te cansas de escucharlopor supuesto como todo hay cosas que agradan del juego como ejemplo que te fuercen perder dias ver se entiende por lo que te quieren contar hacer enfasis que se va iniciar una nueva etapa mision pero creo que eso en el estas mas consciente de lo que va pasar pero sigue sin agradar que te obliguen perder diasme hubiera gustado mucho haber disfrutado de este juego en su momento ahora esperar el royal para horas bien invertidas en el juegomuy pocas partes con guia porque perdia real masterpiece havent bought played yet stop reading reviews go really great port persona biggest problems occasional crash playing dungeons hours losing progress extremely infuriating also problems end game cutscenes properly loading
