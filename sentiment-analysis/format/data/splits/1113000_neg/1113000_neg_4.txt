times complete disgust expressed without apology crossing defiance traditional gender roles dont get started homophobia bogged enjoyment game atlus still long way go also good remember older game traditional narrowminded idea society yes im bashing parts game still think good game prepared lot secondhand embarrassment frustration homophobia underlying whole game importantly remember every days great junes really recommend game really related real life theres many lesson could learn gamesry english bad recommend game people time enjoy reading stories even part sad storiesalthough main story great filled lot filler game dungeons boring although challenging hard first hours playing game became boring different lookthen visual novel part game great main story nice decisions scenes go dramatic comedy however social links part game mostly boring sad storiesbecause everything takes lot time lot loading screens even forcing story rushing takes shit ton timethe game needs variety comes tone social links scenes also needs option skip days forced go days without need regret nothing remember buying ps vita solely play game beating multiple occasions buy moment announced steam play good remember playing game ages ago couldnt resist playing saw steam unfortunately playing game didnt live nostalgic memory found game boring hours still feel extremely railroaded game top music repetitive dungeons literal hallways without much look fights dull eh okay game dull tastes guess spend time studying questions game test questions real life would let destroy grades spent hours finishing game

saw cartoonish scenery manga style characters thought id made bad mistake within minutes drawn characters story voice acting depth characters story great forget graphics strategic turn based combat also far immersive might imagine game sad finish really sorry leave sleepy village friends behind closest ive previously come kind immersive enjoyment video game dragon age origins many moons ago go ahead buy play give chance regret story telling masterpiece hype released steam still wait hot fix cut scenes tho worried would mess port runs like always meant pc controls odd keyboard youll get used pretty fast youll use controller went every twist spoiled still best one fuck atlus miss inaba end game never forget game even tried would buy waifus alone would die game im years old game almost made cry im bit frustrated seeing well game debatecom rig easily able run game game continues run horribly especially anime cutscenes would normally put bugs discussion section theres already many people complaining theres really point anymore atlus knows well us point extremely buggy port really taken little long bug fixing however still recommend game anyone finds little tech savvy theres probably trillion easy solutions im dealing im dumb know im man course didnt cry playing game lied naturally breathed im new persona player shit slaps im much rpg elements story great never much long text reading game changes great game dont buy im going find wish atlus would put persona games steam dont want buy playstation hate consoles im enjoying thought would tried playing years ago filtered hours long nothing happening opening get passed actually pretty good dungeon crawleralso yosuke sit permanently bench handsdown worst cringe inducing character video game ever made everytime opens stupid mouth want punch stupid face monitor lacks foresight ideas dumb ruins otherwise great group dynamic bad cant oppose every opportunity close thing punishment give im extremely disappointed lack joker joker super smash brothers ultimate reason bought game seen atlus thinking im going miss characters finish game im losing control im weeb swear im big writing reviews loved game heartpersona game introduced persona franchise cousin showed years back well anime immediately fell love unfortunately never unable finish persona due fact cousin live different states even running game emulator never managed get far game however came steam beyond ecstatic moment came cracked wallet bought playing game trip memory lane remembering shitty drawings yu narukami light blue dsi flipnotethe golden offers variety original introducing new activities well additional daysendings couple social links definite upgrade graphics game connects internet see players done particular day kind persona fused great function helped early ingame initiating social links theres also option japanese voices english subtitles theres nothing wrong english vas amazing actually nice change listen complaint would battle would occasional lag choosing magic attack bothersome early game bit slow due paragraphs dialogue tedious already know happensthe persona games considered standalone games wouldnt really matter started worked backwards individual stories characters unique personalities games drop subtle hints previous titles isnt much worry soundtracks golden sound bit repetitive due frequent use fucking slaplong story short playing game resurfaced love persona cant fucking stop thinking im gonna bother reviewing persona golden rather wanna say pc port definitive way playing beyond console ports based port come im couple hours right review game im seven hours shit heat im sad school life never cool im sorry teddie people human rights im spending high school years making envelopes eating spicy ramen oh something murders think ive ng original game times back roughly hours pissed updated rerelease golden released exclusively vita back never really wanted buy vita good thing patient enough never expected game come steam maybe lucky well get years year comes maybe even original persona innocent sineternal punishment toobonus point since game roughly decade old runs perfectly less year old nongaming laptop ive always wanted play game couldnt beat vanilla got stuck izanami fight wanted try game didnt driver desperately wanted play persona golden could experience definitive version game person golden actually drops pc please bring persona games pc clearly market il easily recommended game anyone ive barely touched jrpgs turnbased combat games ive never able stick hour two without
