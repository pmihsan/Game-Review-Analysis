also legend quest give something like instead make worthwhile find allsecond items make toggle switch one items zonelocked another makes starting zone level adjacent zones go level pr star rating becomes harder go away world centre tldr topthank time get cube world vanilla classic cuz current version shit version way better cant believe game scrapped make monstrosity game likely abandoned shell alpha cant even bothered writing proper review read others would avoid cost cant even kill snail right bat cash grab updates since release youve warned caveat start would say neutral review leaning towards recommend slightly cube world interesting game released years ago bought played lot completely forgot existence time surprising suddenly popped radar late august current state cube world poor still playable region lock interesting mechanic never seen wont say bad gear exists kinda extends gameplay feels bad man way make progress get gear clear zone suddenly unless weapon go back trash tier struggling kill greys greens tier mobs final kicker artifacts get completing zones might well exist due benefits give neigh useless two relics got play time stamina drain per second diving instead base unnoticeable lantern size increase honestly two things arent bad seem granted arent good mechanics really bad annoying honestly worst part game way gear weapon damage works play experience friends us alpha players water mages ranger water mages simply dont really care weapons much every class spam tornadoes lasers feet staves wands healing constantly racking combo counter much faster rate starter bow able compared ranger would get combo counter every second luckyone thing note going combo counter means everything miss even single hit resets unless weapon multi hit need graze enemy single hit keep rolling higher combo counter damage penetrate armor first hours gameplay found mage warrior rogue weapons single ranger weapon entire time time fighting purple mobs still wandering around starting weapon damage anything still glorified sand trap cool walked around group killed purple crab boss say maybe damage course boss health dropped gold boomerang suddenly even little else way gear could fight kill almost everything ease level power variance incredibly frustrating simply rely rng get upgrade maybe class maybe friends classes playing players add onto fact unless ranger struggle kill white mobs starting required get gear unless get carried get lucky farm ores craft weapon starting game horrible grind unrewarding straight fun clear first zone better even tho gear technically worthless unless piece still better geartldr review game good state could salvaged current state game recommend honesty one guys play said best group like dev took alpha stripped everything made fun adding depth puddle breadth ocean content factionsquesting eliminated progression threw outnever completed features teased years feels little scam release game state steamall even getting devs track record essentially putting something ditching years depending perspective almost complete lack communication fronts personally worried release real intention fixingcompleting game yet calling full release deletion bug report forms deletion dev blog deletion proposedplannedimplement dev build things shortly game went full release changed massively shown alpha negative wayregion locked gear means theres permanent progress artifacts almost bearingbiomes mostly samey youve visited game exhausted changed game played completely hate fact area need gather specific items equipment every new area resets back square levelsperksskills set stuff pretty upset classic example dont fix isnt broken clearly hype game massively undeserved disappointment clicker games less repetitive game shame really alpha highlighted potential game beta somehow took away added developers twitter also shown numerous things present game today think developer said fuck trying cash game comes back gives sad story releases game worse alpha make progression fun made unnecessarily difficult meet friends coming original alpha literally miles ahead today combat feels clunky difficult wrong reasons theres reason actively explore kill random enemies especially considering skills dont travel region region quests dont seem sense scaling sending death without real reason class skills strange real way understand without hunting guide absolutely patch notes upon updatesto honest dont even bother would say wait update obvious wollay taken money ran second time likely get refund update change broken game never come coming game blind trying experience first hand without playing beta make new players self seem confused whats going players randomly spawn world either waking town island forest objective leaving new players confused coming across first enemy near starting zone spawned youd think would low levels go attack outcome getting two shot themonce respawning already frustrated youve already killed something low level area deaths realise game level system monsters fight either grind gear lose interest due game feeling like rushed release hasnt even properly developed anyway opinion game communication stopped soon game released least twittercash grabperfectly designed steal money compared alpha shell game nothing enemies kill hits progression dont buy compared original alpha massive bugs anything thats windows feels slow dipped molasses npe speak quests direction interaction world anything plus really nice power trippy moderators bad time youve spent three years working game got regression im sorry wolfy unbidden thoughts matter complete disappointment everything loved alpha bought gone replaced broken progression system somehow worse world generation design baffles six years development game got worse complete utter boring piece game alpha greater thing see wollay goes hiding grows pair actually speak completely different game compared alpha huge disappointment year development timecontent gameplay teasers seen old system leveling replaced rng items region locking thinga baffling release par fallout mans sky core gameplay loop longer fun sense actual progression boring countless scrapped features regular bugs often drop game sub fpsevery region content different aesthetics beat one region youve experienced game credit devs working game whole time mentioned actual game hand great work ethic devs first look game great game breaking bugsexcept region block gameplay nice could repetetive game flaws like drop rate items looting sure shared almost hours lack actual progression facking region block items hello im willing look away rest flaws game fuck decided region block items game grind already stuff like boat glider even disappear region block ruined game skill tree region block fixed love game big nope ps fack region block cube world good minecraft bad cube world potential sadly final product unbalanced grindy mess punishes attempts progression cube world lot issues repetitive gameplay loop feeling basically completed game clearing first region since exploration heavily discouraged lose forms travel except hawks towns cost gold many people means grinding lot gold quick travel location location pointless crafting system generally downgraded townsthere pros game good combat system allows players experience fast paced combat ummmbut classes objectively better others take example mages player instance playing warrior absolutely bad time trying fight high level mages found dungeons bosses since mages high dps burst players long distances regardless armor level addition player gets knocked fire tornado theyre basically dead since cant heal knocked tornado likely stop channeling theyre dead mean time player watch spam hopefully dodge next attack get uprangers also good example good class possessing much burst damage mages rangers allowed get consecutive hits theyre enemy crazy amount damage plus bows boomerangs hit opponents multiple times means knock enemys relatively easyleveling also pointless since player get minor buffs movement speed glider speed boat speed increased amount light generated lanternall wouldnt recommend game fair share fun playing cube world around hours issues glaring overlook point im sick getting oneshot time mages cube world released worse progression system alpha state beta content downgrade alpha creator terrible communication problems havent sought community feedback year hiatus probably led sorry state releaseafter official release creator gone dark social media platforms againdo buy cube world game lot controversies ill disregard review ill look perspective new gamecube world exporation game rpg elements opinion people go wrong judge game say rpg game forget main genre exploration game game start bad starter equipment world enemy around corner defeat enemies gain better equipment get stronger lore game anything significant also lot things need improvement one level system gain exp killing enemies way level finding artifacts right artifacts help gain bit faster sailing hang gliding climbing etc speed many think inssufficient agree since equipment becomes almost useless entering new zoneregion start getting equipment system improved bit since right bit lacking defeat dungeons thing carries next region artifacts item symbol namebesides truly enjoy playing game even though flaws cannot expect flawless game right beta developer never done would highly recommend game easy way play friends since using friendlist steam need portforward use applications hamachi cube world game open world open world game suffers lack direction map progression desired rpg power curve map sprawling humongous procedurally generated like minecraft sheer size map daunting especially considering lack content pois points interestthe game suffers many problems ill try detail experienced almost hours game time playing cube map ugly useless towns arent easily identifiable neither shrines respawn points quest locations pois visibility map unnoticeable string colored text blends right colored map legibility main reason youd add map first place indecipherable useless begs question even added first loot gear tied zones sections map player kill mobs quests explore cave systems huge mistake imo isnt point open world enable players explore punish exploration tying loot zone developer must know players opt exploring means keeping hard earned upgrades right exploration progression working odds painfully bad design choice far im leftovers actually unidentified gear items didnt know already sold shop make room items small irk game piles onto rest problems make game unintelligible understand new levels removed favor gear progressing character power isnt big issue consider ever want explore outside starting zone essentially reverted new player wont carry anything like character level onto next zone theres much walking movement speed enhancing abilities little actually explore interact set monsters always seem drop coins matter star rating combat strength could kill star pig get coins kill star bone bull get coins wealth doesnt scale actually doesnt even matter towns useless money isnt actually thing games approach zones like new player spawns placed level zone must farm monsters quests area advance higher level zone lets say level sake argument youve progressed level zone encounter tougher enemies standard tried trusted rpg story progression cube world doesnt work like cube world start zone monsters every level moving another zone doesnt make easier harder arbitrary pointless unless simply want change scenery ambient music starting zone come across star pig handle easily come across like star alpha dog get destroyed illusion way outplay monster current item level confusing mess doesnt adhere fundamental standards rpg progression clearly suffers supposedly styled taking inspiration zelda havent seen hints puzzle aspect even considered game could maybe something climbing havent seen attempt incorporating puzzle forgotten cube world failed developer didnt like criticism likely going happen fool buying game suppose unsuspecting buyers warned game likely cash grab spend money wisely unlike cube world game expected explore massive world hang glide sail climb anywhere wantthe goodfast travel

seen despite lot progress demonstrated along lines early years game released steam different fact feel like created completely different personif developer stuck plan finished started review would likely different basis solid notthis bad game buy wasting money cube world voxelbased rpg thats currently second release public goal game create character choosing different classes explore different regions world get stronger region travel opportunities fight monsters complete dungeons craft new equipment explore variety regions game provides enjoyable played alpha release six years late comes disappointment considering direction game went little improvement addedgearbased progression region lockall games progression relies collecting gear region collect stronger weapons armor travel gear like boats hang gliders puzzlequest gear consisting different instruments miscellaneous things pets crafting books materials main goal region artifact artifacts ive seen cases first failure new system artifacts dont feel useful thing slightly buff things swimming sailing gliding speed something like strong lantern artifacts arent great item gives character massive buff overhaul second issue region lock system going new region causes weapons armor become worthless unless name even items work regions lose gear including hang glider boat etc didnt find terrible thought would region lock system wholly unsatisfying makes weaker instead ramping challenges rewards reasons go different regions exploration isnt fun due long takes travel without travel gear artifacts described earlier underwhelming would much better regions got harder rewards got better headed region lock gearunsatisfying combat character progressionits disappointing unnecessary combat considering smooth enemies fight exact ways exact drops every enemy excluding bosses drop coins random material pet food equipment etc reason fight enemy boring farming quests even worse theres longer xp system understandable gear progression systems would lot better gear provides main stats travel equipment xp would get skill points new improved abilities minor benefits like better speed travel reduction shop prices lack contentthe beta feels slightly less barebones alpha amount content considering cut alpha plans sixyear development period whats cut exactly spirit cubes alpha let buff weapons unique passives massive cities procedurallygenerated dungeons new abilities development period new classes races regions quests house building massive multiplayer servers pvp new types gear cut games original planbecause cut content lack backandforth communication community got twitter email response planned content current communication fine game came early access theres complete lack trust developers people fearing devs ghost accusing scamming people money ive seen lot negative thoughts im hopeful game keep getting developed improved considering plans change region lock system even add mod support dont think ill stay around developmenti received game bought alpha though means review doesnt count overall score game nevertheless whether buy cube world could know risk latter thing alpha look happened would recommend game current state due dull repetitive unsatisfying gameplay loop shame much wanted say great game think youre ok regionlock system means get maybe game isnt cube world exploration discovering

release wouldve ended happening even game slowly updated game complicated go back alpha jumping bandwagon people saying games bad go toxic somewhere else thats say disclosure buy game alpha live years ago week learn beta game went public cube world something waiting since beginning years finally announced excited see far come instead however weve given unfair game stupidly slow progression game expects explore better sitting town talking every single npc trying head dungeon low level getting wiped way randomly spawning enemies harder prepare cube world best example player feedback important early access games managed upset huge majority players addition exclusion rather controversial features addition planned features completely absent final product game manages jump pedestal drop dead ground leveling xp alpha days would get xp killing monsters leveling meant new skill points spend however like making skill stronger acquiring whole new one skill tree didnt many options advanced one plans never arrivedmeanwhile release cube world way get xp level finding regions artifact youll get slight bonus around random noncombat stat sailing speed gliding speed lantern strength etc also means skills unlocked beginning strength comes wear ill iterate bad decision later topic regionlocked items previously mentioned characters strength comes items wear interesting choice first glimpse youll soon wish wasnt case find equipment restricted land found exceptions addition regions size drastically reduced youll small playground use new hardearned yellow items enemies tiers zones size reduced b b supposed played separately enemies tiers white green blue purple yellow order means enemies crammed together might fighting whites yellows side combined fact youll also run wandering yellow enemies oneshot really shows bad decision progression get discuss games progression really takes said beforethere real progression earn completing zone meaningless bonus random stat youll access finding finding special item tied stat lack levels item regionlocking makes going new zone different creating whole new character conclusion bad decisions made hidden playerbase yearlong development period argue thats wollays vision game respect game promises sold us alpha players back additionally nothing really added aside procedural quest system new biomes advanced skill trees new classes building etcthe game huge potential making changes solely ideas consulting actual customers imply might get bad reviews game cube world never becoming strongest destroying everything path journey adventure exploring finding neat things people lost track vision alpha test never seen light day people pressured existencei like game give cube world item based progression xp difficult

accomplishing things every often cube world feels overly tedious accomplish anything kill thirty mobs get gold gear find npcs kill anything better gear score upgrade gear travelling slow boring much cause go attack wrong mob youre instantly dead walk distance unless lucky found one respawn shrines theyve honestly ruined good game changes cube world odd development history sure game came hiding confirmed final release date pleasantly surprised excitement slowly grew greater anticipated beta release date approachedwhen release came heard rumblings friends bewildering changes ultimately made game profoundly unpleasant reserved judgement could good long formulate opinions drastic turn design philosophy game took felt lot changes interesting wholly bad concept often compared game something akin zelda randomized run every given region new random run key items scattered strange far places ensuring ones progression given region wouldnt predictable pattern ultimately think concept could work well done way leaves players feeling punished daring truly explore game world could try speculate tweaks could change system better id rather focus experience ended deriving game endjumping idea progressing anew new region items collected first thing youre likely want find new gear strengthen character leads next probably important point gear meaningful time meaningless strength character largely determines level enemies successfully take wilderness gear ranked based rarity subsequent rarity different color whitegreenbluepurpleyellow overall gear score largely determines strength compared random enemies whose names correspond color system indicate strength possible take enemy higher level tier current character unlikely could take one two depending circumstances rhyme reason might encounter enemies simply strong fight means early spend time gingerly exploring hopes accidentally pulling enemy utterly destroy also means meaningful vertical progression game enemy yellow colored name comparable strength powerful end game bosses game throw youve killed enemy yellow health youve essentially conquered worst thing game throw making subsequent encounters enemies feel meaningless since youve already done hardest hard content topic meaninglessness enemies progress ranks power dont ever really differ characteristics abilities fight yellow named enemy largely identical fight white named enemy numbers simply higher nothing encourage adapt play style early game end game essentially identical different color slapped textaside gear progression main reason explore find bits ancient lore describing powerful ancient kingdom inhabited region world youve discovered pieces lore given kingdom location artifact item revealed aside however lore essentially meaningless lore largely consists vapid fragments factoids kingdom way determine relate anything might find observe around kingdom challenges might face endeavor acquire artifact possible encounter strong boss enemy name corresponding name discovered lore however uncertain based lore simply coincidence number preset names list random name generators smalloverall game entertaining hours however afterward may start dawn utterly meaningless unfulfilling game cube world really simple game run around talking people unlocking new areas killing everything areas claiming land cube world interesting game say least love fact region blocked gear however dont agree every region need gather special item example hand gliderboat get annoying third run artifact mechanic lot potential however useless since gives movement speed gives hp damage buff totally worth farming dont see point playing game except gonna explore different biomes taming pets gameit fun first regions gets somewhat pain worth playing first hours ill say time kill bad idea pick game cube world bad game sadly instead improvement got worse since alpha game calls actionrpg rpg progressions got removed replaced roguelike one time progress based solely gear valid region sort kingdom found inas soon cross border begining zerounlike games like dark souls skill matters however must farm gear every single region otherwise simple mobs kill quickly effectively punishing explorationwhile game states description combat skill based active dodge combo hits increasing damage truth paper reality stat realying heavy combat
