still ended functioning gameplay loopfind alpha want try cube world stay well away release even buying skyrim isecondi time first still much better investment sure alpha wasnt perfect game means developer would earnestly everyone favour replaced current build ill even change review bad hes opaque throughout games history effectively fully finished product updates happening year cube world ultimately dead water happened game playing friend learned every time leave region lose everything lost motivation continue wheres progression game better five years agowhat happen wollay actual fuck bro promised past six years wasnt delivered upon lack communication really killed game waited long without actually knowing waiting hate saying ill refunding wollay actually communicates properly community development going takes feedback point needed save game heard cube world excited play looked like enjoyable experience coming heard bad things wanted optimistic many problems game entertaining regionlocked gear leads incredible hindrance fun game walking new area immediately lose lot progress feels demeaning secondly enemies much damage barely scratch meanwhile even weakest kill hits feel good almost two hours played never encountered dungeon quests laughable best youre playing get feeling whats point finish area go new one start feel pointless repetitive grind end goal even real start point game starts thinking meant even guidance hell skilltree thing wich made character diffrent everyone really dont like change dont hate new version cube world prefer see old features make comebackif developers reading ask get rid region locking system go back old leveling system lot us want version back disappointing initially promised cube world still relatively fun game think replayability limited worst thing buy quite different alpha version release still enjoyable theres lots explore friends solo theres always challenging moments due progression system works nearly bad sounds playing game long stay one specific area great soon run things area decide move next youre met horrible thing thing progress items last area mean absolutely nothing newer areas game gets extremely repetitive first area game feels lackluster region locking mechanic seems getting criticism actually think biggest problem cube world progression rather gradually getting stronger leveled like alpha progression revolves entirely around gear meant first hours every enemy encountered would kill practically looking randomly happened upon yellow boomerangthe highest level proceeded destroy practically every enemy region way killing maybe got incredibly lucky seriously progression like switch flipped went weakest thing region strongestand completing first region cube world expects step another region start back square one except time lamp bit brighter joke bandaid solution think gear lost maybe half power instead entering new region could continue feel like character getting stronger rather rising falling power crossing completely arbitrary border content alpha years ago small see everything hours game spit regions main biome takes min cross one set types quests pieces equipment find hang glider boat improve mobility enemies one shoot begging cheesed actually kill hours barely killing random farm animals might get legendary weapon sweep legendary enemies another hour repetitive quests get piece legendary gear wont class way defeat dungeon clearing final boss legendary impossible beat even full legendary gear mage fry laser pointer seconds melee bosses exact ai cheesed vantage point cant hit else get one shot work get artifact boosts swim speed thats right reward completing dungeon region swim times faster ok lets try next region oh whats legendary gear utter trash weaker starting items pieces equipment found gone right start beginning trash gear equipment get keep new region swim speed theres clear tutorial exact questline encourages travelling around discovering new places collecting new gear old gear become useless game people upset lul make game worse stay away game development near perfect game needed content butchered horrible

see years waiting finally got game honest rather game years ago alpha version thiseverything world shot either get one shot almost every time need pull enemies allies job pray rngesus order give piece equipment piece equip still get shot throughout game time hardly anything since impossible kill mobs ones able kill dont even give xp anymore since removed xp game somehow manage kill something get anything means stuff suited class making put effort waste timeso literally prgoression character way improve instead need rely artifacts increase stats found random world need special equipment reach like glider manage get artifact hardly brings benefits gliding time swimming climbing useless gear aquire uregion locked u means literally useless move far away starting region gotta start scratch labeling recent accuired gear useless yes thing use another region far away restricted cant explore world would like switch another region also lose accuired gadgets like glider boat makes sense right another thing removing skill tree dont know game still called rpg moving around world tidious since travel time long need dodge enemies want move b die way goal respawn last shrine means must run way easily progression loss minutes frustrating yes might find shrines travel first find map might easy spot tutorial game yes understand dont need tutorial everything plan start game die wanna join
