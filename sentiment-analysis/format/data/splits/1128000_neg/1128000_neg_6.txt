ranged guys mindless melee guys behave exactly except special attacks use theres skill tree real customisation aside choosing class unique skills weapon type used class virtually nothing substance improved years might mean anything never played alpha make pause youre expecting continued support new features release largely empty elementary combat limited ability explore freely alpha supposed years cities houses much cut communication dev team days starting releasewhat shame last update message back september back another quiet hiatus meantime theres work done theres pressure community disappear lock away social media pressure cooker finally finished let preface saying regret money spent game years ago unfortunately however gamethere logical reason spend current state would feel bad

extremely disappointed direction game took new features well features removed years silence made game worse many people wasted money expecting something goodi played alpha cant really find anything really positive say game looks sounds nice feels somehow less complete alpha version years ago worst parts however followingthe map unique everyone gets preloaded world gets smacked somewhere random

zone sometimes cant find one need want hoursthey removed talent tree leveling system completely level tied artifacts find world artifacts things like increase swim speed gliding speed mounted speed diving stamina ect changing zones removes ability even use travel skills feels pretty uselessyou either absurdly overpowered due gear absurdly underpowered getting murdered things insignificant chicken bee especially picked meleeoverall made game feel like mindless chore want find items zone never ever leave zone exploration game pulled questionable crap many people making way worse really strange mechanics changed overall game exceptionally good many problems game beta mess compared alpha provided sense progression mixed regionlocked gear make overall poor experience definitely worth

recommend game current statesix years ago wollay released game potential six years later releases botched mess communication could write novel problems game right im going focus three things bother firstly world generation took giant step backwards absolutely reason compare worlds alpha beta try tell beta improvement secondly everything entirely counter productive everything regionlocked whats point even playing exp soon leave starting region everything reset id lenient could region literally cant even thirdly lack communication wollay disgusting case youre curious run game take notes guy taking peoples money going silent six years return resell even worse version game originally made go silent absolutely unacceptable guy didnt even tell us much game would cost guarantee wollay heard

majority negative reviews going say game nowhere original vision sold us im regrettably going tell people stay away mess good needs lot work devs disappear randomly likely never see finished gamei know early access means think finished game worsedont get baited steam sales current stateits empty dullregion locked gear gayquest markers need make sense bring back xp etc satisfied first hour play

rangeexploring places interest spot map chance doom whatever kill youprogression simply controlled game cant go challenge something stronger expect possible wini play see else hopefully wont leave game disappointed waiting years sure everyone hating game creator legit depression someone ruining beginning making worse telling bad game amazing game sure people want shit think would really boring like changed game gives us way things explore game wollay fav game even though took update still love bad game tho definitively worst developer ever pain begining till end dont recommended anyone played alpha really downgrade forget may enjoyable moment hack tool game changer make way enjoyable usual community may save game cube world promisededit hrs game kill bushes chickens kill pet animals cute worth current state repetitive gets boring fast worth much stuff missing regarding classes region lock system terrible punished exploring exploration heavy game really wish stuck alpha design worth playing worth buying dude spent years working itsupposedly time somehow made worse alpha game still unfinished feeling really bad designs lifeless endless world little mean repetitive content spread long walks obvious flaws even going yeah fell dead meme nostalgia abandoned dev wanted make quick buck maybe modding community make enjoyable idk probably message wollay hope make good use scam money worth wait money huge mistake actually buy game much faith game sad see become nothing save cube world even mod creators god bless hearts cant undo shit game poorly optimized boring grindy goal nothing gives deeper satisfaction staring deeply eyes lover getting one knee pulling ring abandoning game spent years working leaving games community goodbyeunfinished nothing like alpha mobs destroy one two hits gear items become useless change zones giving zero sense progression direction game quests sense purpose wander around aimlessly avoiding mobs cause unkillable really wanted like game sadly went weird direction nothing like expected tons performance issues crashes horrible gameplay id rather play old version pile fucking trash thanks game fine personally think game taken steps backwards alpha leveling feels kind pointless power purely based gear big issue lies find gear used zone found exceptions permanent fix know pretty much games loop kill things dungeonsquests get gear big dungeon artifact end artifacts give level boost one moment options climb speed diving time etc zones two three artifacts time time finish everything zone moment move next area gear degrades tools boat hang glider magic instruments etc taken away basically instead progression game straight diagonal line goes get gear level explore goes moment leave zone drops back repeats know way getting gear last forever matter well argue makes gear feel meaningful youre constantly replacing cool get gear also feature lets put blocks weapons make stronger customize cool kind waste cant keep weapons multiple levels ok youll fine feels like infinite hamster wheel im going anywhere gameplay aside experience playing game couple hours friend something wrong ai npc running walls sprinting away youre trying talk pets anything randomly springing circles worst half time enemies dont react attacked sit nothing kill idk widespread issue friend experienced constantly thought session game wouldnt recommend someone current state someone bought way back sat six years almost nothing im little disappointed result glad wollay actually released something let lesson buying games finished knew six years ago cube world would end becoming wouldnt bought oofdiesat least um make nonactivated death shrines visible map oh cube world long waited say im enjoying time game combat fun enjoy new mobs factions extra pets put smile face however cube world isnt perfect personally three major gripes ill explain later say havent found artifact yet havent leveled say believe cube world worth purchase want get friends wait release believe issues game likely turn away newcomersprosi personally think game looks charming voxel based models environments giving unique look especially like enemies defeated break individual blocksthe combat fun standard action rpg look enemy attack able move classes ive tried berserker guardian warrior flame mage assassin rogue default archer enjoyable specials beat enemies difficulty choose right creatures attack story individual quests random encounters keep player engaged also multiple monsters around small groups really enjoy combat shortage indulge hearts content friendsconsin starting area levels monsters appear completely new decked basic gear monster requires purple gear beat knocks lights outi found guardian specialization boring difficult use single player yes realize guardian water mage specs multiplayer someone wanted see would enjoy playing friends found bit poor impression cannot speak water mage personally without adding new ability spec dont know one could make work singleplayer since current special ability heroic shout supposed taunts enemies makes aggro onto warrior allowing allies take overall would say group guardian warrior use youre better berserker warriorthis major issue time far believe biggest factor newcomer staying game leaving explain game map map zones inside zones individual dungeons quests towns etc find hang gliders boats climbing shoes harnesses order move around quicker also items allow one access areas either locked otherwise inaccessible normal means divine harp spirit bell sky whistle might ones ive found adventures issue leave zone lose items since theyre tied zone youre say youre traveling boat across ocean pass another zone since part ocean happens boat gone reenter original zone wanna continue journey swim manually hang glider youll drop sky cross boundaries using climbing boots allow scale environment without using stamina personally think current system works fine items unlock certain areas also subject system cannot used new zones also find acceptable since gives players another incentive explore new zone questing however find losing ability enhanced travel unacceptable would prefer boats harnesses hang gliders individual items one could find buy quests zone player find stay although think could rarer since believe fair exchange would quests would give transportation options added benefits speed less stamina usage similar armorgear remember correctly gear rarer used alpha im fine im fine gear also tied zone system leave zone found gear said gear stats lowered effectively giving starting gear understand concept behind since every zone almost self contained area makes sense weaker enter else challenge game lost believe wrong way things believe system instead scale current gear level zone youre scaling smaller increments allow player see power increase current zone travel outside zones still strong wont steamroll everything enemies stronger outside also drop stronger gear even lower quality continues advancement player without making feel stupidly weak multiplayer believe zones could scaled depending many players zone time players average gear level idea ideas possible im loathe criticize without coming possible solutionsartifactsafter approximately hours found first artifact say im little disappointed get ill give overview artifacts give passive ability increase random stat ive read mine gives passive increase sailing speednow paper thats fine would ok wasnt fact boats bound zones leave zone im artifact useless find new boat wanted go ocean zone could take long time due slowness normal swim speed gripes artifacts least one easily alleviated making methods transportation locked zones stated abovebugsive found two far one music wont loop correctly im left ambiencethe change keybinds binding dodge g key exit reenter game keybinds reset defaultsside notesthese observations ive major enough put pros consi find nighttime dark since barely see front even lantern think current darkness level works gaves unlit interiors outside believe needs brighter notorious bad eyesight swear hard find statues life around map know unique structure always seem stumble upon accident maybe make map icon look different im surewhen first make character dropped world near statue life environment nearby random think fine

minute walk unless changes im sorry cant recommend game want cant ok ive looking forwards getting play game ever since yogscast made video years years finally come exact state beta mean whats stopping everyone playing beta right theres news theres going continued updates currently cannot recommend opinion may change depending direction decide take game ok woolay really didnt want love cube world game game become way difficult startfirst critique world generation original alpha back cube world launcher everything could make world go fight enemies level wanted fight higher level enemy find canyon delve dungeon search loot try dive ocean beat guppies whatever case fun gave lot look forward first starting original cube world alpha generation game well horrible linking world creation single player stupid first try character named mrpurplehoops decided rogue city spawned flipping island bridge island close mainland swam shore seriously dude island kept getting mauled death like repeatedly first running boom dead boom dead like times within seconds even one enemy kill second character warrior named cilan didnt different experience ill honest kept getting one shotted characters around town thankfully mainland time seriously dude hell dude people waiting years make harder veteran players return game new character everything muff world gen badly makes sadly worth playing spend friggin dollars thought would trip nostalgia lane instead bloody waste time energy fix terrain gen make cities spawn center zone lowlevel zone make zonesareas spawn harder way wont die get fucking xp game worth spending freaking dollars dont ignore us woolay fix bloody game hand someone listen youll go buisiness okok lied everything okay hell happened game fps severely tanked since alpha going less fps alphas windows support doesnt exist fans already made unofficial patch fog still likes devour entire planet every progression even worse game current state surprisingly worse alpha years inferior version happened seriously okay lemme get straight much game managed really good launched managed become legit utter shit ill leave opinion hereif youre reading review probably read around right idea whats happening game actually cool useful level ups got changed artifacts well played minutes didnt even really get close get artifact could make sure could get refund backpretty much everything kills fuggin seconds game hell nearly died damm cow cow well didnt enough patience see gear invalidated changing regions literally sold gear one staff wasnt enough damage kill countless hp monsters stayed wayfinal thoughts youre way better buying game state even game even gets better day maybe someone extremely hyped play cube world getting real taste game doesnt really feel worth use bucks something spent buy another game period old alpha player heregame levels skill tree things changed hours playing friend dont feel boredmaybe bejust play ur friendo everything fineand pet dog upon time cube world filled promise allure fast forward decade fallen flat square one biggest disappointments video games ive ever witness essentially mans sky wollay doesnt understand made game good originally instead building upon foundation alpha instead got dollar store breath wild ive played hours least half time spent talking shit game friend play garbage seriously cant imagine playing hours game runs steam incredibly quickly youll soon discover much copy pasted content wish wasnt game awful cant recommend one worst cash grabs history pc essentially crowdfunded personal video game refuses release properly people paid since day one would expect beta improvement alpha version yet see game become much worse transition transition incredibly wollay butchered game downside practically restart every new zone good thing game right bought back dont pay find shit thing game die progress progress locked region way actually able kill anything going mage see everything screwed people already commented disastrous game design game im going stress another point really think developer left game alpha years without single update commenting twitter year showcase something day max deserves receive support think reward terrible behavior towards people decided put faith himalso review isnt getting counted steam im one people actually supported development since beginning years since alpha game got worse better truth game probably even worked continuously years current state game feels like months work rather years lack work also bad game design decisions region locked gear worst one kills sense progression game thing keep regions shitty artifact stats boring things like swimming speed combat actually less complex satisfying full release alpha wollay said working subclasses class skills skills actually removed instead many examples regression like really excited game back dont want say worth buying thats truth hyped exaggerated devs abandoned game many years ago im sure people expected release seems devs reappearing cash much changed alpha six years ago worse state remains shards fun game lost timeby removing xp system skill system making gear useless outside zone find game evokes nothing nostalgia overall low quality inferior alpha itdisappointed game purchased long ago enjoyed much turned something would never playgood ideas executed poorly crapremoved features blah blah blah youve already heard allfuck game overall disappointment years development youre willing look past fact decent game overall game good greatthe progression system allows zone feel like fresh start lack long term progression makes hard work zone feel pointlessthe combat good imbalance levels enemies makes toss whether encounter result getting oneshot oneshotting enemiesexploration game shines plenty unique places discover plenty cool sights seeoverall game good improvements progression could great overpowered enemies everywhere difficult slow leveling via artefacts rather exp gain ridiculous distances cross get anywhere little way except dodging enemies probably one shot repetitive quests annoying mechanics boats gliders equipment rideable pets locked specific regions taken away cross another region forcing grind anewfeels like huge downgrade beta terms fun playability dont recommend gameplay improved owned since alpha somehow game lost charm wollay point alphabeta masses test game tell pros cons play years shit alpha version fun honestly ptbrcomprei jogo pois havia jogado alpha jogo era maravilhoso mas ir para beta ficou acabaram com sistema de level sistema de equipamentos ficou se tornou um jogo e sem posso dar umas para criador jogo ele deveria ter mantido sistema rpg antigo game e acrescentados algumas carateristas atuais e ter deixado os equipamentos plus como permitido mundo inteiro game alem de poder alterar os sufixo dos mesmos equip exemplo sufixo druid para silver sacrificando equipamento que tenha aquele sufixo isso tornaria os equipamentos plus mantendo item drop dos mesmopois se ficar muito perde valor dos mesmosengi bought game played alpha game wonderful going beta horrible ended level system equipment system horrible become simple bland gameif give suggestions games creator kept old rpg system game added current charactersand left plus equipment allowed entire game world addition able change suffixes equip example druid suffix silver sacrificing equipment suffix would make plus equipment unique keeping drop item becomes easy loses value paid like back wait
