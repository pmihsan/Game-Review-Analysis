everything map since alot missing features alpha one examples weapon upgrades cubes could upgrade weapon damage stats change abit look class balance classes really easy start classes bad quests even artifacts bad stats feature nice flying points speed traveling even exploration aspect fog edventure aspect dungeons artifacts even stats bad looking think version npcs alpha bought years agoits worse bought game years agoa lot features planned showed website like housing pvp skills every class races multiplayerand useless game without feeling progression artifacts fucking useless skill treeshonnestly game scam wollay removed everything planned website really changed mind evolution cube world didnt paid game nowi passed didnt want think game bad give bought game play friends mine told lot fun started playing quickly realised game barely fun barely anything except combat combat way repeating never anything new exciting game would recommend bought game back first came unlocked steam better steam release even unfinished state developer totally abandoned game abandoned years ago put steam quick cash grab abandoned stay away bought game returned found region locking found doc keys game got freeand matter much wollay fucked player base insult disguised game still got free gets technical thumbs imagine laughing cause game joke bought game euros like years ago blast playing exploring leveling becoming stronger greati contacted creators cuzz lost files since got new pc amazing enough send steam key thank thatnow lets talk dont like gamethere goal choose class youre town collect apples mushrooms cook food kill cows running around exploring constantly killed everything ive figured colors indicate strength found items shrines idea discription open wiki play game thats poor game designwhere level system go kill weak enemies get fragments turn armor cool decent armor get instead oneshot enemies ever beat progress indicator direction apparently need find item progress next area start thats way level looking find tamed lemon beetle cant ride anymore since bought apparently need item ride short give direction tutorial ill keep getting frustrated able anything wandering goal mind bought game alpha leveling system reason explore world even didnt lot quests things fast forward years later game comes beta quests reason explore fight anything actually punishes going outside playpeni much rather would preferred alpha betas quests cube worlds release feels like less content alpha bought game first released way back alpha stage ive spent hundreds hours old version hurts say release version isnt nearly enjoyable hoped would main issue stands region locking upgrades gear special items seem unusable cross border new territory forcing restart time hurts game way much exploring new zone horrible losing special items worked towards getting found jumping cliffs expecting use hang glider fall straight group enemies leveling seems thing even though character stated level equipment menu health arbitrarily went went new zone dropped back starting levels im assuming tied equipment another reason thats infuriating remember back alpha bit progression character life cant find anymore exists seems really hiddenbuggy ive ran several annoying bugs game one making starting zone absolutely drag first thing arriving town first time losing fights enemies near go general goods vendor instead offering normal things marked enemy attacked sight knowing vendor fought back killed longer respawn lead try explore regions next starting ones new towns met issues another glitch ive experience minor deals terrain generation would put things like lore spots books shrines floating voids pretty much unreachable new enemies lacking older features remember gameplay feels solid moving fun climbing jumping paragliding combat passable works boring dealing high health enemies respawn points incredibly annoying especially factor annoying region locking spawn point right next area fighting happens another zone instead chooses respawn halfway across map one region currently lead minute travel times attempt boss might kill frustrating close game amazingit really sucks cant recommend spent much time back alpha stage hoping would continue path seemed main issue region locking removed could honestly recommend price much fun get spending time friends honestly played bought alpha god damn bad pure dogshit brought game years ago experienced alpha version lot going enjoyed lot updates came haltnow finally comes everything mostly knew game gone stripdown version beloved alpha friend went finding sorts things removed original alpha version finally killed region itemlock systemafter checking see attention would seem hasnt response developers lack communication helping game allhonestly alpha version needs come back badly least didnt pay game twice cannot recommend game current released formits fun saw tooth progression repetitive little gain playingits hard start region get yellow weapon suddenly piss easy note gear necessary either hard easy cannot recommend game current state buggy game crashes constantly talking npcs quick example theres lot game honest early game brutally punishing finally come across first piece equipment steam roll almost every enemy come across mage enemy equal higher level require cheese finally manage find everything area rewarded form progression game currently buff useless stat never use idea get buff diving speed considering theres reason ever dive begin dont necessarily hate idea region locked equipment starting area current state terriblealso bought game back alpha hoping get refined version product instead given completely different genre game cannot recommend game could completely different direction developer would listened feedback engaged discussion updated regularly instead users given silent treatment result worst game years ago changed review negative purely devs cash grab ethics support seems dropped game moment released could write fairly detailed review pros cons linear progression vs horizontal progression everyone already covered feel say youre considering buying keep mind dev kept contact community years releasing paid alpha made meaningful changes game years biggest insult feel impression early access release surprised find dev honestly considers completed game rough beta remarkable step back content compared alpha offeredi feel bad dev levels seems generally anxious worked job developing game dream project excuse asking money ghosting people

recommend game againhave good day passion game captive inside last six years always optimistic rushed game forever bad somehow though game feels like less content alpha hate say happens cut community feedback create large game one ensure quality game still potential reputation damaged game incredible world generation lore fundamental design flaws core gameplay loop issues get addressed game get boring completing single region hyped game playing since im waiting makes upset confused pissedhere thoughts also tldr bottom also played way hours ton account bought brother beaten regions far characters legendries one regionwolly wants game exploration game core isnt finding gear kill things stronger get gear end finding artifact problem exp legendary purple gear reason kill lower ranking enemies get nothing rewarding besides like food ingredients think removing exp system made want kill lower enemies biome feels lame explore im wandering around region see openness nothing else since enemies higher rarity run away barely kill game becomes one huge fetch n quest spamming alt think wolly make want explore cool structures massive dungeons better towns better environment basically make map look interesting biome also sort unique environment player could interact deal like raining mana tree something desert storm feel like biomes life barren everything looks enemies also appear often imo already said removing xp system also removing skill tree feels weird horrible design choice miss able lvl also shaping character way want via skill trees think could solve adding skill master town biome learn new techniques character choose layout damn skill tree region lock one bafflingworst ideas ever want explore explore im told already beat regions rewarding slightest get beating region getting stupid artifact increases lamp radious regions damn small fact gear becomes trash next region terrible weapon scaling game imo horrible got really lucky good weapon weapon made destroy everything around making challenge less rewarding reason like lvl scale enemies lvl still make game hard game rgn luckbased loot system know loot tracker sometimes doesnt even work get gear classes think wollay add gearbased regions like desert get cool desert looking armor gives player unique passive region way gear bound armor fun way think also think would cool player collected couple certain artifacts around regions made ascend spirit relm whole new biome difficult doesnt make current gear awful traverse place fight final boss incredibly hard boss get amazing gear passives skills also needs add classes stuff atm farm arena lot wrong game especially removing much alpha use way back machine picroma website see much slap face really much taken added tldr game feels slow lack progression without exp skill trees make want explore via cool looking land locations make biomes interactive type region lock imo bad let keep gear fix stupid weapon scaling add interesting gear related biome passives new area get via special artifacts add classes stuff planned originally waiting quite get hold game friends recommended every damn time played refuse accept idea isnt worth short time less hour fantastic hard start dont dislike games matter case point difficult start difficult let greatest teacher waiting game since wasnt expecting much wanted game little bit fun little

years ago liked betteri loved able wander endlessly world without worrying going get utterly demolished patrol doomlazer wielding mages loved hopping boat going new land alpha youre stuck small space limited quests get geared items equipment go next zone worthless going new zone boat think wanted glide cliff surprise youre new zone warning whatsoever plummeting death gear magically disappears new zone understand wanting people power game day dont lock zone size eyeball want stay powerful worked hard call rewarding grind every time want explore vast world boasted description alpha felt rounded current release current release missing important functions like player way points party function absolutely loathe idea grinding gear every time enter new zone especially equipment get boat one zone water doesnt end use boat im saying horrible game im saying wouldnt recommend current state least make zones bigger wollay please played alpha didnt problems playing game could level easily kept items rip game ill see yall years cube universe played closed beta though didnt put many hours others thats completing one zone aka region reason want venture got upgrades transportation speed minor collecting relics reading others feedback lamplight seriously ever get upgraded lose modes transportation soon leave zones boarder find anyways slow first time around gear progression fine rough start gets better craft obtain armour survive encounters start killing mobs loose quality well cross another zone max tier yellow star sword example becomes white zone one got attack power dies basic white tier weapons level strengthi know yes items end name exist rare come also chance youre going receive item class isnt even becomes utterly useless youall think biggest issue game right region locked modes transportation shouldnt find another boat glider ect shove pocket travel another region thema lot people explain much depth please check reviews well played minutes couldnt kill single thing game balanced designed well im going waste free time played alpha six years ago followed wollay six years let game used small grind small grind nothing truly adding disappointing wish could alpha back played alpha long time ago kinda enjoyed itthe steam release howeverpros races distinct different eagle fly infinite distance increasing pricecons basically everything grinding starts enter new region deadly gear worthless outside region quests different races different appearance racial tutorial guess needcan broken time lags even decent connection chat working gear grinded obviously doesnt work travel friend thousands kilometers awayalpha nice steam version worse many ways happened devs shot leg one played crap game like years ago developer wolly didnt update game last year september updated game worse alpha didnt know possible leveling character progression screwed dont buy game developer run away money played game alpha spent hours playing mates getting gear leveling skills leveling mechanic gear get cannot used biome work put one biome completely useless next played game lot alpha first came even though wasnt lot content could see lot potential spent hours friends finding new pets leveling finding cool new gear version took almost fun game levels traditional sense gone stats based gear leave region youre gear becomes extremely powered grind new gear extremely strong enemies scattered map right next weak enemies youre going die lot exploring somehow seems even less older games grinding new stuff becomes boring tedious knowing youre going restart lose everything want move ontldr game somehow even less first released dont bother playing unless leveling gear system changed played game refunded wasnt expectedit cool see new content weapons find region basically become useless another region annoying get weapon go another region u already done every quest stuff efforts basically vein weapon weakit also annoying basically ignore every enemy see attacked probably die except mage mages basically destroy anything enough skill takes away challenge mean mages fire missles much damage basically defeat anything u run away enough wait missles fire note always damage enemys missles even gold enemysthe point im trying make game lost charm opinionheres quick recap basically want saythe game boring magethe game boring u cant fight anything meele charactersthe game annoying basically lose weapons go new regionsthe game becomes grindy artifacts bonuses dont amount anything note havent found artifacts dont know give heard basically suckthe special items find dont stick boats gliders etcwater mages bad alone good othersmeele characters suck everything strongand many things im lazy list played game little enjoyed changes repetitive content made incredibly boring lack real progression game makes problem worse able level grind would add extra dimension game least instead restart region aside rare gear also transportation items stripped change regions makes artifacts feel completely useless nearly finish region even though multiple biomes game dont feel different enough dungeons essentially causing feel like palette change rather actually different biome though add dark forest biome bit interesting restthe combat excellent simple fun simplicity leveling leveled gear different levels itin conclusion game could turned horrendous development cycle helped strip parts game many early adopters game loved played game much back alpha birthday days ago say hell birthday present wolfram crazy son bitch actually thank muchcomparing game minecraft feels like null point like bringing terraria even surface level game open world rpg god great actually forgot much missed absolutely brilliant perspective someone played absolute hell pre alpha game fundamentally solid framework needed content doesnt take long see longer issue played game years ago missed game much played originally several years back happy see come onto steamits really casual game want play friends hop since gear doesnt really traverse regions doesnt matter levels differenti found really hard start kept getting killed understanding things work also spawned away townif youre struggling lot easier someone else joins definitely first thing head town talk many npcs possible purchased game years ago originally decent rpg game since alpha release following features removedskill treesa experience based leveling systempermanent equipment itemsif confused last one allow explain region locking system game starters levels increase stats find new

instantly want kill mobsinstead complaining ill offer solutionswhen youre making character world allow us pick progression system oldschool mobs quests give xpexploration artifacts give xpinbetween mobs give xp artifacts give quest rewardlike xpit feels like youre rewarded anything running around right combat thats case dont want grind mobs purely drop leftovers chance related classthats even entire problem either combat feels like things either exponentially better weaker could kill white green mobs put fair fight warrior water mage instantly healing back full took damage blue mobs literally took damage wouldnt even try anything higher exponential power growth opinion bad system either stomp get stomped getting gear im sure white would put fight well game works remember putting much time playing game cant speak balanced back remember warrior harder play water mage hours struggling want keep playing warrior could easily kill groups white green mobs standing groups aiming outhealing damage splashing themi know wollay work game passion project hopefully hell iron balance issues give us options xp hopefully put skill tree back inbut right cannot recommend game really
