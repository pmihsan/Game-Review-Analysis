recommend game anyone likes levelling character progression exploration combat mind numbing loot grinder majority loot becomes worthlessnon existant cross imaginary border game amazing potential ruined ill keep checking time time see gets fixed moment avoid like plague waited six years game loved alpha version cant give version good review took exp leveling game hard enough beginning low level enemies fight level one alpha still low level enemies cant even grind exp enemies lower level instead everything beats plenty enemies one shot also theres combat healing besides potions making food wasnt much problem pick heart plants plentiful make like hundred pots time feels like incredibly scarce mention cant explore ten feet without running monster one shot mentioned didnt even play much game reviews ive read claim gear even resets region hard enough try grind grind gear exp gain fucking every time travel far two fun aspects game used exploring biomes fighting cool looking random enemies bosses theres reason either things new version game encourages avoiding every fight thats quest dungeon boss dont get game alpha version available back felt like complete game many people never know cant buy version anymore waited six years items region locked lose exp system many concerns people saidplease read cube world reddit explain problems waited six years play game disappointed many unnecessary annoying systems weak multiplayer servers reset items changing biomu skill tree searching strength biomes one region every npc give location new classes races water wizard oneman army cant kill heals attacks time asterisk system could old leveling system saw making progress hidden artifacts game system artifacts unlock example going boxsuch artifacts could hidden cool harp used open dungeons bit overkill currently stars attack defense probably outbound entire region times find artifact terribly annoying mechanic stops fun new monsters new artifacts flute unlocking spawnpoints etcin opinion game worth price pln someone really wants play cube world let find game years ago much better waited release post review introduction bought alpha years ago fun itive played around hours betathe first hours terrible everythings kill game doesnt tell anything need relay external sources time im wrinting review scarce progression changed level progression item based progression bad progression well made instead skill level unlock everything start gear divided rarity normal legendary mobs youll encounter killing mobs certain rarity drop items rarity level bosses quests give items rarity level aboveother normal gear find special items artifactsspecial items glider reins boat allow faster way travelling spirit bell divine harp sky flute allow access secret areas either one item goldartifacts honestly disappointing thing game bonus give virtually nonexistent combat related certanly worth grind locked behind region locking artifacts everything find region locked youll lose changing region meaning basically starting scratch every time cross border losing gear special items kinda understand gear reset special items carry since couple regions starts getting chore getting backthere special gears end name carry adjacent regions pretty rare finding rare item pretty difficult combat ill start saying game internal documentation classes skills meaning discorver workthere classes specializzations ive played warrior mage speak combat style pretty shallow either face tank lifesteal enemy deal warrior run around attack enemy knocked mage enemies lot model differs youll start noticing different kind combat theyll use mimicking classes meaning youll quickly learn deal combat become either mindless mash buttons good gear certain death dont personal skill wont make difference exploration world gen lore region locking basically gut exploration procedural world gen pretty good get boring pretty quickly given gamelay loop really rewarding ive seen different biomes far clearly different point interest youll find pretty much sameas lore nonexistant read tablets give random info guys kingdoms dont really care given zero context reasons care times tell location npcs quests jorney youll find plenty bands npc adventurers talk might give quests quests mean save trader gnome x monsters get crafting book x monsters kill boss monster thing annoying lack variety time comment appearance like hand glidenpcs might also give locations special items pretty usefull since said time give random comment also reliable method finding items conclusion cubeworld promising game years developing worst state alpha im saddened alpha great starting point needed content wollay even showed twitter reason chose discard left full release im hoping updates make modify review want game good really dobut six years silent development coming back state im holding hopelevelling removed skills removed game actively punishes exploring locking gear youve earned theres little effort put sort combat balancing world isnt even randomly generated anymore seed fixed youre dumped random spoti cant even see anything would taken six years add game largely anything entertaining removed actual exploration replaced one tediously dull gameplay loops ever devisedmaybe one day wollay come back full release actually took player feedback board seriously doubt though want like game really held special place childhood excitement immeasurable saw announcement hell even upgraded computer windows play friends im sad say let bad game whats whats removing exp skill tree gargantuan mistake made grind worth finally level get new powerful skill even point killing anything quest monsters dungeon monsters everything else waste time health region locking cant even begin describe awful hard work grinding gone know stepped invisible line grind even harder get items guess work region neighbouring regions thats nothing permanent except pets lose ability ride step invisible line point anything nothing matters temporary hard work rewarded saddening wake reality game crashing burning simply cant pretend okay special really rubbed salt wound ever since massive storm hatred hit game main developer gone away could understand first time sure okay anymore absolutely coming cash grab scam rate get one likes sent constant hate mail always going people like others

announcement release counting days could finally play early beta reviews started come concerned hear rpg levelling aspects taken backseat make way repetitive system resets progression areaafter dropping game made character began try joining friends impressively confusing system join friend seemingly nothing happens eventually realised world thousands kilometers away also eventually also realised use eagle get mean menus gameplay unintuitive confusingat point lost one friend couldnt deal intense lag felt towns took long time figure trying duel wield sword shield worked restarted ok theres bugs performance issues tooso together last set quests first things could basic fetch quests required us trying get away level squirrels long enough pick glider things could kill along way didnt seem drop anything interesting apart bow weapon none use could use thing go get harp promptly killed random high level enemies near harp location figured something going repeat next area werent going enjoy progression system added game could still claim refund bailedi didnt go game hoping give negative review game ive wanted since childhood sceptical given games previous years history lack thereof ultimately feel game one recommend one ive felt needed refundedits impossible know whether game updated future becomes polished fun product im willing give second chance future given waited years got entirely different game hardly features teased developer little communication community dont much hopeits shame game turned way cant surprised game changed entirely isolation without chance feedback ive following cube world years game introduced love voxel gamesi bought twice game alpha also played heck itthat said wollay finallyafter disappearing years without keeping promise update game announced release steam quite excited even though ive lost hope point joined beta honest extremly disappointed took everything exciting picroma website roadmap still said would additions skill system gone replaced region lock including much needed glider boat ruined could live recommend could would refund money spent bf alas years latenote wollayhalloich finde es erschreckend das du die ddos attacke als ausrede benutzt ich selber leide borderlinedepression und einer sozialen phobie dennoch ich es mich im internet zurecht zufinden es gibt immer trolls die dir den tod den hals ddos attacken sind nichts neues konzerne wie nexon ea etcdas gibt dir keinen grund dir das geld einzusacken und dann jahre zu verschwinden und ohne feedback von den leuten die dein produkt gekauft haben weiter zu machen viele sind dran das es dein projekt istdas mag ja sein dennoch sobald du dein projekt geld verdienst ist es nichtmehr nur deinswir haben das alpha projekt gekauft und wollten dich und du machst alles kaputt wenn du dein geliebtes projekt noch retten willst solltest du auf uns und dich erwachsen benehmen und dich nicht unter nem stein verkriechentldr game deservers hate getting since devoloper lives bubble ive looking forward game coming since seeing gameplay footage alpha completely different game irritating loose items every time switch biomes making biomes unplayable game huge letdown dont get game unless developer rolls back alpha ive game since beginning past years wild ride cube world finally herefor expecting improved version old alpha stop cube world longer game treat game something newyou die lot game punishes hard playing carefully using skill early game region slow involve lot running around able kill weak creatures might lose hopedont stop playingseriously keep playing explore region find ruins artifacts lore items unlock spawn points moving long distances become easy due teleporting find quest boss dungeon spawn point near keep going picking mobs one one youll die lot quickly run back spawn point nearbyas soon get first pieces gear even seem crappy first game becomes easier thats starts get really funcube world game doesnt hold hand punishes hard overcome challenge rewards satisfying worth hour grinding dungeon ive gotta say im disappointed ive looking forward playing game long time alpha still better longer skill tree level system isnt based exp makes feel kind pointless play game isnt feeling progressionwhy mobs hitpoints spawning right next starting area actually impossible kill even baiting enemy town sacrificing npcs wasting minutes trying kite rewards killing said enemy non existant gold killing skull bull basic geara costs get shitty boomerang damage doesnt really make sensethe menus also really glitchy lot times item descriptions go offscreen possible read crafting requirements another problem remapping controls possible accidently use potion shouldnt able use abilities quick items menuthe game much optomized alphaq requires freakin super computer render feels like step backwards biggest gripe wide variety skillslooking foward future progress game cannot enjoy playing ive missed ive never played alpha barely knew anything nevertheless got caught hype finally got hands game felt empty classes horribly unbalanced abilities either nonfunctional boring rogue archer stealth ability rogue stealth abilities really nothing doi ended refunding strongly suggest skipping cube world devs fix even lack progression people complaining game doesnt work ive never refunded game fast remembered game beautiful progression best thing game doesnt new game isnt progression waste time please release alpha version steam buy cant remember old account old version way im gonna get play illegal download ive owned cube world since alpha release six years ago mostly impressive many backward steps could taken development end disappointment game timetheres contenttheres meaningful progressiontheres class depththeres permanent equipmentand theres way spend sales tax game ive played beta bit say ok game promised lot content given barely anything biggest complaint isnt gear system artifacts lack endgame content artifacts boring weak incentivize players hunt also endgame content pretty much expected game loreit much potential become something great got current price id recommend years waited absolutely ive played game since alpha got lot enjoyment steaming pile mess supposed im entirely sure alpha release steam something went terribly wrong experience based leveling system gone looks like replaced sad gear score system get better gear farming materials farming materials running away everything moves unless run faster stay alive farm materials go first sword lets go kill cute little beetle pops like blood balloon garbage run away save money ive put little time game far im impressed really really dislike high level enemies near starting point theres nothing wanting come back ive sunk countless hours alpha beta release different promised worse execution tries honestly skip come back updates first hour two miserable gaming experience reason knew reddit previous experience playing alpha tips explanations anything even skills nothing suggest youre even supposed every creature punishingly hard even white trash mobs like chickens kill hits manage overcome slump finally grab gear anywhere min hours mostly random find itll appropriate gear class people get lucky find gear sitting log others farm hours nothing slowly kill enemies would experience rewards quests get items help explore climbing gearboathang glideretc neat since major point game explore worldnow things fall apart point game explore yet game actively punishes attempt cripplingly hard monsters everywhere slow movement speedno toggle auto running vast open empty lands largest complaint cross border another region lose exploration items collected gear nerfed point uselessness essentially start beginning every time cross new region gear based progression done right actually fun far done well see artifacts collect region carry new regions sound cool right except artifacts give useless buffs hardly noticeable far affect exploration things glad spent hours raise swimming speed slight percentage game much potential artifacts actually made relevant overarching storybossgoaletc literally point leaving first region unless want see new color tilesets end quests collect gear kill things every region measly upgrades make radius lamp like pixels larger genuinely applaud people ive read stopped playing four regions cant even make past two regions meaningless infinite loop progression fact tweets developer years recently month ago showing cool features none things game though one really stings alpha playersthose followed past years development shame since tons fun first region dawned shallow loop game offer hope changes made eventually waited years lets say wasnt worth wait im patient anymore doesnt help devs terrible communication deleting social medias profiles unless wollaypixxie actually say something soon safe assume game abandoned asked years ago get cube world id say yeah fun hard something could endlessly explore grind fun rewarded exploring slap face soon cross different border gear items pets worthless garbage youre forced start zero hard enough shot nearly shot gatei saw added lore game get sentences interact lore piece uninteresting unhelpfuli say im severely underwhelmed couldve kept alpha new mobs improved multiplayer wouldve happy straight cheeks sucks even worse developers decide work well see another update maybe years minimum wont return game know iti nothing constructive say skills required design games however tell certain bad game buy important edit devs already going stealth mode deleting blogs radio silence likely abandon game mess never get fixedwhats point exploration focused rpg gear items region locked meaning go another area gear scales drastically items like hang glider useable new area guy fucking years make something wollay decided make even worseyou know enter new area game uninstall itselffuck sheit fine renders like shit dont make progress go next area items became wayless good special items reset leave area find also game never ever gonna updated idk happened game used fun beta fight boss first quest cant even fight unless hes quicksand trap else get destroyed range damage expected progress barely fight level enemies class wizard would replace gear system old good exp system would good game right fuck first hour without getting killed crow tried kill bought game official release im terribly sorryif bought game however urge try find copy alpha version get hands play instead enjoyed alpha youre gonna bad time thing similar version alpha art style get region lock disabling mod like game fantasticif well game zero progression sucks grew playing nes games prefer lack handholding game

special attack tap ultimate r class special crtl unlocked startthere experience exploring map fully revealed longer procedurely generatedenemys gone level white able fuck shit even enemys youre running simulators shallow combat system tacky visuals game youthis game offers tangible sense progress artifacts find things permanently boost near irrelevant stats thing really offer sense progression game even benefits get artifacts essentially pointless namely theyre nothing worth time something ambitious cube world ended shallow cobbled mess minecraft legend zelda nothing inclines continue playingtheres definitive goal gameplay engaging enough even convince go explore randomly generated world theres denying lot potential current state game sorry uninspiring state youre seeing review dont listen negative ones players alpha wanted game stay exact hate smallest amount change agreed give game bad review release absolutely reason game changed game amazing incredibly fun although difficult start get flow going youre gonna charge ahead rule infinite world im afraid cant recommend isnt promised last years isnt necessarily bad thing even fun permanent progression may aswell nonexistent perland progression neither rewarding fun know everything taken leave region im flashbacks games current state wollay dipped like years agoi dont want yell cash grab thats feels right sadlyalso wont accept negative reviews criticism block straight awayand wrap closed dev blog hed usually keep us updated gameim sad wollay pls throw sign im incredibly dissapointed cube world im going compare alpha since didnt play much hype behind stoked get game friend entered saw incomplete mess ui frustrating navigate regionlocked equipment want start loop grinding dying mediocre equipment makes slow clunky combat bearable leave region lose stuff grinded reward im sorry imagine getting oneshotted squirrel yeah every enemy extremely op way damage run spam ultimate ability game becomes far tedious way boring hope game wasnt made like purpose sort joke imo release version worse alpha release version also missing features advertised devs twitter impossibly difficult start shallow characters world many items description huge need tutorial plus loss leveling system removed one rpg system made combat fun combat worse elder scrolls somehow game got worse years development thankfully didnt buy improved artifacts balance regionlocked gearfex one combat one mobility statother game actually really wellmade world genshin impact exists cannot comprehend playing genshin impact free cube world much much betterbut sure genshin impact read reviews cube world game bad use review find play instead worse state game years ago completely abandoned developer every new region grind everything scatch real progression artifacts work everywhere help possible way except faster region grind thats litterally difference alpha full versionthe developers needed years make game worse current state enjoy game excited see things show trailers thoroughly disappointed found none basically wasted could gone towards supporting something much better sadly dont think ill able get refund ive wasted much time already im upset disappointed feel lied stolen current form game even close promised wait see dev makes regular updatesupdate still updates frankly looks like developer ran away fuck dumpsterfire current state alpha version much better full release removed skill trees locked progression region making gear collected said region pointless also difficult mobs requiring tedious amount time kill even party stick alpha verison hopefully improved opinion game fun flaws fixed might wondering gave negative review well lets say developer disappeared want listen community might wait another six years another update see memes get worse time goes opinion cubeworld good video game although heard leveling system also worked killing monsters seems llogical considdering kill mobs time played friend couple hours even strong equipment still struggled strong mobs didnt level hours playing note went completely blind idea artifacts increased levels ive talked wanna point cant launch anymore crashes going fullscreen still crashes even changing fullscreen fullscreen thats assumption cpu goes full capacity reason crashes game soon done loading dont understand could start first place oh well cant launch anymore guess thats thati also read minimal system requirements ive tried fixing realised cpu shouldnt power run would reason able launch played first four hoursits pity really enjoyed playing anyone tipps information please message c six years core loop made worse instead better nonsensical balance issues remain incredible gameplay exactly expecting epic game butfix god damn multiplayer sucks cant say would recommend game incredible potential introduction whatsoever questionable game balance get easily bored walking around aimlesslylooking forward future changes though incredibly boring gear regionlocked means lose hard earned recipes gear upon entering new area dont know wolly dev thought good idea god damn one hell shitshow worlds empty every enemy much stronger real way farm resources craft better gear game disappointment like buy game potential extremely poorly executed incredibly disappointing hype adding single good feature since alpha really tried like plain simply god awful pure rng progression awful formula nearly every enemy god comparison fun balanced slightest fact get legitimately barred progress bad rng ruins redeeming factor new system could highly recommend staying away dumpster fire instantly abandoned release interesting exploration sense wonder ruined bland combat absolutely baffling design decisions region lock removal exp skill trees complete lack progression creates game doesnt really know wants rpg kinda roguelike really adventure game nowait sale play friends though multiplayer laggy think thoughts brief history cube interesting idea progression line works sadly needs bit thinking thru interesting rogue like hard enemies avoided lower levels game good yes actually appears crash even starts great bothers say fails live game hoping released many years simply doesnt exist anymoresince ive received game picroma store bought alpha review wont counted overall rating trust dont play game cube world absolutely insulting alpha also fails live ownnow wollay developer gone people claim ran away money others say got alienated community either way silent brings back memories alpha best mods region lock bad monsters badly balanced im nostalgia could decent mod modswhich found subreddit overall lacking substance promised worse original alpha build couldve masterpiece im still giving positive review game kept entertained hundreds hours perhaps mods add lot changes thatd nice unlikely get update someday get back former glory bad practically progress really hurts game deeply saddens state game disappointment address differences two versions game since people probably havent played previous version however address issues game experience youll receive game start near village knowledge youll run around spam npcs give quests spend time running away enemies get said quest get quest youll likely find gimmic cheese enemies progression feels unnatural essence youll go able fight anything able fight everything ease youre done area youll move onto another area gear useless since region bound legendaries white new region gear like hang glider boat also region bound cross border progression gone form progression dungeons recollect necessary gear enter dungeon complete get items arent bound region theyre flawed base give slight improvements make progression reset less grueling roughly less percent items increase lantern range climb speed comes class class progression none whatsoever skill tree abilities change except two things modify someone change spec example mage choose fire water thing modify abilities weapon using modifies left right mouse little variety specs well mostly reskinned would highly recommend purchasing game changes made progression system character complexity differed original vision got better areas went different path othersthere mod eliminate zone locked gear issues people fun coop edit playing little bit getting first artifact main zone goal say exploration game punishes exploringafter hours thing able take one zone next clime speed boost mention infinite generated world see reason leave starting zone explore anything going removed soon leave area edit apparently artifacts broken dont actually add anything visually technically meaning even getting pointlessnot theres word devs since hit steam feels awful recommending game years waiting play game first time playing feltemptylike theres something missing reading reviews features alpha version missing made feel like left amazing experience unfortunetly played hours cant refund try ill probably play see opinions still stands gameplay felt also difficult confusing enemies could roll smoke lower leveled enemies absolutely crush might havent played game havent playing enough learnim hopeful wollay update game better fix things hoped playing feels worse alpha fucking sucks much potential sadly dev ignored community great potential realise day updates like dev gone years really wanted support deep shit since game worst anf price way high makings good game right barebones lot features taken alpha merge fact theres features make quite bit frustration tutorial newer players region locked items plus real reason progress outside first region struggle find enemies beginning level make worthwhile purchase right changed alot since years ago bad way though hurts hurts

always spawn wrong place roof something run around field like jackass hour half looking dumbass harp thats gonna give fucking treasure full blue already yellow bummer game resulted six years waiting damn disappointment honestly worse previous build decent long game youve never played beforeits disaster youve playing original version beforeid rather create new character different class go next zone slight increase boat speed never use anyway game much potential yet executed badlythe developers scrapped entire roadmap alpha call reboot ground changing game plays dramaticallythey created expectations using roadmap yet incapable executing let falling short hence criticismsdont buy game think get better updates took years get released yet barely get anything worthwhile let alone complete gameafter years development game surely deserve release version sad fact alpha years ago complete state current version skill trees gone levels gone combat iswell good fact gear stops working cross new zone baffling stops working mean weapons armour back cant use special items last zone hang glider boat seems hes spent long working alone really needed feedback seems lot hype merely coming long time result lot reviews dont actually seem anything useful game needs work enjoy yes dont mind lack tutorial lack levels skills fact gear reset cross line one zone another shame really really exited see six years waiting would bring game dev announced cube world would coming steam ready found removed almost everything made game good reason explore gone see exp would want kill mobs talent tree gear locked zone got gear even glider boat region locked thats insanityi mean order check wasnt going crazy game boring went played alpha version still great really dont understand dev would strip things game instead adding new artifacts quests would remove experience order keep sense growth pure madnesssadly inferior version game loved six years ago super sad edit yeah least friends terrible weird feeling waiting years game refund itbroken dreams broken spirits almost year since wollay abandoned us feels bad man wide ocean depth puddle first jumped shocked huge map everything going get explore however quickly realized little game actually offers seven years since last played game got steam key buying long ago would
