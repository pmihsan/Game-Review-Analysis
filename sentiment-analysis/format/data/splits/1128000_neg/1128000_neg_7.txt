items like hang gliders boats stuff like shouldnt region locked andor level use itemi dont think game bad definitely needs tuningthere lot amazing ideas subreddit steam discussions improving gameand dont think deserves negative reviewbut game sad feeling itedit writing review release date still hope almost year passed release heard nothing wollay developer changing rating negative many negative reviews yet people play right hmm game cant bad right many things removed apparent reason firstly wrong old respawn system dont find new one fun level deepens frustration teleported across region killed bc dont find looking shrines fun mention exploration killed uncovering whole map region locking every useful gear difficulty also murdered mass genocide bc game difficult region blue gnome quest get decent weapon bc old region doesnt work snorefest let us continue weapons happened spirit cubes bc weapon customisation joke buffs small enough make weapon op nice would slow enemy ice etc another thing got slammed would gliders pet riding unavailable time region even finally get another time worthless would better didnt even bother walked everywhere last time regionthere smaller things dubs anime example keyboard controls layouts feel like put together last minute thought put change liking changed back default start game later gem gnomes thought rare numerous alfa features remained ingame play game like happy really dont hours feels like something force play rather something play enjoyment dont hate dont like itenglish first language find mistake dont afraid let know much bad stuff geezi also bought alpha isnt really bad r e stuff cube world website playing plus gear lets use said item regions gathering artifacts stay level across regions ex faster swim speed find one artifactit isnt bad get use could say game extra steps much potential thats wasted terrible core design progressionthere multiple indications simply cash grab lot people naivedesperate backlash community game lacks much direction supporting game thats boring repetitive emptythis passion project hold years months development game remade name thats even less features theres also reports hackers able obtain information game careful play game online much wasted potential think game could fall far sad literally changedbroke everything good alpha made bad unfun yeah thats fine like waited years gamei hate say im truly disappointed stage cube worlds development id much rather play alpha truly fun want reasons im saying guy explained everything totally agree url gamean actionrpg lite game features classes glass weapon choices weapon chooses bulk attacks also specialization sets passive ability based class example mage class go high damage spec one heals well damagethe game world broken several regions land starting inside random region travel region face enemies broken catergoes difficulty talk npcs quests kill enemies area kill boss similar equipment also drop usually category enemyquest one category higher travel area collect neat items like hang glider sail boat climbing spikes reins use ride pet explore eventually uncover location artifacts current region main goal per region artifacts collected make ride pet slightly faster sail slightly faster glide slightly better dive slightly longer general helping exploreso obviously dont recomend game wrong im sure sounds ok farfirst difficulty scaling rather crazy enemies either tough must exploit game mechanics beat enemy cakewalk easy gear main way becoming stronger good weapon dropping utterly wreck toughest enemiesnotice ive said nothing leveling really level system gain level collecting earlier mentioned artifacts level nothing show many artifacts youve collectedonce leave region reward artifact gear becomes usless low level stuff unless found rare gear called gear keep full effect one region away wherever found itall utility stuff found gliders reins etc also disapear cant even use artifact found manage find new region need put bad difficulty progression loop get quickly boring could play slightly better groupbut game big issue rewarding time artifact true permanent reward effect tiny need find item every region effects actually use despite fact personally want like game cant suggest anyone buy unless gets massive changes going harsh blunt keep mind stop reading review dont want hear negativity think game takes years updated polished part features feel thought mean years come handful new ideas pretty straight forward right wrong wrong wrong start pros alpha game buggy flawed direction therefore feel time version game could also become something polished additionally think exploration game unique different like anything experience outside cubeworld ultimately bought game years ago old system exploration however better things always fixed reverted time indeed tell much add liked removedheres bad lot going explain everything much talk first number one end complaint game directions tutorial guide none played hours still understand purple icon top left corner well nothing mean nothing explained number one complaint alpha version well however alpha definitely straight forward gotten worse next thing also quite concerning perfectly fine alpha quality exploration previously reason fight mobs reason fight enemies lower leveled reason fight mini bosses thats right exploration game enemies worth killing ones higher level dungeons past enemies contributed experience points helped level turn would boost stats skills etc however conventional leveling stat points reason kill enemies additionally mini bosses used drop special cubes used advanced crafting one coolest concepts rpg game might add allowed literally customize weapons block block could boost stats give special status effects like slow incendiary etc blocks dont exist ok cool take one unique features game final critique really empty game feels hear people arguing new system makes want play thats false new system make want quit first region nature game makes beginning real grind alpha hard frustrating rewarding process occurs every time enter new region basically like starting scratch every hours awful hate every bit well thats say hopeful first time years special game would finally come updated wrong isnt cubeworld would happier dreams crushed update ever even happened biggest problem
