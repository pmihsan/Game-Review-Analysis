sort like region new game rather starting scratch enemies adjacent region feel like enemies old gear would weak new areas would required good gear even chance advancing next region count good said gear making easier harder start new regions got new region gear gonna hard start doable perfectly rolled legendary gear maybe could skip straight enemies would behave enemies original regioninstead artifacts increasing riding gliding sailing etc reins boat glider etc obtained adjacent areas better old ones old ones dont magically disappear upon entering new area yet getting feels worthwhile would feel really good find say reins different regions ride around ludicrous speedsfor matter make artifacts give mechanical upgrades rather insignificant qol upgrades like currently longer rolling distance longer invulnerability frames higher jumping max stamina increase basically things cant get trough gear land items like reins boat glider actually feel like artifacts getting alot doesnt make attacks make bigger numbers make character feel better play longer combos jumping larger chasms rolling trough multiple attackseven enemy player damage enemies dont feel like sponges dont feel like
