die hundred times find artifacts keep op stuff ways boring middle ground balanceafter years feel scammed cheated wollay acceptable excuse behaviour excuse absurd vanish years come clearly doesnt know developer engaged community active vital anything else shows unprofesional game typical rpg youre kind person patiently waited game come time youll probably like game play loop equipment region locked enemies typically far stronger especially start expect die lot expect die knowing killed way progress get kills find new loot rinse repeat across entire world understanding enemy really half battle herethere greater story make adventure also mean hours absolutely nothing note friends dont mind grindy nature game bring along encounters balanced smart play horde players even youre likely outclassed worth price caveatsthe multiplayer options limited bit obtuse lag quite noticeable unstable connectionsthere classesspecializations much better othersbugsno tutorial terrible instructions play mechanics work use wikiworld generation pretty bad places mounts help alleviate problem biomes better otherif deal breaker likely isnt game want pick everything ive mentioned far common game fun also repetitive game fun ties progression exploration world story generated procedurally means often nonsensical uninteresting gear loses power utility equipment like gliders stop working move new area bizarre attempt reset progression repeat cycle fully exploring zone get artifact gives boring permanent buffs character like climbing swim speedcombat poorly balanced fluid weird hitboxes often youll cycle oneshot forcing cheese mobs getting god drop oneshot enemies backthe visuals dated shadows making things like hills mountains look particularly uglyalso tutorials indication youre supposed game bad point dog shit alpha much completely better beta waste money time investment gets major update maybe way shape form get play shell game game like others even though say bad bad features think unique like example biome locking whenever enter new biome must find different gear relating biome game worth money worst rpg ever seen game really goodi like region lock system work picroma buffs artifacts giving damage dpsplease add game simply enjoyable entire concept means really story combat engaging enough keep coming back odd decisions made developers also make progression feel awkward first minute doesnt ever really get better way regions work world entire experience game spawning hunting around low level mobs actually beatable shit tier starting equipment praying something decent drop finding things actually fight early much chore ever aggressive mobs absolutely decimate chase end earth ui also terrible ugly uninformative explanation anything whatsoever works entirely games detriment dont need hold hand game kinda throws world barest speck anything resembling helpful tipthis game promise alpha doesnt seem like actual issues addressed since instead things changed worse feel like game worth modding get slightest amount enjoyment guest im going move greener pastures checking one list unlucky game hyped ridiculous dont know start know map gave cancer gear based leveling system would great would gear mean anything class personally hate anything gear based game terribly lame shame remember super hyped back day planned buying alpha got taken store id love play alpha though cause everyone likes say better given ive given hours total across characters never even left starting region cant give full critique heres experience gamepart warriorfor first go game wanted badass swordsman knight warrior pick right bat character creator seemed basic didnt much honestly id go say destinys character creator better whatever within minutes got beat onion dawned enemy

kill demons level area point briefly talk levels levels game easiest hardest note leveling also finnicky ive actually never reached level heres ive read leveling requires finding artifact boost stats guess getting better gear game handed mid gamequest minutes ranger playthrough good little naive boy tried pursue never reached place keep mind got merked crabs way therepart mageso today booted game figured classes mage cheesiest bunch surely one class noobs start made sense mage playthrough actually lasted longest managed accomplish following collect hangglider collect boat activate shrines life get merked necromancers onions sheepi guess mage cheesiest classes thats saying much ability knock enemies back shoot powerful missiles enemies summon fire tornadoes mach enemies aimbotting necromancers still died lot also point looked guide level figured relics still havent seen single relic lots high level enemies areas starting region give spanking far gear goes got sword chestpiece amulet amulet thing useful sword actually warriors chestpiece rangers basically loot get near useless collecting hangglider going back town motivation keep playing vanished entirelyconclusionhow happen heard alpha great guess game strayed far alpha barely even recognizable developer listen feedback alpha surely must heard nonstop alpha players worked didnt care alpha players say apparently theres lot bad game havent even stumbled across region locked gear ever fixed dont know dude game dont know disappointing game something completely diffrent originally paid would game concept alpha sure wouldnt bought sad fact think could make completely diffrent game bought iti hate decision go road hope game actually paid come back day game straight boring one biggest letdowns ive ever experienced yes buy alpha back stopped playing couple hours thought game never crossed mind year even didnt expectations itd finished game yet somehow version lacks even content alpha npcs worthless barely enemies whichever enemies find arent scaled chances youre going enemies pretty much one shot absolutely sense things making game extremely confusing pretty much nothing except run around map isnt even fogged see entirety start leveling progression gear region locked step foot new one gear gone game still stupid amount potential disappointing six year gap nothing show game overhyped disappointing game ever played full thoughts summed game totally diferent alphathe developer doesnt listen community literally destroyed game game unplayable shame game terrible ive played mins way much anyoneits used game looks incredibly neat always looked neat since first sold years ago quickly abandoning much potential pretty cool game back still today thats ever potential massive empty every time die get teleported back one set respawn point tends cause walk minutes get back theres real sense character development either plop giant empty world hope slowly fun swear game use sort progression system theres even text remaining telling youre level tldr boring years ago somehow even boring today looks neat though game needs get better soon itll get taken person made game needs people money get game going think needs sell title another company also fighting hard rarity level items cant beat rarity level boss thats mage old hut one attack brings fire balls kills almost instantly even armor health potion active time unlock petrified villagewait till game better go ahead buy dont wait long game get taken wont second chance probably game reminds first girlfriendit fucked took money never saw game released horrible state needs multiple updates even early access game sucks alpha since release looking foward game finally updated finally ruined mechanics systems made great first place waste money youll get bored first min assure worthwhile game sucks pp good way multiplayer lags much enemies incredibly tough environments dry boring overall couldve bought cheap hooker money spent game truly potential one biggest flaws game star difficulty rating system regionlocked gear wouldnt detrimental star system would done away damage could dealt freely enemies
