especially getting regions movement items map entirely revealed start hurts exploration even artifacts much weak incentivize long term progression fear even buffed long remain limited outofcombat buffs uninteresting lack content finishing single region hours afaik youve seen game offerif really want play cubeworld id recommend look getting alpha version game rather right full release isnt worth playing even though game went wrong path still lot fun even mods remove region locking equipment game feels meh play animations sluggish combat either infuriating extremely boring good community discord though even worse alpha version ever time try launch game get error saying could initialize direct fix every hours progress wiped fear get increased lamp radius losing items every time made new character mins game ceased render stuff could climb air restarting help leveling broken could try alpha seems stable years get rip everyone rude unreasonable played hours got axe able kill every enemy way game really fun especially someone else alpha point game could run around theres lore theres quests endless amounts things everything bad game already said alpha amazing needed content everything changed fire nation attacked also known developer removing type progression game would abandon everything far away walking long periods makes boring af almost impossible kill enemies

nothing changed opinion game guess ill say totally serious thanks wollay masterpiece game totally fucking us six whole years waiting completely taint games entire legacy seriously though wollay fucked us many times point im genuinely surprised anyone still actually waiting honestly go fuck wollay honestly never excited game like first shown youtubers literally couldnt wait released somehow somewhere line turned item locking system lost crazy progressive element sad really really sucks never got play original honestly meant wrote played release appalled didnt want look level warrior traversing vast lands fighting could looking forward seeing new things excited see going huge update game obviously went works whatnot mildly infuriated first annual updates wolframs twitter stating release dates whatever plan promising got postponed nothing summer game loved making return excited ran back school hop explore greeted pile shitdont get wrong cube world always hold place heart taking years revamp already perfect game something nobody expected wanted dont want sound like bitch ultimately theres still ways playing cube worlds alpha biggest disappointment everyone knows expecting huge update first voxel rpg probably best played excited rumors new classes new class feats new biomes new mobs levelled mobs colour coordinated levels away went spawn harder zones would get saving restoring villages buried ground shat wolframs obviously made much money hasnt bothered updates fucking frustrating see someone constantly checked anticipation years take fistful shit lob face im disappointed shouldve said sooner honestly disappointing honestly play minecraft terraria year hiatus whatever release garbage world feels empty gear region lockeddevs brought whole circus ordered single clown honestly worse initial mans sky roam around bland environment full tier based enemies building way tiers one area need restart gear scratch transition another area exact thing six years release worse alpha stage honestly disappointing waited long time play game enjoy little bit severely lacking content regions hit miss feels insane start game annoying mind numbing process trying fight white level enemies getting nothing resorting trying drag enemies friendly npcs job incapable anything playing friends far tell far thought well seems join need game need created character means spawn different place lovely pregenerated map need find village travel friend using flight master instead know join friends region invalidates least one persons gear making beginning slog even worseafter initial start dying trying roll good rng finally ability level missions results good luck finding even talking every npc hours region friend discovered landmarks one quest location set map hoping find locations people tell able take pretty much every enemy see feels like horrible miss game different everyone playing another friend got hang decently early lucky npcs give us locations quests getting decent gear startthe rest game different kind slog mindlessly walking around killing enemies hoping good loot even bigger problem system horrible balance killing miniboss wild drop rareer gear seems horrible coop system ends getting op weapon getting one isolates player feeling like cannot anything one good gear understandably tries kill higher tier monsters loot drop would better items inability damage enemies outside level assume meant anticheese mechanic splits party one person good killing things one even worse people perhapsif play someone else prepared lot talking traversing vast empty land masses trying find stuff current level mis matched across region boring watching paint dry traveling around game way entertaining none npcs interesting talking literally youve seen inability travel regions discover different enemies try make game less mundane impossible losing boat reins entering literally region stupidest thing someone could would want ocean biome knowing get swim around hoping find boat would want enter another vast landscape knowing youll stuck one speed wandering around hoping find reins feels like glorified walking simulator half time wandering around hoping find enemies match god forbid die dungeon yet find respawn point close actual entrance requiring walk back different experiences dungeons usually around minutes party deep dungeon longer eagle flight badly want recommend game hot trash modding community hope save honestly bought game way back first released alpha played everloving shit probably putting somewhere around hours guess whole summer friends obsessed good damn game skills fun classes felt great combat blast eventually played less less stopped altogether months since game wasnt getting updated always talked great game going eventually get updated flash forward yearsand gotta say im disappointed whatever reason wollay decided take things made game fun addictive xp removed making killing mobs world pointless combat gutted skill trees gutted progression tied retarded artifacts find give random useless stat even gonna go detail region locking gear hands one worst systems ive ever seenas much hurts im gonna give one recommended maybe wollay revert changes decide update different direction case ill gladly come back flip vote honestly usually dont leave negative reviews leave reviews im probably one alpha users didnt play alpha much cannot comment one game better im going talking gamelets get negatives way idea first time opened game quit half hour killing mobs making progress directionless games fine typically games give freedom choose typically show mention options player set goal himherself killing mobs early feels unrewarding feel like selfexplanatory played game time shows iv played hours hours dont think iv gotten many memorable didnt work class confusing game design choices look map game youll see white area outlines given part game world zones understand intended story sorts given questlines said numerous questionable choices developer made gliders weapons full power essentially region locked dont get weapon havent gotten far im making guesses without looking things much weapons armor ect weakened items wear influence many things importantly imo hp loose hp quickly game even weak mobs required certain level dodging avoid big attacks dont melt love combat feel like pretty fluid think world looks pretty even though blocks think colorful world pretty energetic npc quest lines pretty funthats really right feel like could never recommend game lost even youtube videos watched said dont give wollay believe turn around take easy step step dont let negative reviews bring horrible game developer ruined game communication towards backersonce beat region seen game offer gear lost leave region horrible developer horrible game hot garbage feel cheated even though didnt pay cent towards dev hot load disappointment waited game years crushed many steps back game went prior release every way could restrict fun updates communication nothing last effort cash grab take money run game took steps back alpha years agono longer leveling systemyour gear useless new
