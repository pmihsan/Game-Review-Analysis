nowhere near perfect random gamebreaking bugs optimization terrible alot issues arent worked onstarting arma hard game get people bought game watching youtube vids may idea gamemode style want play others basically left fend game basically sandbox game gamemode style play unique player enjoy game really made everyone many aspects game hours put learn find theres always something exciting learn whether testing new gamemode hopping new server fun arma never ends although game little bit pricy despite long honestly believe worth every penny thinking buying game recommend checking pc specs make sure decently run game thats good go recommend buying game really diverse different alright story amazing community content great mods ive heard amazing online community hours spent single player thanks amazing mission editor game replayable theres always something new try learn squad command systems bit quirky learnable alsotarget rifleman alright needed happen long time agoi hours arma journey theres lot gotta say bohemia released masterpiece game milsim much face point confusing everything easy understand modding game give lot depth expand upon already simple concepts find easy maybe dont like shooting rifle hate combat well theres zeus editor allow sandbox game fun making scenarios ai fight maybe dont like firing rifle find zeus editor boring problem vehicle driver operator extract insertion pilot use wits assemble mortars operate artillery support unit community also okay wont say good awful however find community pretty funny although hard one another fun sarcasm armpit community exists like problems enjoy making people mad community doesnt overall neat amazing title play guarantee mods frequent community attention devs give game never bored always find something want try alright well tell ive played game little bit ive lot great experiences arma bad ones game gone lot changes came long way alpha ive kept arma since beginning checked new updates released bohemia care game even cost dlc doesnt show try fix bugs add awesome new things game regular basis modding community really makes game though theres loads different mods sifi realism likely find kind mod amazingly fun play review arma still bit game means takes good computer get solid frame rate higher settings bohemia announced making bit version arma released soon hope finally take performance issues question game perfect means good amount bugs game breaking times annoying deal imo worth deal bugs fun game alright arma gotta say love game yes game ever going like real life cant feel feels like real life really good getting pretty darn close real dealmy first arma game arma loved one operation arrowhead came suprise added lot content major enhancements heard arma comming like yes gotta get game however suprise felt like leaving stuff instance prerelease making arma pictures jets like game jets also took warefare arma made sad benny guys made thing capture island cti pretty close easy fixnow arma still lot improvements lot new features slightly new scripting easy learn ton content adds game expecially scripts almost script everything see play multiplayer best ones used servers make game adds ton content game please dont ask join zombie crap knowledge therei give game recommend anyone everyone game sets standard military games hear take note sets standard alright feel like write review game closing game ive played mostin short brilliantthough require longer explanations evolved vocabulary game encorporates essence military simulation manages merge different military styles eg air land sea allows players create chain command game go completely players brings another point vanilla content game soso game delivered fully functioning editor allows create custom missions gamemodes potentially nonexistent friends enjoyedit yep still favorite edited awards fite alright im professional game reviewer probably never lets delve deep makes armed assault great game b pros b gunplay weapons game seem liked worked vigourously sway bullet drop even wind effect trajectory round overall function gets vehicles vehicles futuristic game takes place early thats bad thing vehicles seem indestructible terrain well balanced rest military style vehicles civilian vehicles completely different story hit bush youre fire roll pebble goodbye wheel probably developers didnt expect use civi vehicles time function gets helicopters dlc base helicopters hoot fun use manueverable extremely deadly right hands lets get infamous dlc people seem disliking yes purchasable dlc thing lets honest games style marketting nowadays new apex dlc basically added entirely new game arma helicopter dlc adds new ways transport materials mechanized infantry frontlines marksman dlc added new weaponry accomadate exteremely low amount dmr style weapons karts dlc well mess b based helis b b overall dlc bb cons b cpu intensive b yes game extremely cpu intensive dont relatively decent cpu struggle run even lowest settings something devs mustve looked past seeing strongest gpus back made game somewhere around high end wise run cpu wouldve cheaper player less work bi alright first dlc lot yesis good parti issues parts dlcs id say plan get arma get dlcok main game arma combined arms milsim game means depending mission youll access tanks ifvs aircraft fixedwing jets helicopters limited naval action top foot overall vehicles handle fairly well although plan pilot might want get flight stick pedals something like trackir flying keyboard mouse doable however vehicle action kbm perfectly fine tanks drive like tanks cars like cars terms weaponry everything standard handgun way antimaterial rifle vehicles weapons depend actual vehicle tanks get cannons ifvs get smaller machine guns autocannonsin latest update added dynamic loadouts jets could go fight jet outfitted nothing atgms mix atgms bombs could add airtoair missles helicopters less flexible terms loadout doesnt make worse fixedwing aircraft much damage heli jet personal favorite bit arma unmanned vehicles uvs access types uvs ranging darter small quad copter meant laserdesignating targets

fairly poorly due engine functions alright guess time write review game okay arma iii military sandbox firstthird person shooter except like call duty battlefield decent game franchises btw game unique physics engine game hate say gets fun workshop kinda like garrys mod yeah actually game basically realistic depth version garrys mod anyways content vanilla good nothing compared whats steam workshop vanilla arma iii lackluster times boring mods change fact people made complete overhauls game adding ton content like operation trebuchet halo mod adds brand new content game halo ranging spartans marines odst innies way much go top head rhs modern day mod arma sooo much content dont feel like adding review tell game one best sandbox shooters ive ever played also arma ii pretty good gonna lie hope enjoyed terrible alright awhile since ive wrote review military shooter im going arma iii grace know beta still getting review alright know arma iii hope looking arcade shooter really rate arma iii highly example military simulator executed correctly game absolutely gorgeous land sea underneath waters strategy simulator aspect flawless skip beat even use reherse training memorize battle drills get stressful difficult someone isnt use simulator series extensive military knowledge youre like recommend brush bit reallife scenario training playing thisi definitely recommend game purchase fully released youre definitely missing one greatest video game military sounds funny say experiences time especially youre really looking feel like youre shit minus actual suck real thing punishment game hard failures thinking success however rewarding factor well thought plan action alright game almost thousand hours game think safe review game truly fantastic experience scant games friends fight group russian insurgents take prisoner escape kilometers zone already cleared another team evacuation arrives sense realism huge game squad front mine got hit mine mortar something medic tasked getting entire squad rest squad secured area years almost thousand hours every position leadership rifleman medic team lead small teams leader pmc rising force commander pmc tons stories said game issues physics engine isnt best many stories clips vehicles hitting bush joining arma space program campaigns tell good story tend frustrating youll need navigate minefield mine detector mines damn near invisible ive needed restart times care admit get field pros still outweigh cons game end day game massive sandbox simulator huge modding community want hyper realistic airborne unit em want run around friends blowing enemy want postapocolyptic survivalzombie game game make game arma attempted well handles alright basically boys play squad men play arma wasted hours life one game im pretty sure like alrighty dont much time im going get straight point base game good however really pisses dlc cant stand buy dlc use helicopters drive tractor dlc new content stuff already game example good dlc introduces new map area different missions bad dlc adds tanks cost use even though tanks already game free buy game sum actual mechanics stuff great paying extra drive tractor im disappointed also good game alsoi love italy although arma genuinely good game really sad friendly bots died easily gamei ended friendlies killed enemy outnumbered squad one friendly ai especially early section run ahead character professionally trained soldiers cant even keep pace took cover stay like moron let get outflanked slaughtered enemies also need conserve ammo literally spray ammo like crazies please make friendly ai bit competant arma ai adjusted sides hardcore military sims fun game please give us option adjust ai although recommend game definitely dependant kind gamer arma great military simulator great people want experience looking quick run around shooter stick games call duty battlefield even csgo yourre thinking buying id research ensuring game right although see potential lot fun playing friends playing like entail fun instead gives confusion wtf frustration embarrassment hunted six people solo playerthat said fun friends bad playing solo fml although many hours game plan future game great openworld shooter good enough campaign unfortunatly played multiplayer yet plan anyway back review believe game could lot fun friends even download custom scenarios custom campaigns plus lot multiplayer mods like battleroyal played friends computer died instantly lol side lot controls memorise great military simulatorshooter game although dont get online much would like days gamer played game inception sp mp coupled friendly community support severs need find wholeheartedly recommend game wether vanilla game multiple mods available although played much gathered enough give short unbiased reviewfirst game everyone game involves high realism whether thats pro con depends askedit seems generally agreed performance subpar expect low fpsoverall personal score would fall around course milage vary although havent played game much id like game far one best tactical simulators ever played eden editor makes soo easy make scenarios games love making impossible win scenarios enjoy makes think harder survive realism bullets makes game absolute favorite game ever purchased would buy although havnt played yet looked like good game since got money im buying although like chernarus much altis stratis game highly improved arma physics first thing limited itmovement much natural voiceswould recommend yesbut lacks love used feel chernarus landscapes environment general although hours game safe say far favorite game endless amounts things mods dlcs multiplayer aspect game really fun also mess around offline editor arma overall great game although really like game little realistic mean many buttons many things gets really confusing wouldnt recommend people want casually play fps military simulators tons mods dedicated servers game definitley although ive playing molded group game still looks feels realistic glad picked game although buggy highly modable throw interesting events mention zeus game mode game master managing scenario whilst players operate whatever zeus provided many groups serious others less groups found rfindaunit however recommend playing campaign getting basics attempt join group although clunky times arma always insanely good game devs always best community keep updating game far release bunch likeminded individuals pretend soldiers regular basis game builds camradery like looking reason sign get game let although complex game gets really fun really get different online communities ive met many fun people play got say good fun find community definitely recommended people want realistic shootermilitary

pretty great love waaaay mods arma objectsmaps new maps procedurally generated missions mixed mods make comeback game time time missions much multiplayer fan game still great things like zeus random people thanks arma cant play fps games come pretty different hard recommend anyone want somewhat simulation also want fun good mix bothonly downside heavy pc want see far although hard play game gives realistic yet fun feel would armyman action although cant get past first checkpoint get single kill first hours dont let difficulty baffle lot meets eye arma iii offer ginormous sandbox openworld map gives range choice vehicles weapons body gear intense graphics allow magnificent details give best experience possible like field slowly immerse deeper deeper game past reminiscences fps shooting games series call duty counter strike fade however still noticable glitches bugs defects barely affect gameplay give creators urge make game even fantastic already arma series really opened gates bridge connects man virtual reality highly recommend people buy game buy must buy game steam store although like paly game must say isnt worth time money unfortunately spend want learn play propely game man sides cant even count combat simulator cant jump yes game cant even playing game easiest mode possible makes impossible spot enemies spot enemy ai sees terrain buildings obstacles time dont even know shot came many times unable move direction stuck inside giant want buy game play game either want spend endless money dlcsedit doenst matter good pc youve got play means game doenst optimisation play servers basically unplayablesquad much better game imo although put yes recommendations say game everyone people lot lot free time hand like hrs fast paced game nut rather slow paced game u think u cam make next movepros realistic physics dontlike game type download mods make things less hackerscons mods need download good experience download like gb mods required play people good servers pro wontgive chance play although image quality optimization good enough still highdof game game military fans although early stages game true potential issues need fixed multiplayer combat people stealing vehicles soon spawn however game enjoyable wouldnt reccomend game weak computers even low graphics still requires quite lot work cant really enjoyed everyone looks like potatoe overall good game promising future tactiful community many battles lasting may hours await although unforgiving difficult times still excellent military simulation thouroughly enjoying although frame issues times solid title unique multiplayer experienceworth buy imo although amd intensive game dont enjoy game specially role playing playing scenarious mechanics simple although currently working game mod community anything would ever want although may cost lot resources run game super fun play realistic although may niche openworld army roleplaying game couldnt bring grasppp control schemes well factored overcomplicated mechanics inventory system example make game likeable enough play enough drawbacks make worth money although may seem overwhelming first get controls arma becomes fun mil sim shooter probably favorite mil sim time although fighting get laggy means perfect game rush get every firefight awesome yet find another game captures better arma although may still disguised beta sort stageits still immensly fun hop onto multiplayer server try invade annex im referencing hop formed squad clear aos help coordinated allies zeus also incredibly fun youre dropping people st storms ability basically create batles fun concept indeed workshop intergration allows mission creators publish stuff easier people acess want buy dont mind definetly keep eyes arma incase something makes suddenly get urge buy like many many mods hope see field although requires decent pc really good stupid funny game enjoyed many different ways although everyone id highly recommend considering purchase arma seems like interessing game got tonns depth alot replayabiltiy id also like note game uhugleyu flexible editor may big pull factor anyone enjoys creating scriptednonscripted missions play share using steamworkshop although nice game cant wait arma xd although many fans arma series critical certain aspects gamesuch choice make based future would still highly recommend game fan fps rpg strategy game types base game basically fps modding community expanded basic description meet gamers needsincluding game strongloyal fan base years dont try game point honestly havent lived

gameplay graphics still best arma one best strategic realistic shooter marketits mod support community offer decent amount game modes scenarios cool stuff giving oportunity play shooter also amazing role play game depressing post apocalypse survival game realistic military simulation far many cool things brought community bohemia itselfif like strategic realistic shooter arma must make sure check system requirements buying although ai admittedly intelligent population commits homicides still criminally stupid although engine vastly improved predecessor graphics look amazing game still feels
