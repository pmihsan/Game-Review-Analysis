military gameplay epic fanbase alot games nowadays promise never deliver arma deliver added alot game makes fun like probably bleed death die get shot oncethe workshop great content multiple maps like chernarus factions like united states armythe bad thing game runs fps bad cpu research buyingso pros cons tactical gameplay realism epic fanbase alot gamemodes move body head alot stands hands bad optimized gun sounds almost sound familiar mods thoughso totally recommend patient good computer im original operation flashpoint cold war crisis player still original install disks manuals arma everything expect current generation franchise knew loved origin sequelsi ea backer title ea release today bis developers backers players mod community among amazing something milsim always inspired sincere dedication detail followers developers im awful game still lot fun im bad seems fun lol need learn actually play im bound get metric tonne dislikes ill live please note im giving negative review history arma franchise starting armed assault moving arma expansions playing using ace mod fact certain expectations inevitably preordered gamenow please note issue setting near future fine provided done correctly regard believe arma really shines yet play game set near future believable arma majority weapons vehicles already exist lot outdatedmy issue arma fact shocking lack content base game massive step downwards terms realistic fidelity performance game abysmal even someone computer massively overpowered game argument could made else could turn game seamlessly integrates combined land sea air warfare massive scale would believe argument arma ii expansions didnt exist thats problem done much better standardwhy soldiers flinch shot continue fight back nothing happened arma shot legarm ai movement would impaired aim would impaired arma nothing simulated whatsoever instead enemies take multiple hits downed even extended armour turned offi dont understand bohemia decided create factions less mirror images one another reused assets mounted mgs grenade launchers missile launchers alike puzzling frankly lazy dont understand removed core features draggingcarrying wounded allies healed properly dedicated medic opposed magical heal faks game dont understand theyre still using tired engine used years ago game much greater scale terrain amount buildings graphical fidelitydont get wrong arma iii stroke technical genius managing take virtual reality engine make look good mind blowing whats point looking good game runs like shit even installed ssd still stutter loading playing online ive found cities etc framerates completely unplayable playing reasonable player count consider pros conspros beautiful looking game interesting concepts behind near future setting movement easily better previous games stance system whilst part movement good enough mentioned bipods work really damn cool ai much smarter previous installments reacting better cover suppression sound design much better although guns still sound bit something rectify quite quickly sound mods inventory system really nice intuitive steam workshop support makes mods easier use however due file size limit really supports basic mods couldnt care less campaign bit cohesive time around previous campaigns felt bit aimless pre recorded voice linescons lot game caters casual players explain following ammo pool showing many shots left gun regardless difficulty setting fucking ai tank several rounds fire back perfect accuracy nothing flinch gone days crippling someones arm reduce accuracy taking legs stop vehicle crosshairs almost never line hud counterparts cannot turned weapons poor penetration value ive seen argument made future armoured vests allow survive longer appreciate stop fact kinetic force bullet would still wound point ineffective dont mind soldiers surviving least incapacitate fucks magical faks heal point dedicated medic luxury server issue game everyone running casual epoch altis life etc servers far outnumber traditional game servers think speaks really game targetting people arent authentic military shooter people want use third person sprint everywhere take things seriously faction practically identical assymetrical balance like previous games everyone one assault rifle one type grenade one type mbt one type transport helicopter one type attack helicopter one jet wtf exact grenade launchers missile launchers uavs ugvs submarines recycled content fucking lazy dlcs thus far offered little content price example baf arma added entire new faction play vehicles weapons respectively whilst cant comment expansion pack operation arrowhead practically new game pr bohemia released tanoa seems compelling part apex probably run like shit amount trees etc dont like altis personal preference game runs like absolute shit several rigs ive tried including ram titan xs sli running ssd remove loading stutter possible get game running nicely hardly weaponsvehicles per faction touched briefly months csat nato got jets theyre ground attackers one large transport vehicle shared faction faction exact uavs ugvs submarines grenades chemlights smoke grenades ghillie suits armour etc etc etc fuck take multiple bullets drop guy unless im using intermediate cartidges armour seems sponge bullets absolutely reason drag wounded allies carry themthis game drives insane wanted like desperately iteration series build upon predecessor many regards arma iii improved many ways took many steps back cant recommend game anyonenow ace definitely makes game lot easier stomach base game still unfortunately unfortunately way could say play game youre used arma ii im sure ill get lot arguments people saying mods fix x z fact arma ii didnt need fixing arma iii im calling solid minor issues game bohemia constantly fixing small thingshuge scope ability mods type game mode could want battle royale full scale invasions im currently running best frames got mountainous areas town would drop low thats low settings minimal visibility mention game requires play every day months get decent dont kind time returned hours play im disappointed paid game terms gameplay really great game order fully enjoy imagine purchase several dlcs theyve advertised fact short campaign missions multiplayer seems lack quite bit well joined
