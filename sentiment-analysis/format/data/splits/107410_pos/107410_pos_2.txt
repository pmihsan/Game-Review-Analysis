best explaining game truth game potential enormous simple tutorial help way truly learn play game friend explain middle already ongoing battle playing main campaign vehicle collisions game relatively badly made uncommon see tanks getting launched sky whilst furiously spinning every way imaginable slowly drove onto miniscule rock bad angle one example whilst common definitely one theres whole plethora naming would needlessly inflate one section ai sometimes act weirdly happen quite often get shot bush normal human would chance seeing furthermore ais reaction commands case squad leader ignored ai commanding general also goes back fist point try lot order fully understand positives get immersed gameplay game created immersion mind thus missions people play good get quite excellent experience thanks game also partially sandbox enormous number things frontline soldier helicopter pilot simple logistics truck driver commander entire unit provided enough people willing listen none interests simply mess around friends good laugh equipment many pieces equipment take measly hundred hours master theres vehicles mraps apcs aas tank destroyer several tanks remotely controlled drones theres weapons feature basically modern armies use today sniper rifles machine guns submachine guns assault rifles underbarrel grenade launcher aa rocket launchers could go yet would make section needlessly hugetheres also important point find neither negative positive whilst game features singleplayer id say multiplayer far way entertaining important however game made way player cog machine
