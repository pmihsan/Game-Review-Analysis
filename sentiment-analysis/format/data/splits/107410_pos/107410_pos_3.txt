infantry simulator played really problem arma vanilla game futuristic weapons like everything thats prototype still development know arma mods correct like rhs alive allinarma highly recommend game anyone likes milsims likes arma series general start want say stop thinking buying game cant see right gamemode look invade annex feel people get arma aside lets get startedarma obviously milsim set modern times large array weapons sadly arent named correctly probably due lack licensing single player usually runs many people since well optimized thats requirements based dont surprised paired sli sometimes dips multiplayer servers way course system like wont see severe fps drops doesnt account server lag come quite often arma game takes planning certain operations obviously gamemodes like king hill require less planning action faster gameplay want immersive go servers jsoc provide realistic feels surroundings servers jsoc require indepth planning communication team ensure swift execution plan said indepth mean waiting minutes whole squad sort path transport path foot method locating enemies method taking reducing risk casualties indepth one con arma sounds guns honestly sounds like im shooting air pistol shoot rifles dont sound better either mods improve sound feel game come realistic gun sounds movement body positioning arma fantastic im sure certain number different ways position characters body aid lines sight think fantastic feature detailed youre wondering run specs gigabyte micro atxmeasly little hard drive ssds give slightly better performancetheyre main things contribute towards gameplay worst servers im looking right centre busy ao occupied vehicles soldiers friendly enemy would probably dip minutes improve reasonable cpu gets real kick ass best servers theres many people im small ao friendlies id get decent view distance matters quite lot set way max cpu load objects times puts unimaginable stress cpu unless overclocked kaby lake dont recommend even singleplayer view distance sits around runs pretty decently quite high often sniping piloting youre always playing close quarter infantry suggest turning downi think ive said enough game works runs different types playstyles hope review enlightened maybe ill see field timeedit simple soundmod like jsrs dragonfyre supported multiplayer servers fix issue guns sounding horribly unrealistic friend convinced buy game kinda skeptical towards iti thought kind cod like shooter turns exact opposite mostly friendly player base good graphics age coursethe game mechanics movement pretty clunky thoughit takes get used itbut pretty nice game especially roleplaying buying game please take minute read complex game steep learning curve start game even bootcamp option clock running doesnt sound important looks differently realise two hours game time expired chance getting refund disappears clock running even reading manual taking part vr training area doubts ability come grips game two hours would think another game instead said clear fans dont appear put limit perhaps bought cd instead getting upset dlc price take look get map worth money problem supporting creators one best games market today

want ride tank helicopter kart want civilian simply roleplay wild dreams want play god really much said arma said yes bugs yes still bit laggy gets better get better developers still update game listen fans feedback hundreds mods whatever want simply follow missions main difference military shooters sandbox concept means buying lot games one start want note optimization issues game gtx game tries hard aspects tries hard gritty realistic tries hard push hardware limit tries hard make player feel like bought worth arma contains simple campaign uninteresting story simply solo players want go structured missions lot people slate call duty battlefield bad campaigns god arma campaign poor compared call duty bettlefield game played campaign full dimensional characters really takes time get going like freedom campaign gives brief freedom soon grows boring stale arma contains variety gamemodes multiplayer side feel unstructured boring long soul crushing task finding decent server let

episodeto surprise one third episode even uninspired boring missions third episode dont contain single unique idea unlike second episode fistful thosewhats worse story absolute garbageeverything interesting happens offscreen game doesnt even give answers questions raised giving answers questions didnt exist pointit doesnt even conclusion ends abrupt cliffhangerits definition trashall episodes combined campaign doesnt even use interesting locations altis stratisfor strange reason even introductory first episode many missions take place stratis fairly small make sense story standpoint thats fine dont would totally alright take place altis doesnt make sensealso missions altis take place boring locations even though tons varied locations eg huge town stadium ghost hotel airport vast desert mountain full windmills use type locations small towneven worse third episode takes place entirely around single town neochori decide well never knowthe game fine though thats matters end little
