hardware improvements predecessor ive mediocre fps boosts upgrade yes every one builds could run aaa games era highultra settings im fully convinced setting program mod hack hardware change bring better fps game certain point anyone whos told otherwise either plays single player expect much higher frames simply lyingmany people quick point yes game playable game half decade old thats still updated still new dlc released still price tag show think demanding better bohemia interactive community dismal framerates one reasons ive stopped playingas many reviewers players happily tell arma large diverse communitybut experience want sit play multiplayer given time vast majority active servers youll find going life roleplay survival deathmatch unot cup tea turn back nowu seek gamesif want gamemode like milsim support territory control vehiclefocused tanks planes helicopters oh even simple coop youre going hard time finding full servers variety missions even vanilla content arma offer im saddened see multiplayer community doesnt embrace much oh uif like use mods lifeblood game youre going even less luck finding server play onu many popular servers allow join anything vanilla means unmodified game uthere however silver lining u lies many arma clans units around since distant sunset days original armed assault formed arma brought new different breed player series fanbase matter desire chances theres unit match arma fascinating ability brings together players ages backgrounds ive met multitour military veterans old enough grandkids watched play right alongside kids havent even graduated highschool well every group inbetween admit meeting many players time uthis unifying ability one havent seen fully realized game date u yet even must weary another reviewer pointed

multiplayer events vary greatly depending type group must admit experience comes various milsim units training preparing signing op weeks even months advance isnt sitting weekday evening firing server browser though means youll wait scratch arma itch ughand unrelated note another phenomena ive noticed arma games hardcore fans excuse prepared shortcoming point ithey seek argue hoursi like playing chess pigeon awful even constructive criticism met unwavering resistance within community especially apparent bis forums intend going report issues expect may talked ifilthy player dare assume know whats best gameiutheres certainly something nice said subculture elitism within arma community uof course pertains multiplayer arma none concern youre prone plink away unimpressive ai play number singleplayer scenarios campaigns explore vast yet somewhat lonely terrains game singleplayer session run vanilla content consume theres thousands gigabytes mods missions full campaigns waiting feast

immersive even shoot trees still feels like firefight well trees shoot back get like milsim want something bigger scale insurgent offer ive playing arma since alpha stage really like game youre fan milsims must even youre theres always things instead shooting people take altislife life gametypes general example socialize make friendships make money youre interested sort thingits realistic game comes vehicles theres game time offers infantry vehicle gameplay scale realistic ive playing arma series since beginning something always stood games casual gamers people want hop kill people log arma always getting extra realism realism come cost quick encounters know would say thats entirely true gamemodes even best gamemodes cannot really change arma end dayyoure dealing map absolutely immense snipers making shots kilometer away also guys spraying lmgs point blank time jets flying around mach engaging targets happens seamlessly battlefield makes amazing moments also means game doesnt always present nonstop action lot walkingdriving get need goif anything think armas greatest strength also thing people hate immense allow anything doesnt encourage people remain small ao said isnt single military based game personally prefer also person happy sit around hilltop away landing shots targets moving everyone interested wasting away weekend maybe ten twenty kills though think absolutely

optimizing game doesnt even matter graphic settings playing fps cases improve alot aswell game low graphics settings looks really bad maybe bohemia consider putting work optimization game instead adding dlc wear ghille suit without getting advertisement screen buying dlc excuse english game realistic function play online offlinei recommend vr training go multiplayer cover basics game short

horrendous barely playable notable specs gb ramyet high end pc im lucky get fps town town dont get started gun battles im playing video options low disabledthis game supposed combat simulator almost impossible real enjoyable gun fight basically strongest weapon got lucky enough thousand fps drops battle wins barely skill involved due frustrating trying kill someone good luck killing anyone

fixedbe able fix without taking hours game looks cool honestly cant even play new laptop gf bought want refund game highly think wont game looks good audio fantastic style play considering fps authentic mission designs training great well thought clearly see many people taking game franchise provides much realistic diversion one would get cod etc giving negative review game something control format like effort make game realistic developers provide many customization options keyboard took roughly hours tweak controls point halfway playable even button feels like everything isnt smooth know disagree despite unrealistic approach cod etc franchises one thing feel always get right intuitive make controls feel really best way describe say experience enough training practice weapons manipulation tactics movement etc becomes second nature smooth despite chaos battlefield provides said game gets things right whatever fun joy found opinion anyway taken away overly complicated controls layout game looks greats moves great old core duo long lear curve play master thats badbut interface frustraiting take world time bring iron sight stable even prone position
