game make go crazy though victor troshka approves video review parts text review omitted review size restrictionsarma tactical shooter first person shooter infantry combat simulator whichever term tickles fancy better modern warfare simulator probably accurate group words describe though arma play singular soldier sometimes command soldiers goal follow typical real world military objectives highly realistic least comparison war games market war simulation different kinds variables influencing things work weighing capabilities real life soldier instead super adrenaline pumped super soldier jump plane shoot enemy pilot take plane midair like battlefield something else arcadey focus arma huge modding base mission editing capabilities along regular dlc content coming support ensure always something mods dlc aside arma worth time moneywell lets start gameplay said gameplay highly realistic still fun thats whole arma series known fun play also realistic manage aiming sight result shot curving side spinning around like ballerina like shooters think making nonscoped shots miss realistic pretty much anything imagine war fly jet helicopter copilot drive tank gunner fortify bases build bases lead squads lead platoons run around solo middle warzone nothing pistol helicopter lands russian soldiers beside point im trying say anything happen real war happen arma thats scripted mechanics set pretty solid theres good support everything theres much detail zeroing gun manually calculating firing artillery situation call laying ambushes explosives making intricate plans sides map affect entire operations done right wrong much gun sways probably biggest con find mechanics laid sways way much youd think character constantly seizure even adapt things work way want gamebreaking anything like thatthe big problems comes arma gameplay exact problems every game series games engine clearly meant simulation actual player gameplay controls always every iteration clunky youd expect shooter feels akin slowness lack precise control third person melee brawler styled game nothing real virtuality engine seems allow smooth gameplay game ever made ever anything clunky play said arma probably least clunky arma title however offset bugs level graphical optimization get laterfor lets move onto story even admit one going buy arma game story every arma campaign always hopelessly buggy unfinishable without restarting certain missions game finally works also combatting twitchy ai also cover shortly arma however puts much larger emphasis story arma provides part campaign prologue boot narrative driven official arma campaign ever seen guided objectives defined paths complete gave far lowerranking military feel open sandboxy feel previous campaigns thats say open world aspect necessarily missing certainly part allows almost anything happen even scripted story missions sometimes youre wrong place wrong time realize see enemy vehicle closing feet away mounted grenade launcher aimed right youthe story easily engaging interesting narrative ever seen arma game prologue included play one nato soldiers generally try survive enemy onslaught overcome power story moments easy see coming many still hit hard really result unpredictable yet talented writing found main characters certainly engaging sad died die suddenly choices course like arma affect certain outcomes thankfully nothing tedious collecting evidence war crimes timer campaign also features sort side quest mechanic episode called adapt youll play basically defensive using guerilla tactics enemy forces outnumber outmatch choose try even odds venturing occasionally small squad complete optional objectives acquire static fixed weapons weapons may certainly superior youre using never really touched temporary feature get episode really quick point weapons ammo concernoverall id certainly recommend games story especially take account extra missions dlc user created campaigns

enviornment arma proves one realistic minesweeper games ever come marketalthough arma lacks features hitmarkers gears arma theft auto vii proves well worth many fun laughs memories shared great game long friends play terrible single player expierience due extreme boredom blandness terrific multiplayer many mods available free even somehow cant find something like vanilla game find something love workshop mod tools lean serious communities supported dedicated servers arma satisfy veteran pc gamers used amenities many franchises dropped game stays true roots yet innovates way expands possibilities limits mods perfect ptsd simulator mods probably best inf sim game far mods fantastic game mods great coop without mods lame scifi game lacks alot modern equipment actually really crappy even though bohemia knows majority players probably play ace since first arma game including arma cold war crisis whose original name recently operation flashpoint cold war crisis due bohemia owning name changed arma sold operation flashpoing brand codemasters years ago still havnt made ace mechanics standard part game really dont understand bohemia gotten away putting much actual content base arma excluding free dlc like apex modders fleshed game point really nice thats disregarding mouth breathers play stuff like king hill pvp trashi never liked arma much without mods without mods arma kinda sucks alot archaic issues inherited past games fixed mods yet issues engine cannot fixed dont surprised game uses roughly half cpu half gpu without maxing either still netting fps normal ridiculous game really uses one core important time sensitive processing use two cores fair amount actual important stuff going one core think four cores used likely two cores minor processing like sound stuff isnt going hold gameregardless best simulator large scale tactical game market competition doesnt even come close often best poor representation arma faults perceived real still really fun game play right group people would personally say pvp pretty shitty considering pvp going revolve around metagaming rather players behaving somewhat realistic way two enemy forces would eachother real life dont enjoy killed guy hiding bush guy decides start spamming grenades like codwaw thats enjoy arma interaction players cooperation overcome issues get objectives done wanted shoot dudes throw grenades would go play whatever generic fps popular day hours playing game say gets approval limits game might issues see past best shooter ever made played standard arma might think becoming every
