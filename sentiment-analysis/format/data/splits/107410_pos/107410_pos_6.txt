back still abandon ware since day one engine mess physics doesnt work unoptimized matter hardware solely relies modding badly made dlc doesnt offer much content quality youtube popularity hardcorecringy milsimers took fun game several gameplay visual settings either doesnt work sometimes wont save doesnt even exist controllers embarrassing still havent improved visual effects sound effects physx joke still even chose early days still baffles annoying dlc adverts menu screen want enjoy content multiplayer doesnt work due games terrible performance people say ai complex true still trash nonetheless campaign boring cheap editor scenario default settings use low fov bloom motion blur dof mouse smoothing moron came idea took years barely get anywhere developmentif possible refund
