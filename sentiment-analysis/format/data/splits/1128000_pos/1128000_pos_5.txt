actual game played ton alpha really loved excited come disappointed everything great alpha stripped extremely unenjoyable mechanics like region locking getting rid traditional leveling mechanics completely ruined game unless lot improvements made zero desire continue playing game played ton original alpha enjoyed linear generic rpg progression current system regionlocking feels especially unpleasant sail across region border character dump boat ocean longer know sail boatthese systems need fleshed explained theyre going feel good player definitely work progress world great systems fleshed made fun itll great perhaps wait purchase played loved game alpha game progression changed lot find type gameplay apealing others game still feals like beta needs polish progression might need tweeks played alpha beta lot great times playing game years agothe beta difficult alpha version get kind frustrating times first start playinghowever think progression system really unique adds level difficulty progression many enjoy though ive already gotten pretty used already enjoying game thank wollay great game played hours sense consistent progression whatsoeveri enjoyed cubeworld alpha

viral changes made released game questionable making almost unplayable due lack progression played game fun couple hours add couple mods like cubegression cubetravel cubepatch game gets pretty fun highly suggest play game mods played since alpha personally think game wonderful take things take account dont like grinding min maxing etc play casually fun friend two hours upon game hand information expect figure stuff mmo even really rpg adventure action game go wanting get crunchy numbers wont good timelast thing read negative reviews youll find two kinds reviews genuinely dislike game state want constructive change spewing hate wait years game expected taking sides saying dont take every review full face value played alpha betai honest game perhaps good idea region lock equipment full potential original region got artifacts items permanently boost utility stats needs changed rebalanced lotregion locked equipment retains use end neighboring regionswollay dev lot plans years ago really good plans scratched sorta like started game bad requires lot polishing get good strongly recommend wait couple updates intends upgrade game otherwise dont buy recommend another voxel game like trove perhaps hytale comes xdscore played alpha disappointed gave game fair shot think game fun hours however first clear region starts feel aimless pointless due fact one region loop reward completing loops artifacts increase mobility small margin affect combat opinion enough reward fact become stronger equipment equipment gets reduced nothing new region means youve basically beaten worst game throw one regionunless enjoy sent back amounts level one every region mobility increases gained permanently character work specific item region eg reins boat etc random chance spawn region artifacts wont even anything recommend game september played alpha back enjoyed game thouroughly version game lot stuff replaced gameplay wise lot people like personally way game right allows exploration completion factor great love games region pretty satisfyingunfortunately gear one region usable another region im sure might changed someday wollay updates game frequently small changes bug fixes believe take consideration everyone asking recode features teasing twitter past yearsi believe game eventually become looks like tweets right hes making sure works together perfectly fine add new feature back bug fix feature added edit wollay ditched us longer recommended kept original review seen played alpha well hours ive played beta currently meme moment shit game please dont let stupid people people barely played hour try sway opinion gamethe game fun combat fun exploration fun classes different enough change way play game still fun dont know creator wolly went quiet years years people started harshly negative bash game one man team wife pixie work well isnt company behind game two people best game fun hope wolly stick keep updating game ignore memers want tear game fun ive got worth like exploring looting bit grinding youll enjoy game played alpha quite bit first came loved game time really looked forward thought might become new version definitely wanted playing

weapons armor new region ive collected artifacts far dont know help weapons armor hopefully collecting enough new regions become easier easierim working father husband game easy pick play short time without relearn last time able play played alpha death adult played full game much many us buy games graphics neat game fun dont get core gamebuilding concepts care debate game cute fun easy spend hours exploring terrain still large enough learning curve exciting adults sure improvements make happen coming weeks months release solid use played alpha loved played release still absolutely loved negative reviews fair points release deserve nearly amount negative reviews received game much fun havent enjoyed game much playing long time hope developers continue add features polish house building function character customization ui could use refining positive experience whole definitely worth buy played alpha amazing game waited like ish years update whole time waited knew game abandoned mind update finally comes however pretty disappointingit feel like years went game game actually less fun alpha right nowi hopeful game gets fixed becomes great guess wait played alpha years ago whatever reason game removed profile website bought steam played long realized point playing game whatsoever dont level region locking hinders exploration wouldve happy originally promised didnt play much cant speak much new systems time fight anything im gonna benefit fighting found avoiding enemies running around people might like new system wollay implemented cube world lot potential quite since wollay gone silent doubt therell improvement time soon youre fence game go reviews saying save money buy something else played alpha years ago review im attempting unbiased keep mindits extremely hard look game like objectively sensational development surprise comeback recently trythis game undeniably certain charm one games feel compelled wave npcs beautiful artstyle incredibly atmospheric timesit isnt easy defend games shortcomings really doesnt give much direction could certainly learn love tell depth significant amount content surface level hard reach bottom line dont regret purchase years ago really dont lot reasons shouldnt end day im glad bought think youll glad thats positive review isnt kind developer see issues game take money run im sure many issues experience addressed pointtheres good chance youll like game feel spending justified sincerely believe played alpha personally found boring past hours playtime beta got free figured id try actually pretty fun much longer time alpha understand kinks progression system need worked like making artifacts significant interesting overall see regionlocked itembased progression much enjoyable biomes also need reworked like making oceans visually interesting boats prevent freezing ice biomes still beta however consumers expect problems games beta long stuff like fixed release game problems played alpha ive played different enjoy played alpha finally getting chance try game sadly disappointed core gameplay loop hasnt improved progression feels meaningless would write longer review think fair review game deserves would randomly generated oneedit ingame map fantastic though played alpha confirm current game different experienced back made lot alpha players angry arent major changes whole point alpha stage development think lot people dont like current release simply different genre roguelite rpg doesnt mean terrible game sudden shift style could lot smoother devs communicated better last yearspersonally enjoy alpha im enjoying current release areas definitely need polish adjustments eg region locked glidersboats foundation great game already place props developers actually following releasing game didnt played alpha loved game much fun exploring leveling combat finding awesome gear customizing gear soaring around glider probably hours alpha exploration real purpose world map wide open real reason explore see fly anywhere leveling done artifacts seem grant minor perks movement stats skills unlock gear regionally locked leave region venture another sweet gear gathered uselesscombat good wasthe game lost made fun longer sense progression longer drive explore fight droves monsters gain sweet xp unlock skillsmake ones unlocked even betteri sure happened development really hope dev bring magic back game make alpha cannot recommend game played alpha quite bit playing like going updatesthe alpha fun lacked real end game game became stagnant easy right gearthe beta potential lot replay ability understand needing set back leave zone really hate gear useless mechanic like direction game pushed mechanic think game needs sort progression system feels rewarding want see unique quests toooverall like think lot potential almost completed first zone hope game doesnt feel repetitive one zone complete played alpha several hundred hours loved progression system enemies scaled level approachable could actually explore groups mobs random level destroy loading new world still copy alpha click run version loading compared years later sad year old version fun played alpha shortly releaseand ive enjoyed game since thenthis latest group updates amazing genuinely hope actions trolls unhappy children hasnt scared wollay away continuing make updates publica beautiful game exploration enjoy friends played alpha exhaustioni bought game new releasei liked progression looplook past negativity game still great played alpha version back fun game awhile felt really shallow lacking content also poorly balanced however needed expanded upon would fantastic game unfortunately isnt happened six years later game changed fundamental level better im even sure could call game rpg anymore bjust things noteblistskill trees removed game nothing replace levels experience removed game skills unlock none gear interesting simple stat upgrades passive abilities hit effects anything like every time leave region gear gets taken away reason fight enemies strength level enemies every region game never gets harder first region listyou also collect things like hang gliders boats moment leave area gets taken away reason find game justification either completely baffling collect boat one region try sail neighboring ocean boat bdisappear im riding b game chock full things like feels like developer trying waste timethere zero progression mechanics beyond tiny upgrades movement ability take hours get im talking things like sailing faster swimming faster etc ibim kidding form permanent character progression game bionce youve played hours youve seen everything game offer reason go different regions gameplay fundamentally thing real progression varietyi could keep going every single confusing design decision game wouldnt really add anything game isnt fun consider cautionary tale developing game complete isolation outside feedback years may bad idea played alpha years ago heard id get free beta access well full game free excited finding core features game stripped away disappointed honestly think wouldnt gotten game free wouldnt even play someone paid money mean like something like played alpha would suggest fixing hud adding leveling let us choose seedand make dungeons frequent put map marks walk without even like alpha game potential please something played beta hours feel like hours deserved game sad pathetic husk alpha feel like worked years maybe couple months fact lose equipment going new zone one stupidest game design decisions ever seen hours played game feel like basically accomplished nothing even find artifact would gotten pathetic boost useless noncombat stat anyway go new zone start process basically like made new character way improve characters combat stats reason wollay decided remove experience game played game long back alpha kind feels like played older worse version game hope make game fun somebody figures way mod game back alpha new buildings stuff wollay obviously isnt going fix gamei disappointed wollay played crap original alpha version cube world pirate unavailable purchase missed ability played friends got high leveled almost classes warrior missing excited found game released days happen people feel possessive game good reason original alpha taste game lot potential current version feels similar stream lined good bad played every class almost completely max gear yellows better starting areas quickly realised one form grind broken larger form grind instead grinding levels going broken dungeons randomly generated hunting world bosses loot grinding special stones upgrade gear something different new system main game play loop comes gear progression questing killing monsters talk npcs wandering towns gain locations quests information tell places get vehicles glider boat climbing gloves remove stamina requirement climbing instead leveling stats skills everything relatively increased based gear equip crit gear make particular classweapon combo build work better alternative regen haste stats enjoyed system though miss able get elemental stones upgrade particular stats gain effects particular enjoy rogueninja lots haste regen double dagger poison two handed blade fun right clicks ninjutsu really good engage tool long actively dodge attacks use right click key moments gain crit next right click mana fun active play style combat quite different depending weapon youve selected available choices class two available specialisations take part rogue assassin able stealth every fight properly geared one shot even starred monsters different mobile ninja engage handle fight like knock knuckles right clickso get access full class kit constantly change weapons swap specialisations game gives lots room try different set ups easily wish form long term progression tiny bonus movement stats though quests enjoyable certainly appreciate technical challenge creating much random generation scratch game doesnt enough long term hook huge shame consider much fun could built gear went la diablo gear actually depth robust crafting systemi think game worth dollars even get sale wollay doesnt deserve lot hate gets people feel really passionate game good reason clearly something right one man originally meant pet project people begged release game basically simplified randomly generated voxel bassed skyrimzelda hybrid game interesting combat real long term character progression effectively infinite quest generator fun action combat wollay decides add progression somebody mods game masterpiece game certainly everyone played game lot back alpha stage game still great fun play definitely enjoy playing would recommend others try played game release since probably spent hours playing one promising games ive ever played couldnt excited full releaseso bought instantly moment came big mistakei gave version chance really alassuch huge disappointment like backstabbed dear friend played game last week since bought alpha waiting six years worth would say game still finished main problems game game design seems like wollay decided start threw things already alpha like exp skill trees favor significantly frustrating item based progression system would problem item based progression system normally poorly implemented region locked progression doesnt really make sense hang glider boat cross region line disappear also poorly balanced starting extremely difficult start white enemies easy quests hope good rng rewarded better gear actually fits class game either way easy way hard fun game played one region knew wouldnt want play unless going start another class lot content alpha quests areas markers map huge improvements game falls short bad game design core honestly sad maybe future game improve possible wollay may change gameplay everyone dislikes maybe combination alpha betarelease game design problem seems like item based progression progression even levels anymore dont even anything really affect way artifacts items get keep besides plus gear affect stats like ridinggliderboat speed theres really nothing keep going levels anymore would able get another skill point get bit stronger thats gone tldr bad game design much item based progressionbad regionlockbad balancingbad contentgood played game alpha beta completely different game underlying problemthe biggest issues artifacts next nothing gear get one region worthless region unless get item little progression game essentially value rest map regions pretty small speaking map map everyone random theres fog war completely explored defaultthe alpha addicting traditional exp leveling system rpg like skill tree add top unexplored map theoretically endless things find loot kill youve got dream game gone hasnt replaced anything meaningfulthere lot changes people like like two aforementioned points think main issues honestly artifact system conceptually great fresh idea dont value think still exp monsters skill tree artifacts bonus stats wollays biggest mistake working alone cannot program alone guess got new fresh ideas like artifact system getting burned alpha game got hyperfixated changing stuff completely transformed game wanted alpha content instead got disappointment got refund played game realized region lock thinly veiled obfuscation lack content within gamethanks wollay im happy waited years thisi suppose ill region lock playtime game played original alpha heavily first came elements original gameplay miss reached endgame quickly became repetitivei love new version allows sense progression area retain original feeling levelling without endgame overstaying welcome heavily encourages exploration sense adventure played original hours beta type thisalot people complaining region lock believe nice way keep playing character maxing equipment best stuff region easily oneshot almost every enemy locking game would quickly become boring keep open mind try look things positive way tons classic rpg games perks trees play absolutely hate thisedit changing review recommending might change laterthe reason game isnt seeing updates changes content run dry something happens review stand right played game years ago alpha build honestly changed theres region locking equipment thats far positive thats less meaningful change find nowhere near enough content warrant price point untrustworthy developer seemingly drop game moment extended period time want similarbetter experience time money play breath wild trove minecraft played game years ago alpha tried first time week ago wollay changed game quite abit since say alot fun alpha beta really nothing work towards current build removed skill trees lvl ups leave zone start start gear accesories got first zone useless next zone go game poppin steam atm wollay swimming money anyway idk something since took years changes played game back im happy playing couple issues right hope fixed later edit fixes came played game back alpha found game fun couldnt figure progress lvling system grindy enemies brutal stopped playing never much funthe beta game steam completly different progression system based finding itemsgear area leads game loop getting better gear fighting area bosses moving starting fresh small noncombat buffs think prestige bit unbalanced atm potential alpha imo somebody works designing games making games see much promise new system different every game able succeed changes probably lots negative reviews people expected beta alpha dont buy game want play alpha waiting till alpha wollay decided go different direction dont like spend money elsewhere one love new changes flawed may still enjoy beta played game alpha thoroughly enjoyed playing every minute ended quitting thought game abandoned heard getting released steam excited played beta got even excited ive consistently playing every night friends im currently level rogue ninja theres something fun addicting despite people raging sure problems base game extremely fun engaging played game hours still like understand game everyone refund played less hours dont like played game hours uninstalled dont plan ever play againthe quest system cubeworld quite boring much different going dungeon clearing even quest besides cant even see npcs might quest youonce enter new region loose equipment even movement items pet becomes weak become one shot anything except weakest things hp also didnt seem increase better equipment equip unlike region tamed inand loose movement items change regions would want use goal getting artifacts pretty pointless thing increase effectiveness movement itemsyou unlock lore regions finding small pieces lore seemed pretty generic short uninteresting even sure lore randomized notyou teleport revival points unlocked already must say least something positive gamethe combat seems quite bad special thing really dodge roll positioning cant even command pet attack removes option use pet make distance enemys strategythere many different pets tank pets dont evne seem much hp melee based pets limits usefullness tank especially loosing hp region changealso keep mind others buying game many years ago developer became silent didnt deliver promises gave supporters promises better skill tree instead existing skill tree completly removed promises rare pets none pets seen yet also many promises werent delivered yet many yearsbe carefull buy game already completly meets expectations dont expect game updated even get promises dont buy untill updates actually wish already added played game alpha years ago alot fun play together othersa lot changed since still feeling plays nice hard sometimes simple fun changes still made creator hard work give time enjoy progress game makesits fun movement super nice combat pretty good looks nicei recommend play together others really different played game first came alpha years ago honestly feels like good quality features taken replaced new unique features dont work rpg dont feel point leaving zones reset jump going nothing overpowered fast hours struggle completing quest getting lucky mage mechanics got staff insanely overpowered killed bigger mob got another better weapon min later im already highest tier weapons played game years ago first iteration released let tell game magical six years later whatever im gonna look magic simply gone cube world fabulous game changes made progression pretty much ruined people old days played hundred levels played till level play levels though amazing system losing progression area ridiculous losing glider boat reigns also absurd combat definitely better classes actually little fleshed dungeons fun personal favorite thing addition items like harp unlock parts map however changes worthless progression changes losing progress pretty much nothing painfully unfun overall ruins experience played first came didnt want leave review answer back hints community dedicated game even subreddit awful alpha felt vast lifeful dungeons looked felt like crawl something hardi want say outright buytry etcgear region lockedthere xp systemlevels arent tied making character strongerstarting area exceedingly tough lot promised features game game gutted wasplus side lot explore doesnt make lack inbetween progression really needed thispurchaseplay risk played first released years ago fell love art style game playsure new version changes heart still really enjoying playing played years ago really enjoyed potential developers seem keep vanishing game isnt great current state ive heard install mods get play time havent tried cant comment personally wouldnt buy recieves steady flow updates pretty much enjoyed actually cant wait new content come purchased cube world girlfriend release much enjoyed earlier iteration game since reluctantly refunded writing review level class progression obtaining xp power character determined gear loot gain exploring starting region wouldnt huge issue gear obtain one region didnt become obsolete moment enter another hope one day reverted want enjoy game much potential best bet would hold buying purchased alpha version game six years ago wollay announced game coming closed beta also announced purchasers alpha would recieveing key beta excited lots talk going game wanted see changed alpha knew said changed lot played alpha pretty regularly year sorta felt likewell level challege left game expect bosses overpowered impossible defeat quests beat without effort great run lasted well worth money spent really liked reviewing alpha different core game mechanics reviewing version betafull release game version different different doesnt mean bad reading comments reviews entered game little nervous almost immediatly killed cow lol like oh wow weak seems lot harder remember played figured new mechanics game work ya know whathonestly really enjoying know many disagree think game well done like game mechanics stand including region lock played game around hrs masteredconquered biomes completely character steadily gained progress travels love design keeps game fun exciting doesnt feel boring like starting enter new biome like challenge rebuilding enter new biome like surge excitment running away stronger enemy kick butt also love feeling satisfaction find special items beat harder quests defeat artifact quest love exploring biomedoes mean think everything perfect dont see things could improved upon diving able hold breath long needs advancement faster advancement hope pets pet foods added id love pet lion devildog hope types quests added artifacts instance could fleshed id like id like see battlesobjects like circle power gain power defeat region covers maybe surrounding biomes youre see direction going world endless therefore artifacts well eventually ill way better diving still hope wollay plans add things future wants ideas ton shareloloverall id give game strong scale room changes improvements game good stands well worth opinion purchased alpha thus experienced game beta still core good game decisions made wally removed almost progression game thus interest playing game cross new region practically starting something simply need purchased game back right would recommend game fun time however one two game loops take anywhere depending lucky get gear drops really worth continuing playingits alright game dont get wrong however waiting years sparse updates developer im kind disappointedalso another thing worth mentioning game windows supportso make sure hardware compatible beforehand purchased way back released game back levelling system longer working via experience longer talent tree would say skip states game rpg like exploration works would say wait salei would recommend worth put least hours alpha excited hear getting full release wanted developer removed leveling system instead putting skill points things actually want use able customize character find artifacts weapons work area currently completely discouraging exploration bring leveling back abandon awful artifact system game would worth lot price tagthe alpha better put hours alpha enjoyed enjoyed beta toothe beta flawless require pretty big changes become masterpiece everyone expected however still pretty fun well worth measly costs tbh gotta bit big old whinger think game worth get didnt meet expectation owed waiting years game quite like sure progression bit iffy im confident devs work something theyve stuck long dont see abandoning really appreciate game ive played beta hours ive beat first region came knowing region resets gear artifacts give minor buffswhich need improving got dive stamina reduction first one treating region like mini adventure defo way go playing game personally treating like region new save file mini story enjoy replay value friends enjoy gameplay tooi would like meaningful buffs artifacts except im content honest lot games days give hours literally game infinite replay value appreciate lastly away random generated world boot map zoom much get scrolling youll ages maps big youll never get took hours one easy region really cant say didnt expect something like still im disappointed time go find alpha pc somewhere really cant recommend game region locks really killed game dont find fun get characters items reset every time go new region change review fix day really desperately wanted love steam release ive played game picroma purchase since release would happily play unfinished beta version interesting maybe couple hours realize exploration combat gated stages find lvl weapon kill lvl mobs lvl weapon lvl mobs etc version cube world insult even beta finally quit large dungeon generated way made stretch different biome since character progress deleted explore new biome weapons armor basically deleted boss room want love game ive seen however currently aint chiefedit really want change thumbs im still excited see game update change become know really didnt want cannot recommend game current state bought game back alpha game become repetitive grind nothing else actively dissuades exploring whats point open world lock regionadditionallyremoved option dedicated server present alphachanged progression regionlocked loot including boats mobility tools water levels especially awful manually swim island island find another boat specific region unheard rpgremoved multiple abilities per class instead opting long cooldownremoved xp leveling completelymultiplayer suffers bad rubberbanding issuesprogression early stages game consists getting one shot everything really dont get negative reviews especially people played less five hours much issue game isnt like alpha anymorethe progression system changed instead simply killing mobs getting xp find relics raise level also raise ride speed swim speed lamp radius etc fun start somewhat fresh every new area would boring one set legendary equipment first hours gameplay kill every enemy one hit alphas system mobs unsatisfying feels lot balanced still challenging loot system improved simply helping supplier gnome get good gear class reason isnt issue start new every area tricky get better gear doesnt even take hour get good stuffguess problem players dont understand first really enjoy cube world love open quite enjoy running across terrain killing stuff go hope future additional features feels quite empty clearing region two could much would nice see features dev showed twitter within past years classes wider range quests would perfect cities would also great see areas map especially ocean biomes hopefully see added soon really enjoy cube world really love much new things explore join friends big difference power think classes balanced also feel grinding much worth think could grind game hours issue like diablo anything like way get bit borders like maybe skilltree even maybe stats level anyway really enjoyed game keep playing thanks vollay hero really enjoy really easy get better gear new region feel people missing point games progression entirely lie

enjoyed playing alpha actually like new direction took betais regular game develop different kind play style good opinionwould recommed biomes awesome really enjoying game ton fun friends region lock stuff different thats makes game different played hour session friends enjoyable would recommend l really hope wollays gonna rethink design decisions without oversight often create unexpected results good bad product really hope turn great sadly really hope dev listens community feedback goes back original concept want like game played lot alpha really hope future game watch alot alpha footage hope game returns versions touch trying achieve beta please keep working hard really bought game advance play wollay improves game lol aint gonna say new playstyle abyssmal execution thats terrible rest still golden really like interesting approach leveling exploration really like game hope people get enjoy like really like game lot loved alpha early supporter gameplay fun great mechanicsbut lot reasons wouldnt recommend game developer doesnt communicate community regionlocking failed promises rollback best features etctheres much wrong game painful soul game amazing really like game

aspects class well coming innovative strategies deal adversaries look forward future patches releases adjustments gameplay game author takes adventure really liked game give new version shot respect believe intent changes however cant say improved game would say improvements overshadowed changes removed best features alphaprosstill roughly nice colorful visualsaction oriented game play still

leveling theres use fighting anything doesnt give gearno skill tree improvements levels character artifacts give tiny bonusesmovement items removed every regiongame quickly feels punishing grind gear starting almost fresh every region unless got gearoverall went alpha could play enjoy hundreds hours full release thats really type game really love game way works region lock allthere bugs think little bit still crashed game made impossible go certain places fixed region lock play first region find gear work next region help find even region travel towollay said going updating game launch things isnt end cube world updatesedit wollay apparently working game community discord pictures dm picture skill tree levels really love game whole heart removing exp region locked items infinite game loot ruins game endlessly grinding goal reward aplha goal would getting levels exploring getting best items dont even wanna explore world know walk one direction lose hours time reasonin short removed purpose game fun factor hopefully game gets fixed reccomending game state really love game hard start get hang start enjoy play hope game keeps evolving future truly become masterpiece potential years ago lot potential today wellthe thing really miss alpha skill trees hopefully theyll get put back game point dont hate direction game going think new mechanics still need work im really loved alpha younger ever since ive following game since heard going get another updaterelease excited beyond words especially following wollays tweets emails videos beta dropped however seemingly large lack almost everything weve seen sure theres things like grand arenas dungeons quests lore many many new monsters itemsthe issue game lies core mechanics seemingly lack well alpha mechanic present almost every single rpg getting exp leveling able put points skill wanted every level felt like getting stronger every level outside equipment good game would able fight stuff higher level gear able utilize skills well beta doesnt though star rating equal terms weapons hit like wet noodle mention gear isnt level one shot basically anything ingame tutorial give info skill either wing find buffs certain classes get would like know basically anything want level progression back bunch new skills drip fed years least somethingcurrently sort leveling system game based around getting artifacts take hours even begin start getting per region unless youre lucky gear drops rich ill get mean per region artifacts poorly thought system think ever seen rpg getting artifact means upgrading utility items yes im talking skills talking lantern radius could buy upgrades alpha boat speed hang glider speed pet riding speed stamina depletion upgrades amount equal dumping glass water swimming pool barely noticeable need many artifacts even becomes slightly useful whats even worse affects things get per region goes final gripe current beta systemper region item locking gear get per region locked region includes weapons armour hang glider boat pet reins instruments used gates stuff get keep crafting materials money pets foodpotions imagine walking shore beach sailing nearby ocean boat magically disappear right underneath basically forcing either go flight point get somewhere ocean jump water whole kilometer get anywhere could also imagine youre hang gliding mountain next region sudden youre dropped sky sending spiraling ground die fall damage outside two get weapons armour needed gotten every single region makes tedious work unless money go buy terrible gear shops small saving grace still laughable gear get makes gear usable defined amount land around makes getting artifacts take insanely long actually go around grinding random random source get gear spend another hours getting gear get riding speed whatevermy final thoughts game follows like cubeworld honestly cant justify purchase basically anybody major changes made core systems really fun punished game wants go around explore id really like see return leveling system skills mean something hell could make areas scale level farther go something artifacts need something least let choose im upgrading get one since useless please least change glider boat region locking thats least could build shown late looked best thats got hyped funif major overhauls go game ill give rereview im going give negative enjoyable way alpha really really want love game fact skill tree removed leveling nonexistence compared alpha makes give good review come removed reason ityou promised features never came really think people leaving extremely negative reviews either havent played game enough simply dont know gameflow actually works game designed playedclear regionget good gearclear final dungeon find artifact better gear allows domove next regionthis increases replayability youre getting bored cause constantly finding new items getting new pets exploring new regions system perfect things wolly improve game needs progression little bonuses artifacts enough needs direction lack direction communication think contributed outrage game ton fun even flaws please dont see region locking assume game terrible many people game beautiful lot id recommend giving chance really think game lot potential back day still stands currently wouldnt recommend anyone unless feel like burning cash patient people im sure folks heard whole region locking thing havent really boils key items glider boat must found region work picked armor weapons disappear downgraded starter gear outside obtained region fortunately gear easy find useful finally problem gear works kingdom every region surrounding region got outside useless yes may take time finish entire kingdom assume start farming gear outer regions kingdom forth long youd like keep exploring monotonous feels antifun hurts honestly id even call system punishing degree know wasnt intent idea behind region lock probably keep game infinitely playable unique idea merit merit could easily multiplied fine tuning im sure wollay pixxie knew would result community backlash folks dont like idea time essentially going drain dont think thought itd backlash degree though cant blame people upset enjoyable mechanic momentwe level although im entirely sure good level represents many artifacts youve found one level per artifact artifacts relatively useless buff things like climbing speed swimming speed boats apparently ones buff lantern radius havent seen yet none means cant fun means every time problems come kind sullies good times youre making remember much fun could theres nothing stopping friends rolling scary mix rangers mages making nearly every enemy game quake boots except enemy mages one shot thats fine always bound balance issues things first come biggie think things started way alpha wollays top bugs though thats good although id lying said happy staminaless wall jumping got patched first day lol jumping sheer cliffsides fun lasted least last probably biggest gripe alpha dogs savage dogs able tamed biggest tragedy ive ever seen really want game fix wollay come back reality hes probably going run money good game think thats fine feel free buy im warning bored within hours sad see game complete uturn wollay great dev doesnt listen community game passion project past decade pretty much understand doesnt listen people sometimes usually better idea try see people want though anyway game still potential wollay ever return could easily fix lot annoying features completely bounce back doesnt seem likely please say something let wollay know way possibly really want love game region lock could know could better hope cash grab scam really want recommend game loved alpha death beta disappointed beyond belief many things loved game removed exp prominent feel like ive completed particular region im starting game due region locked items really isnt good feeling assume players enjoy game first hours really loses charm realize youre starting basically beginning travel new region gripes version cube world ill leave really hope game doesnt get review bombed angry fans think game needs constructive criticism feedback else really want recommend game remember playing friends years ago absolute blast think game people would absolutely love none friends really feel way every time leave region start literally exact game even finding artifacts supposed permanent level increase ability climb swim sail glide ride thats great expediting process finding artifacts process problem dont want speedrun game dont even want play moreto summarize ive played almost hours yet find reason recommend game really wanted game good since good games friends could play many people excited game including friend skeptical game dead years coming sudden kept alpha good luck next time really wanted enjoy game wollay removed everything excited way progressing grinding new gear monsterscrafting thats thats game right every time go new zonecurrently waiting refund really wanted like game really remember cubeworld first appeared youtube inbox big names time inthelittlewood big youtubers middle school im adult getting ready college years ecstatic saw wollay releasing game steam launched game wasnt improved alpha state game bare bones recreation cubeworld region lock skill trees removed full empty promises recommend game good heart anyone current state wollay fixs game state enjoyable ill gladly change review really wanted like game explore different types regions go dungeons really isnt much else game developer released game one heard anything since like game alpha ive pretty much lost hope game wouldnt surprised game didnt get updates really wanted love game waiting years really wanted love game say im disappointedremoval leveling system gearartifacts tied region destroys whole experiencethe music pretty good least really wish could give positive review game current state cant progression needs completely reworked less repetitive new region system artifacts need impact progression level ups actually something scale character stats mage enemies gear level need nerfed desync issues multiplayer need resolved really wish could give positive review honestly didnt wait follow games development years get version missing features made get first place feature roadmap got added years get removed last year development years instead got abortion cube world knew really wish could say game improved since alpha current state really hasnt im still keeping hope get better keeping hope faith wollay hasnt misplaced really wish would bring back level system upgrade paths also wouldnt hurt abilities overall pretty ok although personally think fun play back alpha everyones bitching region locking thing dont find huge issue really really wanted love game hundreds hours alpha version couldnt wait silence broken potential realized none happened wolfram still distant customer support community updates toss suspicions cultivating social media limit negativecritical newsfeedback game hey whatever man world renderingview distance bugs leave character wandering fog never problem alpha content sparse progression region locked repetitive tiered resources arent nearly common justify tiered crafting system much less crafting system first place problem never happened alpha still hope game much anymore put plainly alpha testers dissapointed wollay long dont care anymore looking next thing beta got announced back looking really really hope see development game time goes stands though hours beta alone mention time got alpha last six years thats per hour fun beta alone ill putting time friends easy recommend could one best games year development keeps really really like game exploration alone drew game originally spent bunch hours alpha game different upon beta glaring issue poorly implemented armor progression system really put huge damper game overalli wish could recommend realistically cant got really bored quick really really wanted like playing alpha least hours unfortunately time versions dev scrapped systems made game fun order change progression flawed system region locking currently playing regions see reason continue artifacts receive characters relatively useless nature without levels determing gear get lucky weapon drop immediately makes zone trivial seems like region locking solution typical rpg problem god everything lower level bizarre power spikes every zone doesnt make want continue annoying fact travel items region locked well outside progression numerous things dont understand couldnt improved upon years ui windows small size cant opened unless standing still basic tutorial explains repeatedly talk every npc get quests unless go ocean biome every island point interest towns carbon copies biome specific styling classes total skills whichever specialization youre crafting gear doesnt seem purpose unless youre getting good itemotherwise current owners game still fun least zones recommend trying ocean biome plays like miniature lozwind waker themed area anyone hasnt played yet youre missing anything recommend cube world heres whytldr enjoy game better alpha version first came years ago realize exp system grinding gear instead lvling annoying however opinion exp system back alpha version didnt really make huge difference took long time level spend points talent tree basically get free version like idea moving different regions getting different gear different game offers tons explorationthere basically

buff people complaining region locking without understanding top tier gear time would trivialise content every region removing sort perfect easily worth price remember loved game much little bought waay got released steam say alpha fun wasnt complete least entertaining game huuuge potential wasted minute saw got released steam literally freaked played steam version beta game felt emptier felt alpha happened game sad really dont recommend game anybody many better games prize one goes remember finding game years ago looked couple videos pretty intrigued playstyle minecraft like graphics early september friends talking gonna play cube world digging found game id itching try since day found yesterday decided buy give game go despite negative reviews supposed downgrade bad compared alpha beginning minutes kind puzzling first since never played cube world minutes felt like getting hang game started exploring clearing areas friends finished roughly session still felt like bunch areas explore region although majority might make argument region locking ruins progress made area see addition content game offer adding tons playtime wish powerful set equipment every single region explore tldr id looking play game since come despite bad reviews couple friends decided pick anyway hours playtime still felt like bunch content go continue play cube word simply great game give shot block previous bias go blind ready experience game offer remember getting game back alpha fun doesnt compare fun wollay done fantastic job passion project one things might instantly notice first open game actually music holy shit music something favourite song ive listened far one played grottothe game really fucking addictive really fun playing solo get friend friends ooooohhh man something super fun addictive around nice game settle look side really say game far every time move new zone gear weapons go op zone completely useless mention items collected eg boat hang glider harp etc previous zone vanish find new zone super annoying get use pretty quickly fact find quite fun gear gather everything though understand people easily getting annoyed great game ive pleasure able play early due getting steam key owning alpha highly recommend play solo play friends remember playing alpha someodd years ago game great still great love new progression system especially playing friends allows endless gameplay thats easier newcomers join opposed old exp systemthe new focus exploring new lands opposed endless grind much appreciated change ive played grindy games warframe hours didnt feel right game relaxing going adventure completing region putting game next adventure pretty satisfyingi really hope developers continue update game hopefully bring teased features talked past years game fun music great gameplay leaves wanting explore massive world remember playing game first came still similar back small changes made kind ruined still enjoy game doesnt quite charm remember beta game awesome items region locked feels like cant progress get stronger artifacts buff different regions dont feel impactful mean climbing speed really remember good old days remember hype cube world back day personally super never played release game definitely really different used honestly bad personally really find enjoyable hate pretty big downer new systems different sure thats exactly different couple pretty big issues release arent experience ruining slightly frustrating remember game first thing family bought online super excited back loved alpha much gone back play many times since came always hoping update would eventually come since wollay kept showing promising things update came years later game taken steps forward ways others many steps back alpha showed lot promise really missing depth good gameplay rewarding leveling progression system simple clean colorful art felt like world wanted dive explore full release update added plenty good things id go far say everything good besides region locked progression lack leveling system skill tree like alpha things incredibly essential overall game region progression makes annoyance leave first region anything anything dissuades exploration rather want loss kind skill progression abilities change levels really makes feel like im progressing little matter unless things changed dont see game future hope wollay listen criticisms change game better cause saddens would rather play alpha right remember game first showed cool leveling system lvl farter got youre hoping going get game real person throw maybe figure get good gear need good gear right rong gear get useless go another airy map reset progress saw game years ago moon seeing rpg simple pure one time kinda enchanted fact wasa simple waited waited ready

beta prerelease first found stupid couldnt progress however actually putting time found little easy know fight mid tier mobs blues get go obtain fairly powerful gear quite quickly classes insanely overpowered theres rogue even rogue clearly region doesnt take much time longest part traveling little class balancing would go along waylevel progression needed itembased leveling great without skill tree something makes worth theres reason keep playing sure love getting extra mount speed chances next region isnt even going reins ride pet anyway worthlessregion locked items okay losing reinhang glider etc adds playtime work towards new region however regions dont even half items seeing main reward completing region time upgrade items dumb especially places cant access without items regions dont appear making obtainable regions improve lot thingsmultiplayer tuning important would go along way improve game giving someone option start new character region friend would lovely use gear get carried friend first minutes bit annoying also making mobs reset even someone waiting grave next would nice currently cheese anything long friend sitting grave next trying kill never reset keep coming attacking ult whateverif gets dealt game worth buying however stands aim sale anything probably worth spent hours playing alphaand six years waiting im sure spend lot time cubeworld againthe game

dont worry anyway bought itso see like finally spent money spent hours gaming spent older verion really loved work goodbye still find coming back game fun play adictive relaxingmostly negative reviews come fact game different product alpha true game good either way indeed different productthis strongest argument negative feedbacks game please aware troll reviewswith said hope future updates add

initial release cube world isnt nostolgia change rating accordingly feel entitled purchased demand anything hope creators see devoted fanbase love original concept become fanatical itthe thing add seen critiques loved world destructable know players could cheese way dungeons bombs seems minor fixable loved leaving permanent marks landscape either friends absolute monsters obliterating towns leaving land scarred epic fights bosses really miss boss fights realize isnt exactly monster hunter really amazingly fun im totally willing flexible design changes creators go plan support future content create spirit monetarilythat saidi recommend supporting creators recommend game bringing friends play version current state fun short sighted taking away key features drew community first placecan haz cube world classic release nao plz still love game even changed levelling system since world quests combat better art style one favourite game wont change give chance new game judging alpha especially aud sunk hours alpha everything thought made game fun even barebones statehowever wallay done full game release made bland repetitive simply boringi recommending horrible disappointment wallay obvously didnt care community making game showed shutting scrapping amazing idea game decided go easier route threw steam easy cash grabword wise buy maybe hours content repeats self tend laidback less critical lenient person consider factor reading thisi bought game way back alpha days really fun honestly still think different kind fun completely different gameplay different style hasnt changed like new gameplay isnt bad perfect bad different many humans instantly dislike things different personally still like dont super like region locking thats livableis game liked skills dungeons alpha version maybe game like style find softcore new game region potentially interesting sure good game alpha cube world thats necessarily bad think cube world come plenty hours game play like getting game knowledge learning everything think creatures charming theres game thought would quests items youll need theres crafting tons exploring played another person extremely easy get world fly combat game lovely controls opinion beef game could care less think worth purchase im happy decided continue releasing game instead cube world staying hidden unfinished forever think cubeworld fun way besides region lock would problem level gear based think everything needed said already saidbasicly happened tldr game amazing years ago game abandonded dev due health issues game came back mentioned years absolutely ridiculous updates actually removed replayability progression dev week listen negative feedback bring back desperate hope play people paid fell love long time ago dev thing released hot piece garbage basicly spitting year old alpha players directly facenew players might find fun hours become bored inevitably due progression nonexistent dont waste time moneyadmittedly spiteful fully biased recommend buying cube world think fun game problems region locked equipment kinda sucks leveling system problem mods deactivate region lock reactivate region player power scaling hope update mods arent necessary bring back levels skill tree maybe add subclasses class game enjoyable ironic sort way also enjoyable mods also friends cost less extremely low due customer insatisfaction little content general mods friends say worth think fun charming game progression system kills desire continue playing convince people play dont recommend think enjoyable game updates could really good positive nothing changes change think fun game relax vibe think would fun friends nut dont want play think great game people dislike wanted alpha conntentbut look great new cube world adapt think fun need rework perfect think good beta doesnt explain anything think people blowing changes way proportion yes alpha let explore freely could keep gear level character like every game fullrelease still explore freely going progress sticking region timeive posted forums summarize enjoy way alpha alpha got boring quickly rinse repeat killing things level finally kill things get better gear quest system full release actually exploring region intimately finding things talking npcs slowly getting better artifact obtainpeople still play alpha theyd like im frankly tired changes welcome fun play especially friends think people really reviewing game unfairgame different compared alpha version game balance issues crafting almost useless materials rare beginning hard could hardly beat anything changed subclass scout boom world got lot easier world opened much still barely knew game worked hours ini checked youtube learned game worked remember good old days internet find game exploring npcs important guide places find loot etc check color markers gave color markerenemies tell hard start getting loot things open youyou look negatively towards zones actually really cool loot kinda useless new zone need start almost beginning know game works well things change get special item drops items work outside original zone thats end goalso like exploring please try game absolutely worth bucks think region locked stuff change game really fun keep entretained hours think game much better alpha game alright wouldnt call cube world alpha cube world think beta isnt great getting really close perfect rpg unlike alpha excess features hopefully wollay update post release continue remove features makes perfect exploration game without pesky combat inventory system getting way think game fine pay paying expecting masterpiece unrealistic especially part time project said see people upset game without flaws youre looking game play friends couple hours worth think game fun think people give try creator change leveling system back old keep one needs make wear keep gear region instead losing go back region sucks honestly time understand needs put back normal cause fun wise losing star gear cause different region fun cause kinda screwed way honestly old gear would nice also map go back covered till discover loads fun played old verison game think game pretty good people whiny little babies go new area cant use op loot think game still pretty good completely understand people upset currently still believe definitely worth dont really like territory based gear would prefer xp system game still really fun enjoyable playing friend weve waiting long time finding new version enough think game worth price tag definitely lot room grow wouldnt blame people giving bit time see wollay takes game theres good amount enjoyment current system though longevity game purley based either wollays future changes modding scene one pops game suffer balancing issues class system little shallow ive still good amount fun game overall wollays attention game release gives hope game go even refinements current game game isnt bad especially since whole thing feels pretty great friends play think game would better received disconnect last prerelease final release tried playing release version game could really get think idea game good understand games change alpha release dislike region locking gear dont feel artifacts increase gliding speed item get every zone isnt much tutorial objective good bad different ways time cannot recommend game personally think thing hurts developer ignoring weeks worth valid criticism game ready several easy ways fix launch shoving potentially forgetting first region fun youll get anywhere hours second walk new region youll lose absolutely everything boats hang gliders disappear even youre using second cross invisible boundary get spending hours fighting zone swim speed moment game close worth know something change think game going right direction personally removing xp system mindless grinding fun least personally replaced exploration loot based system interesting im excited see taken said slightly faster boat suitable reward hours clearing area need add tangible fun benefits artifact system think game great far great potential ive already great time new system region locking makes total sense forces player fully explore region see much game glitches beta going think worth cannot wait see dev brings table coming years multiplayer works flawlessly problems connectivity playing friends think game really good couple easy fixes couple big issuesprosi fun playing game progression pretty goodthe talking npcs find shit goodthe items pretty goodconssome enemys way hard like passive healing moves magic really optheir items blue less opinionyou never lose boat keeping things would nice tothe leveling system brought backartifacts something current point pretty bad still

youll likely never see since next nothing gameplay wise encouraging exploration world beyond starting region new dungeons feel almost identical old dungeons new generated npcs lore add little game feel like player spam e unlock map markers missing gnomes least quests find supply gnomesi cant recommend anyone isnt improvement alpha dont think beyond saving cant recommend current stateedit mistaken paid game six years ago receive free dont recommend anyone pay game would also like add tutorial game amazing convoluted set new mechanics completely counterintuitive anyone exposed alpha might expected nothing explaining book rules guidelines instructions either interest new game low theres barely content internet might help good luck completely dark trying play game tried like game region lock probably worthless thing ever also actual rewards playing game tried like every step way uphill battle enjoy tried two classes two different worlds exact experience look enemies minutes find high leveled fight continue wandering around something incredibly strong hiding behind cliff one shots without even seeing tried really tried everything good alpha cubeworld gone replaced shitty new system resets progress reaching another region play alpha instead truly enjoy game perfect worth play understand many criticisms game excited come waited maybe years least think game good game dont mean say nothing improve upon would like traveling little less clunky decided region lock glider boat reins combat fun friends played game enjoyable friends think game fun combat system like

although offput version start gave fair trial fun boring repetitive lose meaningful progress soon leave area progression flat sucks understand trying innovate unique picroma failed unless game severely changes dont get waste time current state hope picroma improve future right id rather play alpha fans project would certainly happier quality life changed improved version alpha dont think would issue developers communicated fanbase pretty shitty regardtldr good dont get want good cube world experience play alpha understand criticism eviews nostalgia general feel game still great happy support wolly releasing game understand frustration many people cube world current version isnt exactly hoping wollay working taking community wants making update encourage update come time understand frustration negative reviews coming game instead character progression driven random generated rpg feels like roguelike huge map little character progression biomesbut honest like game played years

loader game log create character etc spawn type chat setcenter set center universe enjoy game used really like cube world unfortunately believe developers scammers really unfortunate develop game release fun alpha state disappear come back suddenly release effectively completely different game disappear guess wollay pix needed money wonder else theyll try sell years money runs usually write serious game reviews feel like stand community write cube world better years ago today region locking needs go away old skill tree leveling usually dont write reviews new version cube world disappointing maybe change future wouldnt recommend playing game since even finishedi recommend game one favourite waited years got honestly want real cube world experience get alpha waited years pleased everything loved game scrapped last year reason wollay disappeared fact questions remain unanswered still joke opinion another money grab dont get wrong game fun first hours play time soon go next zone game loses magic reset back square one search artefact gives bonus swimming speed pointless want play game find gravitated towards alpha gripping enjoyable whereas game given repetitive boring first zone waited years update played time think new beta version takes time understand mechanics play took around hours think fun explore questing works level hpurs figured ok ther lot controversy want make shortcube world fun game thats opinion game isnt perfect played alpha theres lot controversy game improved aspects alpha like beta nowadays problems game still progression cool explore new lands lores exact thing getting items defeat boss make light shine brighter doesnt really feel like big progression idea items really good think skill tree upgrade ablities missing game

worse dont exactly know describe feels worse enjoyed pressing abilities rpg style region locking far worst thing changed lack overall progression stripped feeling accomplishment feeling becoming powerful getting slightly faster gliding light lantern isnt exactly rewarding feeling take old systems build didnt go remake wheel good thing going everyone enjoyed wanted talents levels abilities dungeons gear year disaster real disappointment waste money waste time see another years maybe youll get right waited years played unfinished version paid good wait wollay decide return since removed buy game option meet expectations long list promises description game page list longer exist game nothing promises simply boring really doesnt make much sense play least meunfortunately happens many

something thought game going live isnt going live past week feels waited six years game say different bad way many things changed like progression system figured things work great fun see lots people getting angry changes insulting wollay absolute idiotic behaviour give game solid try get know systems still dislike changes move dont witchhunt developer one guy fulfilling dream hold anger move ffs really like game turned progression kinda like zelda breath wild exploration based find quests better gear special items exploring world yes first items region locked items find later region also usable regions around current kingdom would make changes game still development wollay openly communicate us give constructive feedback game change change community wollay would like change cheers ps love wollay keep good work waited six years play worse edition alphafirst game didnt load people pointed creator game forgot put dll files friend managed find guy skill balance crap got spawned near monsters times stronger many complainstl dr alpha player dont buy game get disappointed never played game better go watch streamers even better go watch old videos alpha version waited long opinion worth waited years satisfied outmuch love picroma want money back wollay edit still didnt get money back want money back want game good turned huge disappointment progress system worst feel unmotivated play want believe still potential want keep short alpha player absolutely adored unfinished product cannot recommend buy game unfinished product seems devolved many ways unless enjoy gameplay loop consists running around avoiding enemies come across dying repeatedly aggro enemies stronger buy game couldnt force play even fraction time played alpha hopefully communities concerns heard game improved whatever manner needs game much potential feels frustratingly wasted current stateif youre okay hour gameplay loop hours spent running around trying get loot weakest enemies forced reset almost completely upon moving new area game might otherwise probably notregion lock bs want like maybe one day today want like game simply cant first fell love game six years ago hope hope would develop absolute gem game potential becoming instead stand today game significantly worse pretty much every aspect alpha game played six years ago saddens much see potential wasted wollay hope sees feedback devoted fans game nothing personal wollay let whole process sad culmination witnessing today want like game fact part absolutely adore game controls music graphics general environment everything ive ever wanted blocky rpg unfortunately one terrible downside sense progression lost items region locked leveling system dont think theres actually much game respect wollay pixxie greatly delivering us product able progress outside starting area really makes game feel dull closed sincerely hope taking consideration ifwhen decide update game progression really killing want love cube world really unfortunately game disappointment doesnt meet promises set alpha ends somehow shallow alpha lot promise game progression changes ill gladly change review cannot recommend cube world current state lack real incentives progress makes feel like actual waste time playing game swim speed incentive lack actual leveling gearbased progression tied region leveling grinding doesnt matter long run makes feel like theres nothing left complete first regionif two fixed game would immediately become one top timeit amazing content ideas poorly implemented resulted game look forward development improves game worth following hopping problems addressed want love game ive excited years however playing two hours could already tell game fun may seem like lot playtime first two hours game arent fun worthwhile dont see point return send pitchforks way let explain find game upsetting core mechanics game fun visuals great music controls optimization awesomebut problem game isnt fun one core reason game hard honestly bad design dont mean way like dark souls hard fighting strong enemy patterns dodge im talking every enemy encounter one shot kill know theres whole star system enemies certain colors mean higher ranks however issue unlike traditional rpgs mmos make farther go powerful enemies game friends spawned next group level agro enemies walked us got insta killed quests receive early game high level character instead giving quests based star ranki know people complain region locking loot relic leveling isnt problem problem guide players feels like youre never progressing understanding fightingthis game needs overhaul want love current state im afraid ill sadly return want love game however many problemsthe game play repetitive fight mobs high level gear use region get artifacts region level move another region rinse repeat game hard recommend game grinding gear repetitive feels unrewardingthis game much better alpha stage beta complete mess developmentdisappointing want love game wanted since launch waited years game sale likely created internal expectation would never met couldnt met put hours game loved every moment game polished experience without bugs played assassin solo ran none friends game challenging dont suggest monsters much higher health reason could solo run bosses abusing assassin dodging stunning first grab friends enjoy ride assure willthe game enjoyable game fun areas vast fights variable spent casual week clearing first region acquired gear plan move next one wrong gear region locked go back grind laugh along friends restart end clear region achievements complete end goal sight fight waves foes go region region gripe game sense progression lose progression every area casual game friends would suggest five ways sunday solo run game cant suggest put hours even isnt bad game isnt great either want reason move forward achievement clearing multitude regions big bad boss allows one piece armor regions something pushing forward spend hours made worth nothing hurts demoralizing played hours put first days launch addicted love ready write review saying six years worth wait sat thought everything loved love game hurts much recommend majority give reason play something shadows telling fight without push cant find heart lose progress put time effort want love version game gave try wanted accept going back old version game way better feeling going around killing creatures earn xp level better feeling progression version fun game hours shame considering much fun alpha want recommend game everyone sadly dont think game something im honestly puzzled game different alpha needs extreme work ill best point ways games biggest problems could remediedfirst foremost loot system needs fixed regions shouldnt basically reset line progression isnt starting new game plus sort feature doesnt make want journey first region instead like discouraging explorationa way could remedied simple dont take players items instead make farther away starting region difficult enemies better things drop become things essential travel given near starting region instead opt enhanced form transportation first regions mounts hightier mounts like birds something simple like mule slower horse couple regions faster mounts maybe random chance boat item spawn still found via talking locals reward people explore farther transportation leveled start focusing bigger bosses harder dungeons godtier weaponsive seen lot people upset start abilities need bring back expbased leveling system abilities attacksive pointed two glaring issues game ways fix im certain rest community already done similar post mine overall im dissappointed lack things busted progression systems place game still developed people triple company deserve credit credit due cube world still fantastic run around waste time like breath wild type exploration game surely satisfy long youre ok main reward seeing world inhabitants wherein however want deep rpg massive world tons customization give wollay im sure hes still working game im even sure modding community eventually overall dollars game enough feel scammed im hopeful future cube world im excited see game goes thank anyone stayed read brief review game hope find adventure wollays world find fun game still offer want say like game really waited years game going already feeling bit lenientbut cant say heard takes like hours game get good dont want spend another hour running away toostrong enemies empty world good wanted dont really play games like anymore wanted like game really loved alpha doesnt wanted like game much cant seem itthe equipment get game strangely region locked meaning get epic weapon one regionbiome move different regionbiome epic equipment suddenly treated trash equipment return place obtained fromleveling completely removed though game still says level appear almost completely removed save standard attack charge attack ultimate sets attacks appear different depending type weapon equipped doesnt usually change game play muchi dont know man waited years kind update thing seems lost game play value creator doesnt communicate fan base also claims perfectionist presume wants make game wants fine never know game change much build buildi probably still play bit see change mind im optimistic wanted like games full release like loved alpha region item lock system seriously took fun progression game dont see point playing putting hours grinding gear become useless enter new region youre thinking buying game wait theres update leveling system wanted like game mean really game play dull fast travel system wack movement ungodly slow world difficulty rate scale anyway whatso ever tried playing game friends even none us liked killing enemies early game almost impossible unless find weakest mobswhite labeled experience almost impossible im disappointed game hope receives huge patch soon wanted like game couldntto try keep things short progression painfully slow difficult tried fighting star boss one star gear boss health managed damage got melted instantly one star difference im told fine get better gear issue moving new region negates gear try progress massive gap every time fine games one doesnt workthe game gone rpg rougelike good one compare game rougelike like risk rain much fun see much gap games game made something completely different still trying keep things like confused wants rpg roglike neither welli hope game gets love attention deserves manage turn around ill probably go back playing alphatldrgame lot progression issues longer rpg rougelike bad one wouldnt recommend game wanted like game trust core concepts made fun first place taken example leveling progression system incentivized killing mobs replaced gear progression system isnt necessarily bad way implemented incredibly tacky every single region even plains ice ocean requires different set gear hybrid system levels give base stat total gear region boosts stats would much better imo wanted like game played friends place alpha tell anything progress wanted love game muchbut cantthe alpha definetly better wanted recommend game despite flaws saw pieces good game iwerei unique progression system attempted although didnt work gameplay level could tuned something specialuntil proven otherwise game seemingly abandoned sign development despite bugs remaining rampant content minimal worth unless goes sale cannot recommend current state huge fan cube world first released back unfortunately feel like game taken step wrong direction game becomes stale quickly due lack meaningful progression system reward completing zone small boost stats something relatively useless ie climbing swimming speed starting new zone downgrades gear essentially useless start scratch feels like youre replaying first level game hopefully added make game less repetitive progress rewarding would recommend playing alpha version huge fan game alpha cant recommend version young elf always dreamt adventure since child mom always told stories mighty heroes collected powerful artefacts shaped world turned could

youand want wish everyone mean things join hatecommunityhave fun avid fan alpha version cube world assume many dont get game changed everything ive loved shitty grind extra steps early backer game back completely thought game abandoned forgot played game good back alpha dont see anything explains took seven years release matter fact game isnt near fun used remember maybe daughter grown since alpha years ago fun used minecraft obsession anything voxel like right alley bad game could super meh best still excited games future dont think fun right environmentsound design wonderful serene theres lot core issues regiongear based progression great idea increase replayability key items like boat glider removed every single time step new border kills momentum hardcore artifacts could great permanent stat gains right theyre next useless cover things like stamina efficiency swimming riding things basically nullified boat glider light radius lantern really enemy difficulty also bit mess spawn get camped rareepic mobs finding something kill without cheesing takes apprehensive new system big time gear going regions seemed really odd definitely wont find structure like anywhere else ive gotta say actually really fun small permanent buffs artifacts real permanent progression ive found really bad thing like new adventure every region say though miss skill tree alpha like completely different game still love even love maybe traditional gamemode option would cool could either either sheer amount new content youve added awesome keep good work excited game fly around flying longer fun lose glider go new zone discourages exploring starting game literally press every single keys keyboard figure keybinds like made game already knowing keybinds figured everyone else knew minor gripe doesnt affect gameplay everyone else already talked bad excited game came years ago grabbed alpha played friends blast get beta steam gone much character things made good feels like stuff game removed bug ignored put back spawn spot random one character started next super strong super aggressive ogres minutes running like wind got away look town find saw map town would pretty much cross entire map restarted new character wasnt worth hassle start new character get quests go one get completely wrecked mob fine need grind yet cant tell grinding cant see skills used game cant find benefit grinding mobsthis game disappointment compared alpha run hope developer finally chooses listen audience go back drop free start later point seems like ran threw money made years ago needs excited game shame excited see game actually still worked showed discovery queue could get steam key old alpha account huge screw devs sending emails though went start jumped andits game years ago without fun stuff reviews already iterated sucks really suck mean spend years accomplish improving single thing game given game gift really enjoying coop experience one thing bothering spawn point dungeons something simple spawn point first room every dungeon would go long way make experience little user friendlyi also really like game deals moving zone zone makes fun experience trying determine go nexti know ive seen people dont like losing travel items zone like makes zone feel like separate game sometimes feel like character link jumping ocarina time majoras mask link didnt keep gear adventures dont need eitheri think would nice option purchase certain travel items shop maybe random villager sometimes money builds point much nothing spend get next zone would nice could decided buying new gear next area saving hopefully find someone climbing spikes sale next zone happy seeing cubeworld back available steam expected port original slightly changed version got surprise less least feels removed level system replaced item based leveling lot nice abilities gone used weapons feel weak mage warrior little damage besides special ability game still great potential seeing change much worse saddens hope bring back level system maybe expand idea sub classes abilities tree cant recommend anyone playing despite loving game much happy finally see cube world updated hope still give love going forward would love see else bring certainly takes getting used region locked items bad alpha beta people put expectations aside still fun game around knows grow continue grow time could similar mans sky currently still enjoy incredibly disappointed release cube world waited perhaps eagerly rest community thought would much improved version game got gutted carcass game much enjoyed past iterations didnt even run system without patch keep note original versions playable windows one unless install community patch minor prosthere options menu rebind controls alpha lackedyou use wand wizard shoot laser beams like witcheswizards may fought played game alphathere new ways use abilitiesentirely new abilities eg fire wizard make big boom holding shift left clickingthe map fully revealed start meaning always choose biome go rather finding minutes travelingconsthe map fully revealed start meaning longer sense exploration original versions game felt large part game experience alphadoesnt currently function windows requiring community patch even launch said games previous versions could run osthe skill tree skill points alpha gone theyve replaced horrible grindy tedious questboss farming artifact system takes away players choice progression requires farm artifact items give buffs average progression heavily dependent rng god help dont get good random dungeons bossesyou longer make new worlds play dont like one get fact every player exact world yes world procedurally generated however part world truly randem starting areas spawned bad rng make advancement cease spawning nearly every quest dungeon enemies far level deal whopping damage per hitmany items get locked area youre become unusable cross border includes reins use ride pets find new versions items locked new zone entered doesnt seem exploration friendly itthe ui joke excellent help menu available via key displaying every keybind youd need know replaced six little blurbs text bottom left abilities chosen consumable item clearly shown cant see pets friends multiplayer hp bars like alphathere clear indication npcs give quests simply speak every one town given two lines somewhat bland dialogue eachcopied flying fast travel system hundreds mmos usemany things would nitpickssome information supplied friend already past refund policy duration choice explore shitstormtldrthis version took original alpha version gutted sold price first time purchasable years agothis game worth go find alpha version elsewhere developer doesnt deserve money right looking forward game hype really disappointed game fun first party system takes maybe hour friends get star weapons zone crazy easy gear becomes worthless move next zone including items like boat hang glider etc shouldnt reset never able play cube world years ago saw amazing potential bought game today thinking would like alpha tons things added truth game took made game much fun play watch put trash gave us horrible gameplay example leveling exp almost zero items shops biome items good farm best item dont get real fell made cube world great years ago put bluntly consider buying game nothing like alpha happy come im dissapointed combat buy sell items unless game lets minecraft switch versions game go back alpha playing game right one alpha backers game alpha released back one stable alphas remember playing although rather barebones terms content content engaging enjoyable felt worth price even state innow years later lot changed game dont think changes necessarily bad thingyour progression based gear rather traditional leveling system good gear difficult find usually good region found actually find prefer system alphas traditional leveling encourages deep exploration area youre areas nearby rather roaming far wide sticking one place longi also love lore find various regions youre randomly generated thus get repetitive time still believable enough spark imagination world mightve like pastthe repetitiveness honestly probably biggest downside game actual process exploring whichever region youre largely every region fight whitenamed enemies free supply gnome two upgrade green blue etc find various travelrelated items artifacthunting move variety comes different region types explore different dungeon types beat alone isnt enough sustain interest might game youoverall though ive much enjoyed game years feel like worth price end review ill share tips ive found helpful getting game start youll spawn near town figure weapon type like sell rest weapons use coins buy armor andor glass bottles life potions youre talk npcs many reveal quest locations map well level might get lucky get whitenamed area revealed open inventory b default youll see stats lefthand side screen including star ratings weapon armor dont try take enemies higher level weapon rating take stuff higher armor rating youve gotten used controls abilities class youll able upgrade time whitenamed bosses areas drop green rewards greennamed bosses areas drop blue rewards etc supply gnome quests friend rescuing one given region unlock gear next level village shops explore especially dont initially get whitenamed areas first pass talking villagers dont afraid open map scan around interestinglooking unrevealed areas go see whats map also extremely helpful finding life shrines serve checkpoints free teleport points spot reasonably easily zooming way looking white cubes map also middleclick map mark important locations make easier find actually set get friend two play game multiplayer works quite well someone else plan progression help make game enjoyable everyonehope helpful good luck adventures one fortunate support game early development alpha well worth paid dont think thats bad deal nowi havent completely experienced every aspect game yet including multiplayer keep mindruns great pc frames never dropped ram hybrid hddi really like visual style simple everything immediately recognizable sound awesome although wish music played bit often wonderfulcontroller support although youll need use kbm things dont think reassign buttons controllerthe gameplay loop relatively slow first cant safely engage enemies realize value talking friendly natives scattered around world quickly changesi mixed feelings region locked gear took hrs see region offer exception underwater caves coast imagine moving new region fresh start might annoying bright side theres new set enemies pets find maintains challenge remember alpha getting bit boring getting red gear vaporizing everything pathafter feeling gameplay loop dying many times course hrs havent experienced one glitch crash figuring expected character utilizing new qol features new beta character progress felt instant going rags riches fun exciting last time played opened golden door using special item expansive dungeon complete platforming obstacles variety enemies massive boss imagine completing partner would exponentially funi recommend picking game id say asking price fair one many alpha players game despite everything looking forward release years initial purchasethere many amazing things promised alpha release today sadly majority didnt make game questionable ever things people expecting developer showed twitter arent game big cities branching skill trees new classes quest tracker many smaller things didnt make dont mention keep review shortnow gamei didnt play much played enough saw enough know game going completed one full zone played othersthe game plays similar alpha version seems dumbed less skills less control build overall gameplay suffered able outbattle tougher enemies skill almost nonexistent gear everything dont find gear sheer luck hours grinding walking around map hours found first weapon got sheer luck enemies killing dying mob dropping something class simply die little improvement characterenemies dont give experience little reason fight since drops random except finish questsquests extremely repetitive zones seen pretty much randomized quests everything thingthe biggest issue version game everything find one zone locked zone means soon step borders one zone gear pieces weapons even things like glider reins use ride pets gone find againthis extremely frustrating demotivating play nothing really matters explorations actively hindered promoted game exploring questing mind player motivation explore zone finished since gear stats back way started enemies game relentless pretty much everything either shots unless adequate gear game lot potential twitter posts looking promising version cube world many others loved years ago step back hurts see went hope someone find enjoyment game way way see sadly cannot recommend enjoyable one people got alpha release continued playing beta came last week beyond excited hear game finally coming much teased content nothing positive expectations admit may hyped much upon playing beta played began clearing region started felt less less inclined continue playing region began trek new region explore similar gameplay loop alpha lucky got legendary weapon early second region made entire loop seem fairly pointless ran artifact dungeons ignored side quests within region new gameplay feels jagged reliant lucky weapon drop early within region order carry throughout rest region way rewards completing region artifacts give slight boosts transportation misc stats current loop difficult scaling practically forces player restart upon entering new region unless lucky recieve weapon grind one progression comes artifacts boost transportation upon traveling new region lose ability use quick method transportation boats gliders reigns need found within region used even current progression system shoots foot time try branch outsince initial days playing ive felt little desire return continue punishing loop without real feeling reward progressing looptldr current release cube world feels lacking gameplay loop negatively impacts enjoyment game providing real sense progressionas much wish could recommend game friends dont think could current state game would recommend keeping eye game cant recommend purchasing one people played game back like caught beauty came back still pretty cool takes like hours get time dont know youre still game play everyday doesnt bring nostalgia anymore solid game one people played alpha liked game issues heard finally getting update pretty interestedthe direction game went interesting say least still game lacks real reason play rewards get trying get best equipment region artifact really doesnt anything except give minor bonus doesnt build character even make game easierthe combat huge problem enemies dispatched easily good equipment deal rank wise really really bad luck trying find gold equipmentor diamond diamond craft stuff good luck finding even attempt artifacts youre better going new region however play mage encounter gold level mage youre dead unless somehow get hits would like add fire mages mob even r special near impossible dodge likely kill instantly im best games maybe im preachy idki dont know theres going new changes near future would like see like easier difficulty least single play knows maybe people find game easy want harder mode even id like see reason play rewarding experience maybe make levels get artifacts actually mean somethingbut yeah go game least gets work done one early alpha build players loved way things goingive forgotten long time felt rejoiced news finally coming outand im sad didnt enjoy game turned feels like game developer change heart started overi dont like unresponsive fighting feels overempowered even basic enemy feels grindy way progress game levelling system fun progressionthis fun one loved alpha game hyped full build announced incredibly disappointing see nearly everything liked cube world removed full release optimistic willing give game chance purchased game years ago part alpha purchase years ago included vision riding coat tails minecraft heyday going actual progression content quests infinite worlds explore much promises taking away alpha owners alpha owners deserve game promised yes entitlement purchased game known alpha state means would eventually released game features promises laid developersthis version cube world promised sold us somehow developer years development time worked full time game took every feature confirm twitter destroyed promising game decadethe developers dramatically changed game progression zone locking gear creates false pretense advancement player creates earns bb gear gear used kingdom leave kingdom gear earned longer valid lack content hidden false progressioni hope two developers make nms style come back games current vision says otherwiseat time wouldnt recommend game anybody optimistic happy cube world fully released wollay released unfinished extremely fun garbage suck wollay hope single person buys awful game waited six years got hopes sent crashing suck pretty damn excited cube world came back ill keep short sweetxp removedregion locked gear items like boats hang gliders reinsgame wayyy easy cheese ai borked seriously exploited water magic need winnot enough contentexploring boring regions consist types queststhe good thing say enjoyed beauty landscape graphics felt retro beautifulgranted got plenty fun even got artifacts got outright bored itlets hope future added give game engaging less mind numbing feel really fence one say early backer loved still love concept infinite world explore alpha version problems mainly lack depth game charming huge potential fast forward years get game looks plays differently unfortunately odd design decisions made detract whole experiencein essence cube world actionrpg choose one classes specializations go explore randomly generated world get quests kill bosses clear dungeons get shiny new toys sounds great right blast working way first area getting powerful equipment sole means progression similar terraria experience levelling finding equipment way increase abilities catch lose everything move new region doodads worked hard acquire simply vanish start fresh understand concept behind author trying make game seemed fresh every new area entered essence destroyed concept growth reward area artifact acquire gives permanent bonus bonuses noncombat first first artifact gave small bonus swimming speed thats worked hours acquire talk letdown honestly dont mind losing weapons armor effect going harder area rpgs suddenly even ground enemies losing movement abilities boat hang glider major kick rump want hanglide across world sail across ocean river cant soon cross region boundary toys gonea things would help move positive let us keep movement items boat hang glider make artifacts give bonuses actually matter attack defense health loot drop rate make equipment work region right equipment used regions adjacent home region truly make great game game would require complete redesign progression systemif wollay continues update game may change positive right cant recommend excited games release unfortunately failed meet expectation impossible get better gear solo ranger immersion fights gone cheese every fight uselessness getting better gear region reset reasons make game overall unenjoyable experience granted get foothold region starts speed however nullified next region overall futile experience exited game years kept pushing mind remember look wollays twitter without updatesso relase came around estatic played leveling gone skills gone skill based elements alpha severely reducedbut kept pushing finished first zone sailed boat next one boat promptly disintegrated border making worst change dawn progress made locked region reason go back anymore final nail coffin game dead would need pushed back alpha build fixed properly meaning wollays work years naughtas depressing would man go back far throwing version void putting alpha build would better choice better gameand much love style feel game always cant recomend game whos alpha far superior finished product excited game huge fan arpgs cubeworld missed mark region lock gear completely screws exploration top way actually level character gear increases bigger numbers nothing going change spells attacks etc rest time maybe skill tree gets added ill come back nope worth super excited get play many years able enjoy quite bit things need fixed regionlock something could get used please fix travelling items weird youre trying explore suddenely fall hang glider fall boat regionlock alright rest game feels kind bland six years generation regions managed get far less exciting alpha even though regions shrunk since thenthe fog war mechanic maps best thing since brought little bit wonder exploration map fully revealed change kind acceptable since one would like walk hours find single lore altar see clearly map zoom far enoughthere many balancing tweaks qol additions would love probably wont get able enjoy probably waste library bit timeim giving positive review tiny glimmer hope things get fixed enjoy even quickly become negative one nothing happenswell see goes releasesthank sticking game wollay super excited heard game finally going released october couple friends got game dismayed lack depth game everything good game stripped away really disappointing super hyped game quickly realized strange reason developer decided replace everyone loved game bunch mindless changes make game chore play cannot convince region locking items top making character progression gear based literally punishes games highlight exploring release rpg meant exploration proceed punish player exploring honestly change game back standard progression system try right good game cube world much thing followed picroma website talked cute game alpha finally came amazing frankly drought went doggedly followed every random email exchange every desperate drop information show finished product feel like shouldnt buy friends would hate weird progression system enjoyed going hardcore one little world soon needed step new zone fact zero show efforts collected relics time designing wonderful golden weapon ends nothing supposed hell multiplayer experience longer rewards working together rewards everyone going different directions cover ground reforming relics information exchange boring frankly sadly likely wollays last foray game making wonderful lasted sad went weak note prior good made people copy shit went play one ones bought alpha version spent last years feeling robbed professionalism development game playability launch another game devs great idea really good alpha version ruin upon launchthe problems saw prealpha ui buying selling items shops upgrading weapons making things zones intuitive needed reworking game looking feeling good felt like needed add flight boats reasons team people quests pvp groups poor ui remains theyve taken levelling system pretty much worth playing make review short accurateas alpha tester feel betrayed feel like made game fun taken away instead asking players wanted wollay decided change entire premise game removing lovedyes things updated added cost key features longer present game changed directionbasically short feel diabloblizzard announced diablo immortalnobody asked clearly aimed loyal pc audience moneygrab toilet gamethis cube world turned hours worth gameplay rinse repeati still hope game update gem longed waited years sadly alpha players present two sides medal one alpha version player one personal opinion without comparing alphawhen see videos alpha version game played might disappointed drastic changes game took even though creators promised things bear mind game evolve communitys voice describing game would profit different rpg aspects would like see skills indepth character progression would love see rpg elements well bad landscape beautiful quests welcomed addition would like see longlasting quests lore backstories last one region speaking regionlocked items annoying like use boat one region find new one hand exciting venture uncharted land presented new challenge rather overpowered point pointlessly search worthy opponentif see artifacts main goal game gotten main aspect adventure exploration think artifacts bonus completing region rather main goalif idea game let give honest opinion game put lot time game currently lot based luck find right gear find special items progress relatively fast one region one region key found everything completed quests region start nearly completely want go another region progress game questing system improvement gives game depth multistep quests different paths would appreciated character progression currently little nonewould buy cube world right yes would recommend buying though necessarily like games like dark souls bloodborne somewhat simelar gameplay although games much lore story games focus currently character progression exploring world world offer currently game getting sale buy otherwise might want wait updates nonetheless like game continue play start bad stuff progression random played hours struggled hard found star weapon star shoulder everything else sucked found much star things classs tho mabey itemsthen killed hard mob wild droped freaking star bow away went destroyed everything hard weapon zone exploredi picked range class remember years ago combat changed alot cant run shot anymore walk backwords sideways super slow rate firing attack getting ever traped quick sand runs hope cant hit running round round waiting quick sand finish cool said cannot attack moving run circles seconds use kick knock hp means couple hits deadthe mages world destroy range couldnt clear mage towers crystal top unlock lot barriers would given okish gear progress died seconds attacks cant seem dodge hit like trucks even star everything mage boss castle shots nothing itquests quests good talk everyone super hard tell talked would nice like little thing head could go away day something npcs everyone says thing stoped talking random groups running around said stuff look couldnt tell people loops zone twinsgearartifacts gear needs lot tweaking artifact system progression needs overhaul find artifacts around world next lore dungeons ect issue give rubbish stats im talking fight speed increase lantern swimming speed im stats mean add time happy dont feel worth playing leaving zone glider able ride pet make boosts got seem dumb last zone entered didnt get glider done maybe placejust keeping things like glider rains boat forever would change feel game completely finding another zone boost stats instead artifacts artifacts could increase movement speed attacking attach gear better stats reusable game could scale done become super op time see progression feel stronger zones feel traped right explored zone great gear one bit armor dont want move new zone without atleast weapon even feels like done wont carry well almost pointless cant see game going put practice well thinkinformation game offers nothing terms anything like regeneration thought would heal time something nope stamina want change scale map ui f keys controls menu along holding ctrl mouse wheel change zoom character didnt know could click little dots map found teleport got first night middle got dark cant actully see anything pretty pissed spent like googling hitting old twitch vids people playing see working like game timeeven wiki sucks info apart pet snack page also items like glider bell things sitting ground randomly one first things map bell couldnt find thought bugged something ran around like idiot trying find gave killing everything site googling looking got like hours later finding something else siting view bit ledge rather distant point mapnot knowing cant take stuff zones unless game dumbest thing game done sets people confusion disapointment bad reviews problem lack informationthe good stuff look feel game looks amazing runs well hardware almost years old hasnt driver update since sound amazing feel like im playing zelda snes find new spawn point play flute followed getting brighter flute playing makes feel epicthe world explored thought almost zone terms way points stuff climbed tall pillar rock found treasure gem thing guides nearby treasure started running around found chests ground use bombs get small towers hadnt spotted map running around looking treasure went boring looking parts map found sword events places look common anything mapfinding village everyone turned stone cool kill witch elsewere turn back really liked added something didnt expectthis really great game exploringgear gear system isnt perfect terms mostly luck like lacks infoyou start scrub get beat cows chickens sheep start talking npcsthey tell items map places people rescue hunt random gear get though got super unlucky starting outyour gear drops grey tier enter another zone unless end name rare items hold onto find inventory section zone swips left right access like keeps things cant really use apart new stuff gettingthere seems leveling system nothing right lvl find artifacts seem increase things like speed gliding swimming like ideathe game good play bad info mainly form infoso much freaking potential insane given track record dont see game getting updated anytime soon massive shamei wish tweaking done like letting keep boat rains zones going water zone without boat chance finding last island go realthere needs balanced early game gear progression isnt random end like things found unable complete crappy gear making sure gear low level quests class would fix pure luck issueim giving thumbs spent hours playing still want play alpha got steam key always nice hope keep working game atleast hire guy keep going add bits still say im still glad grown old alpha absolutely denying fact mehowever still say little extra effort still worth buy play yes mods suggested makes game something im sure expected come september last yearmaybe time itll become native thing thanks modding community game still worth playing maybe wait sale though wish could get refund tbh wish could give cube world good review simply cannot played alpha immersed able explore without limitations felt like progression mattered leveling progressively improving stats instead version feels incomplete like hollow shell wasbeginning new character absolute pain new points interest nice addition except respawn points guarantee within reasonable distance speaking spawning spawn could location enemies higher tier meaning progression impossible cannot measure determination hundredsthe recommendation give alpha version game minute bugs stability issues soul release version cube world lacks soul drastically changing systems people absolutely enjoyed community remained strong hyped six whole years enjoy game everything slowly becomes tedious eventually love game fade wish could like really wollay definitely step right direction artifact system introducing unique way progression however destroys progression entirely newly added region locking making legendary items go back common game introduces absolutely nothing new first region really game worth playing hours definitely indefinite game expecting wish could refund game wish could say liked absolute crap wish could say fun enjoyable experience even couple mods doesnt even come close game used spend hours playing im sorry ive put much effort trying enjoy game im willing spent money long time ago felt like waste least try enjoy enjoyed world combat movement progression eh hope comes back around good luck cant recommend game anyone current state would im sure folks enjoy even power wish would expand old one worthless wish modding would hopefully get wanted instead something wasnt really even worth buying hopefully get fixed update wish game worked would let game wish option yes maybe like game dont miss meaningful progression alphain version game progress two ways neither value first way gear lacks value bc soon leave region found gear becomes unusablethe second way artifacts items find give minor bonuses moderately important stats boat speed need find new boat every time enter new areait honestly feels like starting ever couple hoursalso fair warning dev history vanishing think hello games mans sky released times long looks like might thanks people liking game wish game good really isnt progression essentially nonexistent theres little bit within regions whole youre either extremely powerful extremely weak spirit cubes pretty solid form progression alpha actually removed modern versions discernible reason world generation pretty good fun explore region locking traversal items greatly discourages wait lot updates things devs said would game launch actually present might better wish game wouldnt freak play multiplayer speed play someone else mps game still laggy idk cause internet makes want play game anymore wish time alpha build explained process behind changes made drastici personally feel like alpha issues progression see perspective wanting change entirely scrap iti love concept artifacts almost useless tiny gameplay difference weapons armor useful one region feels heartbreaking time genuinely great items probably getting near finished region first place going want head another one going another region items useless gone one confusing decisions video game could possibly makei think truly want try game first time good time try one really knows game go feel like hear news eventually really dont understand cube world genuinely hope game improve style movement music wonderful lot new things relating musical instruments artifacts could totally used actual progression system right game absolutely progression feels kinda pointless wont recommend change following things save time money thingsokaymy real letdown reason dont recommend game items region locked means nearly every item get useless change ingame biome doesnt rare rare like got nice weapon region moment step region item lose tons dmg cant kill mobs need get items region etci dont get choose kind bs within procedural generated map infinite biomesalso biomesregions bigthanks reading wont write much review address fact gamers today way spoiled feel need shut games everything isnt served silver platter cube world provided hours entertainment ever since new update getting updates past onei would hate game dev today continue support care game community wonder still remember random foods feed petsdid cat like ice cream wafflei dont remember would say mixed reviews deceiving played alpha im sure jarring starting beta hour give game cannot played like alpha different game looks identical different well game lore regions artifacts wont get details would recommend guide get started tldr artifacts level explore new regions loot locked region making every new region fresh start kinda would recommend game yes easy pick learn depth seems alot fun friends biggest concern developers game done cooking input community shape future cube world hope development continue least yearsedit cannot recommend game developers given dont respond sort contact update game save money would like see different ways travel think sleigh winter biome pulled dog pets also weathercycle would nice always sun shine clouds imagine rain snow lot work different procentage clouds duable guess wind buffs nerfs speed glider would cool feature well would like see pet inon depending wheter bird stick sail boat hard understand different storylines would like suggest books collect information gather would love able recommend game however another case lost potentialif interested learning potentially one biggest letdowns indi setting however recommend looking history game bit honest tragedy would love recommend game everybody far cry originally years ago polished without doubt everything loved game longer fun level locking regions far biggest downside nothing region locked raiding dungeons friends best part way back takes good get decent gear able actually able fight enemies regions changed would happily play game loved friends would love recommend game cant zone system change area entire gear usless huge grind grind sorry want old system back would love say could recommend game cant current price point im hours almost finished first zone realization im going lose everything upon entering new zone makes work progress feel pointless way ensure level progression stockpile resources even seems theres limit amount resource holddont get wrong game fun adventure aspect great ive enjoyed play time dont see point continuing first zone cleared dont think worth usd maybe get something would recommend game current state six years development lot features promised shown scraped final release progression system reworked completely really uniquie interesting approach yet far inferior compared progression system alpha release least current form stats ever improve microscopic valuesyour gear regionlocked personally dont consider much issue might youin alpha version used play randomlygenerated world still generated release version everyone plays seed nowi still hopeful receive updates even though currently looks like developer disappeared would recommend current state diverged far core idea longer game advertised prime example echochamber betatesters community unable help development something could nominated game year likesso sad se potential go waste would prefer mixture progression system alpha rest betain current state game offers real motivation play longer hoursplease wollay dont offended shook third players like cube worldif want change improve game asap otherwise another six years one willing play current state cant recommendcube world anyone offers maybe hours fun playing time isnt worth would probobley recomend sale since game kinda broken premise current foarm still reasonabley fun first hours feel phisicaly stronger altough still tend better time dont rely hang glider pet riding boats begin would recommend game nostalgia wouldnt recommend hate grindy tedious games would recommend game price quite nice however sucks find new gear new region gains finishing region small bigger goal work would give reason finish regions however lot fun finishing one region friends got hours gametime would recommend game side note wait sale worth price tag right would say overall hype really game overall really good game issue getting started game resources rare find likely arent gonna get good gear even average gear start playing tough get past first obstacles people giving choices places feels pressured go things arent powerful enough game early game feel little tough really get would write review honesty believe current state game change would likely make poor rendition post reason recommend however probably harder time accepting fact regional key items regional item progression item progression definentely interesting concept however looking longevity team play makes seem extremely tedious waste time anything like post removal skill trees nice however believe given class skills except one base skill poor decision sortve dehumanizes character making seem like copy paste repeat insertgenericheronamehere love cube world loved complicated knows long till changed even ever however anyone hasnt played beta apart alpha id definentely say give shot im favor changes may anyone hesitant buying game id recommend waiting changes think bit longeredit gave game time plan give still fun truly seems far easy really difficult beggining keeps interesting especially party members however people start getting equipment becomes cake walk ended clearing artifact dungeon bit hour getting new region whereas took us hours clear first region truly cant see much reason exploration play game however key item removal upon entering new region hinders exploration isnt much reason also removed pvp sucks oh well wouldnt play want indepth action combat game thats sort going set disappointment recommend playing want endless exploration game sink good number hours relaxing boyfriend lot fun world beautiful absolutely full variety talk npcs youll find sorts places map go among friends shared screenshots variety experiences impressive artifact mechanic turns leveling objectivebased loot hunt requires seeking lore uncover new gameplay mechanicswhich im finding quite funfor combat think main issue stats scale within regions found almost encounters either underleveled died quickly overleveled nothing could stand ustldr good worldgen good want game exploration keeps fresh rewarding long time wouldnt recommend game currently especially played original cube world current state nothing like original game full bugs strange progression system unfulfilling want full review please feel free watch analysis write review heavy heart really really looking forward back alpha great hoping improvement alpha many years got region locked adventure tedium long grinding real benefit got slow start redo every time go new region get minor buffs come theyre literally useless multiplayer also horrendously plagued latency issues literally unplayable many people writing similar reviews need convincing take dont buy game buy itsince already back first came got steam key free reopen wound thought healed little dramatic whatever im holding hope maybe developer come wood work address issues calls features highly doubt itsuch disappointment wrote fairly long impressionreview beta blogurl unfortunately long steam allow ill quick tldr bthe gistbcube world vibrant charming fun game enjoyable flow im sure long term replayability way progression works gear artifacts condition continue exploring upping skills dont know thats really enough maintain interest game gear resetting per regions barring plus gear feels like negative punishment means feel punished something taken away suspect increase reward would balance outin alpha problem good gear acquired takes matter hours everything became trivial motivation significantly reduced fact got bored alpha quite fast beta attempts alleviate dont know right route admire new take mechanics though always respect developer trying something new props giving goregardless think price point still thumbs bcautionb im sure long itll retain interest individual said imassive recommendation younger audiencesi friendly game kids lights imagination adventures vibrant colours id say also good casual play friendsnice see finally id give neutral review could cant ill say sway toward nocompletely forgetting development communication woes lets see game isthe game thrusts great initial state huge sprawling land explore townspeople talk quests undertake spend good hours slowly grinding gear overcoming great challenges eventually get artifacts area special zones complete move onto next zone wham gone start scratch thing keep artifacts got things give movement speed bonuses equipment lost going different area superfluous level counter going one getat point pretty hard keep going feels much rewarding start new character class rush different zone thereso good game well heck yeah combat great world immerses pretty well problem feels pointless dont get stronger completing zones get faster boats gliders light things bit levels artifacts give actually increased base stats even small amount itd feel little worth nawso get tough call see game bursts hour adventures repeat indefinitely sounds appealing sure go youre looking meaningful rpg progression isnt place id like address backlash game receiving thus far agree reviews say region locking equipment well items hang glider boat cumbersome find availability plus items help continue exploration regions adequatei dont like artifact leveling system currently tweaks like giving actual effect climbing speed etc could great way incentivize exploringfurthermore crafting new items limited regions instead getting crafting books gave couple recipes could used region would incentivize exploring main draw gameoverall experience playing game thus far fun despite many flaws game hope wollay continue work problems fixed get game couldve id like recommend game support windows made work id rather working game initial install rather patchworked game id love take time explain think game needs serious reworkbut like wooley ill remain silent make things unfunremove ya ill change positive game gets better futurethis game current state worth purchase incredibly shallow horrible progression start incredibly weak randomly fight legendary gear immediately overpowered basically punished exploring enter different regions map unless rare gear stuff turns trash real progression artifacts grant things like hang glider speed incredibly small many hours could spent get top movement gear gone go new regions leads incredibly slow walking across mostly empty map die depending traveled map might end walking ridiculous amount get back experience one region youve experienced game offer new regions different skins basically also removed normal leveling system leveling skills overall think huge let majority people played original alpha worth wait hope developer takes feedback moves turn great game potential unfortunately though developer far communicating community one knows game future major issues addressed wont putting time game ill leave since believe development continues issues resolved soonits fun game spend hours time two regions fun toward end second one realised gonna basically first area since biome surrounding weapons fun wish variation like elemental wands instead fire water mage able get firey sword warrior new level system novel serves better bragging rights thing improvements would nice us skill tree put skills increase hp mp stamina different vehicles similar alphanew pets fun mixed enough would cool could put lot effort tame super rare animalsbasically nice see development wish hope get development soon since love concept style game ill start saying game definitely fun first zone two essentially content rest game imho worth price pointthe first issue game starting fresh character way difficult absolutely everything demolishes arent lucky enough find quest early going walking around map talking npcs hours anything meaningful theres also alternative cheese high level enemy dragging life shrine hopefully get yellow weapon class proceed face roll rest contentthe second issue concerns region locking gear exploration items disappear second step foot new zone honestly think system potential right stepping new region effect creating new character carry gold crafting materials think could use get head start region buying crafting new gear locked behind quests complete progressing scratchthe third final issue game thing think could massively change improve state game right artifact system upon launching game quickly realize gain experience confusing played alpha experience main point progression game beta experience replaced artifact system essentially progress zone explore collect gear lore order complete dungeons reward artifact end troubles artifacts might ask well give bonuses exploration items hang glider boat making able move across world faster well level per artifact nifty right decide go sailing big ocean biome youve eyeing boat poof disappear completely practically makes permanent progression system absolutely uselessif wasnt bad enough developer always developing game game passion product hobby refused offer work mojang could work game problem known severe lack communication skills highly doubt listen critiques suggestions people game far development considering hasnt past years simply cannot agree slapping price tag game without intent improve development game money received feedback given im hours say still much enjoy game actually becomes fun time spend playing itits true things drastically changed since alpha also played im personally bothered changes hard part game first steps zero gear nowhere go get lucky get decent equipment mark checkpoints complete first missions theres stopping im currently stars two regions working way third artifacts region clear get equipment carries next ones names could honestly happier im fan cube world however game current state lacking content alpha things wollay posted twitter id like say faith wollay keep developing game adding features shown years ago dont think happen considering seen talk community feedback id like proven wrong though im huge fan alpha version game many many hours game probably least beta still enjoyable lot reasons alpha glaring issues sense making progress game kind gone weapons key items tied specific land basically start dare explore game required exploration see offer huge turn artifacts dont give enough boost considered best items game said still fun time im huge fan changes im willing play every update comes supposing wollay willing make changes betterment game instead ignoring good criticisms would say buy game sale current state wouldnt pay full price mentioned got beta free alpha buyer years ago didnt pay product steam paid years ago none less like open world games character customization grinds game still good one one kind really aware painful flaws break game point making wonder worth working butt get anywhere game start every time exploreedit well wollay huge disappointment game dead real dont buy game go steal like everyone else earlier version better game im alpha player promised different game got currently ill reviewing game alpha old promises didnt existthe good think exploration first region feels really exciting engaging questing feels amazing first hours getting new pets really fun new pets feel really good finding random treasures around map really good combat ok currently needs balancing character feels like doesnt much ways engage combat either ultimatesthe bad game gets repetitive real quick around hours game start realize every biome quest feels pretty much quest always always fight mobs followed boss save gnomes save random person grave yard getting crafting books currently useless region lockyou loose special items everytime cross new region questing mechanics repetitive theyre always nothing special quest progression artifacts used level level exploration stats give microscopic stats something like glider speed loose entering new regionthings improve progression region lock needs rework new quest mechanics need implemented make quest specific biomes artifacts need boost stats exploration stats mobility items glider boat reins region locked found first region kept universal item im alpha player im part picky side fan base im glad play support great game im alpha player review wont count towards score think game worth money least ill happily change mind idiotic systems place get overhaul year old unsupported alpha fun full release game tried hard perfect wollays quest perfect game created game identity crisis makes wish playing game even makes wish playing year old alpha instead full release open world rpg punishes exploring restricts taking equipment gear whenever cross new region absolutely zero progression considering everything gets reset hour two feels pointless thing could think playing good couldve games everything better unless change cant even force play im changing review positive think bit harsh game first got huge difficulty wall first starting actually started fun really managed get hang things obvious flaws comes replayability region locking paper doesnt seem bad practice hard balance think tweaks region locking artifacts game lot better shape game massive potential hope updates dev add new interesting content keep replayability shouldnt shoulders modding community improve game im disappointedthe alpha version simple wellbalanced mechanics perfect base greatest rpg ever needed content like interesting quest system complicated skill tree options character customization redo everything scratch bit undone masterpiece

everyone may fallen love niche little gem video game im going positive voice game would like say even though game still long way go potential fantastic game also remember community beta two people working game yes scaling game broken leveling system poor still much room improvement two devs given six years im expecting end anytime soon game fun btw im going review objectively without taking alpha tweets wollay accountthe positivesgood musicnice designs characters enemieswhen combat balanced funthe negativesno windows supportcombat rarely balanced everything hard easyno servers steam multi tediousno real progressionno substantial unlockspets buggedregion lockruns questionablymaterials like iron near impossible find crafting takes foreverregion progression speed mostly rng basedartifacts substantialall miles wide inches deep true dissapointment im gonna real honest guysits like playing cube world new style bit new content like hrs theres gonna anything left dont think wolay one creator game anything new wanted release get money get sadly us fans get anything actually scammaz wouldnt recommend buying really worth hour content thing im gonna get right point review dont like grindy games hard learning curve game ive started playing alpha came really upset stopped working game entirely brought back obviously excited especially steam less yet one biggest problems hard get feet arguably made worse release get feet one biome restart completely scratch next arbitrary almost unnoticeable changes claiming artifacts formeri love game death unique art style world building theyve put problem eventually get going gets really fun randomly generated secrets things accessed certain items find biome awesome concept love personally nothing beats relief satisfaction feel killing particularly hard enemy cube world overall cube world lovely charming game updates quality life gameplay devs could really amazing masterpiece hands im gonna keep real cannot recommend game state us love sense progression exploration feeling like theyre getting stronger without getting time wasted kinda got screwed loved alpha know wasnt perfect damn better beta fully released game gonna lie loved added music new species vast open colorful lands really wanted make game look feel sounds wonderful falls shorti respect wollay trying something different aint cup tea im happy see game finally released though perfect think great potential room future improvement ive put lot hours even played online point found enjoyable maybe everyone yeah getting mixed reviews enjoy simple things one might overhyped well worth buy im fun im fun yes im fun perfect enjoyable worth think wollay okay job im fun things tweaked better overall ive gotten moneys worth got alpha im much fun game id recommend game people love adventure exploration theres plenty also invite friends well makes game slightly easiercompared alpha lot changed changes strange like adapting new system gear levels items losing power next zone takes bit get used tothere one major issue might come mans sky issue game gets repetitive youve seen locations hope wolfram keeps amazing work im honestly good time matters im honestly really liking game lol mean would nice region locking softened artifacts useful skills explained still think better original im love game right hours ive gotten around starter biome im playing game brother enjoying game lot recommend anyone likes adventure games im gonna say everyone saying better im happy game updated may problems clearly everyone likes path went long see updates future always potential improvement even still like game im liking alpha issue end game progression feeling stale creator solved unusual way like trying something different im loving first reaction region based gear negative spending time playing love makes going new zone exciting makes finding gear really exciting best take exploration seen years dont ever play open world game wish could feeling started well cube world get experience regularly definitely need watch video explaining mechanics etc game doesnt hold hand dont get dismayed get instantly killed soon spawn look colours mobs youre fighting one games could definitely keep coming back always find something new challengingif like open world rpgs youre sick old levelling gear grind cube world fresh take systems youve waiting im loving time game conquering land land im mixed game played came steam remember loving sure enjoy complete area get awesome stuff move next start scratch aspect friend starting would probably less tedious annoying im great review writer easily say minutes playing would rather go back playing alpha build purchased long ago game upgrades make look flashy gameplay quickly made clear game ive playing waiting update forim hoping similar lifespan mans sky least launch bad gets updated something im ready willing sink hours hopefully friends im going expand upon review much points want make already touched peoplei open minded new systems first hoped would succeed wollay wanted doesnt work used infinite scaling back alpha good gameplay mechanic wollay tried switch away new system easiest described infinite scaling without scaling honestly made worsethis much potential tried wollay patiently withstood test time shame cube world im going mention alpha order keep review centralized around core mechanics utility gear gets reset entering new region normal gear gets reset entering new region gear gets reset entering region adjacent region progression mentioned gear mostly region locked meaningful level system sure get levels getting artifact dungeon get artifacts artifacts affect movement speed bonuses climbingdivingswimmingsailinghangglidingridingetc move region region completing one getting reset getting couple artifacts artifacts already received lose value move enough regions away got artifacts also dimishing returns dependant amount artifacts progression movement speed bonuses diminishing returns get enough customizability choose subclasses class difference subclasses usually skills apart cant really customize fight skill tree system adapt fighting playstyle weapon armor customization shell cause region locking cant keep weapon regions would want customize way look going change couple regions im gonna rehash already said game current state review late enough release anything could say subject said say im still fun nothing else good timewaster ive gotten least much enjoyment price number equally greater priced titles allinall personally recommend game im happy cubeworld became alpha use character progression nice land generation spirit cube deep water full fish nice random generated dungeon village total freedom exporation seed based world bugnow weird river shape character progression punitive border everyone map ok lets honest true got nice qol quest lore costim sorry wollay use love game like lot people felt love alpha got years teasing new content twitter shameful cant recommend game im really fan region locking least much wider area region level scaling would better imo otherwise game isnt shabby alpha really best im sure wollay able take game many great elements ton potential turn infinite exploration basic skill tree endless character progression theres character progression exploration reason play beating starting zone everything teased years following alphas launch either removed never added seems like stringing everyone along fact half features already present alpha removed anyone following alpha along never able play dont buy game people never heard cubeworld stumbled across dont buy game either potential hours repetitive gameplay youll able squeeze never worth price tagalso cant expect cubeworlds failures change wollay apparently disappeared hes deleted blog tweets likely gone good good riddance im really enjoying game really happy see much game changed new things see explore exploration fun satisfying combat still fun two classes within class different attacks using different weapons dungeons still blast explore beati wish incentive keep getting artifactslevels continuing play gameplay loop fun going zone gear explore hope progression overall matches progression exists zone individually said love way progression feels zone satisfaction gear upgrade finding sailboatgliderreigns really nice larger scale progression system felt satisfying game would incredibly addicting right dont see playing hundreds hours trying get high level im really enjoying game far pretty brutal first lot guidance beginning first environments really pretty find fun relaxing running around collecting things killing random baddies killed get ambitious slowly getting stronger making progressi really hope keep adding content flesh world still lot explore figure im really happy still download alpha im really reluctant recommend one game doesnt particular shortterm problems problem shortterm progression loop decided switch doesnt hold candle amount time could sink game alpha version stands game best played sessions time decent time gap zones try binge like original release youre gonna fun longtheres still enjoyment title infrequent sessions group friends makes way palatable resist urge push forward people begin checking phones youll burn long timeif dev ever put purchase link alpha version would fullheartedly recommend game everyone awesome way kill week free time group friends frequent basis similar terraria minecraft final state though measure medicine decent experience im really sad say complete let cant good conscience recommend im really sorry since wollay pixxie worked years game said game glaring issues caused game design number regionbased gear extremely bad adventure game lock start everytime travel new place want start make new character travel new place regions looks great nice adventure game dont lock gear artifact leveling want leveling affected train get lucky get artifact region locked levels also really damn bad aritfacts region pet riding also region flying boat riding also region gamma issue really dislike game gamma slider cause issues seeing game laptop enviroment somewhat lit imagine dark minecraft couldnt even navigate around thats like laptop teleporting help still adventure gamewhat years development givemore content buildings bosses conversation everything completely overshadowed region lock remove progression whatsoeverwill recommend gamehell discourage anyone know buying cause noted issues fixed im recommending thisif game gets updated remove region lock put proper leveling system back place change review recommending still believe game despite massive backlash im sad say youve played alpha already played better version game ive played hours feel ive character progression artifact buffs get straight trash gear works surrounding areas rather entire world movement items boat hang glider reins need worldwide well youve played hours game youve played entire game theres reason continue playing fun ive last hours gameplay command equipment lot fun able give haste stuff thats pretty much thing recommend game pretty sad even say update review feel like update made changes move game better direction moment chiefupdate turns cant even use command equipment anymore thats definite thenupdate theres actually mod allows gear transferred regions also hang glider boat reins makes game thought going lot fun youre gonna buy id suggest trying im saying someone never played cube world alpha thoroughly enjoying playing game solo friends im new im good game beautiful people seem complaining alpha makes reviews huge bias would agree region lock bit extreme completely removed toned would also love leveling skill trees added extremely fun rpgs exploration would fun motive get specific items areas available area items region locked imo neither hang glider simple items like love game exciting first experience youre debating buying game youve never played alpha would go ahead get played alpha make choice honestly im fun far ive played hours day bought game im disappointed waited waited waited get instead taking great alpha creating complete deep world experience get gameplay loop designed discourage time investment robs player satisfaction killing monsters looting better gear questingnot thank goodness alpha build still works im excited see wollay added cube world steam definitely help game grow prosper wife manage bring updates cant hate team two people taking forever make great game takes alot work effort im glad see wollay still wants grow game dream started great game matter long takes since alpha ill till dream reality enjoy way im glad game finally massive changes original alpha release final product im sorry one likes game mrcube update point right please fuicking waste money steamcomoverwatchplatinum boosting im sorry partypooper alpha player feel like current verion game huge step backwardsi fond memories playing back eagerly waiting new patches never came nowthen saw coming steam omg hyped obviously sat made character decided stream game show viewers ive talking excitedly past week beforehand sadly hour session filled nothing frustration disappointment sadnessi missed level skills system could barely anything anything didnt good time alli pet said mountable yet couldnt figure actually mount sure bug needed something clearly wasnt explained ingamei simply felt lack progression purpose play game anymorei sat alpha kinda weird time sad alpha much enjoyable beta versioni wish basics feel game kept game today bought game years ago feel kinda betrayed know mean im sorry give game bad review really loved alpha hours sunken game beta changes dont seem work removal xp system exchange artifact system gives benefits playing removed whole progress game grinding levels equip leave zone current equipment gets rendered basically worse basic item thought hangliding nice well leave current area lose things like start start addition pretty neat skill tree got removed progression regard either gets changed sort progression preferably old system maybe mixture satisfaction getting good gear would really recommend state cant im sorry im sorry mean love game really big update worth wait soon feel done one area need restart whole process im still going recommend game best game rather still fun play solo friends games style alone enjoyable random generated world actually good choice level bit questionable best something like equipment level idea covers also enjoy area equipment work toward set universal gear keeps level travel areas would like see content mobs destinations real flesh regions also think changes level could really polish character side things add little npcs world feels alive would make game near perfect im sure everyone heard issues shortcomings took years move alpha beta became lot less fun imo simply cannot recommend game current form misses mark long shot needs major redesigns remotely fun dont count though given devs track recordone word really sums disappointing im sure youve read plenty reviews game isnt good im tell completely true cant upgrade abilities like really nothing work towards point hoarding weapons cross border spawn lose amazing stats loved game cant recommend game current state im writing review alpha
