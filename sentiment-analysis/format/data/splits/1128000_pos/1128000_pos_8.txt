purple item pushes ahead forcing lose strength spent time building engaging lot people youre okay constantly starting far strength concerned game never explained core mechanic gameso negative reviews justified people bought game thought something wasnt upset rather enjoy game first two hours almost quit frustration finally learned everything needed know take entire two hours figure play game review isnt guide didnt include everything know like classes weapons specializations work fact need one understand basic gameplay mechanics ludicrous im going honest rating game would depended price spent quite bit time playing previously friends huge part reason iw able much fun didbut realistically beat one area youve already done entire game isnt much fine love mindless things games kind gets boring region lock isnt really big issue werent thing next area previouslyive seen called gameplay loop honestly thing guess end game nothing youve beaten area stuff repeated wouldnt care much things next area different theyre mention soon cross border start walking either way fun bit dollars worth fun long years cube world released beta today alpha vet got enjoy game week advance done god begin game focused exploration wollay sure everything power make exploration mindnumbing facedesking repetitive dull grind worst offender region locking every biome map region full magic items equipment work area set one foot outside region items region immediately rendered useless really inhibits ability go region totally nukes ability anything especially hard enter say ocean region didnt get lucky find boat first island visited like youre going bvery unfun time b regards equipment incredibly rare chance youll find equipment plus used multiple regions conquering four regions ive found one legendary item shoulderpads items make exploring areas bit nicer get punished wandering farthen theres progression system made clear levels skill trees entirely gone matters gear gear rng based also region locked trek across land finding special items travel less tedious avoiding anything stronger almost everything low equipment levels trying find better gear sure nice get stronger better looking gear able conquer foes leads towards tackling artefact dungeons boy artefact dungeonsartifacts goddamn useless saying right seriously first time fought way tooth nail artefact dungeon finally made end chest artefact inside looking forward map said increased lamp radius range measly metres opened chest got artefact felt proud looked stats lamp radius gone didnt know say knew artefacts waste time almost scour lands lore culture pretty neat get past lore knowledge lore thing increases knowledge culture shows artefacts culture across multiple regions upgrades artefacts give teeny tiny additions travel abilities tied special items anyway sure improvements arent region locked miraculously theyre completions sake dungeons usually give decent equipment loot besidesin regards lore real purpose seems help find relics youll see npcs wondering around world often faction tag druids mana cult desrist gronot cult kingdom gamodt thing tags seem determine group npc adventurers hostile theres faction quests faction leaders long questlines faction strongholds capital cities meaningful faction anything etc lot teased past years weve come see none also easy forget lore stuff isnt written ingame journal anything youre told dates heroes wars forget doesnt matter anywayalso craftings useless region locking sense investing materials one region unless youve gotten really unlucky havent found good enough gear oh wait need find crafting books make legendary gear whoopeefinally rather easy criticise complete lack thereof developer communication wollay wife infamous hermits emerging hovels year show stuff cube world half hasnt made games beta release state sure things may change course absolutely idea things change dev duo arent known taking even valid constructive criticismwhile dont hate game gotten fun world set feels hollow ive come across couple interesting things like entire village petrified witch went killed witch breaking curse expecting like validation efforts villagers didnt seem notice one might like villages leaders anythingoverall cant validly recommend game state alright fun friend conquering regions map felt little reason go already felt like id seen everything game offer hindsight didnt feel like something thats gone years work vacuum game probably worth since cube world alpha exists definitely worth anything straight worseheres whats worse new versionlist skill tree character progression start skills dont get stronger way cant sort inventory cant zoom scroll wheel zooms map binds zoom dont work leftovers never drop class useable thing received rings amulets gear region locked including boat hang glider seriously wollay must trolling nobody could possibly think thats good idea people say get gear complete zone still rare get item ive seen one drop course different class ninja completely ruined might side effect skill trees noted ive played rogue stars throw second cooldown beginning game find waiting cooldown damage literally anything killing mobs rewarding exp mobs far open world would issue previous point wasnt true crafting useless region lockinglistnow whats betterlist map nicer teleporting im sure good bad though exciting find portals alpha music added bosses easier determine kill less unreasonable amounts health although unreasonable amounts damage still world bosses sort worth killing unlike alpha gave cubes often couldnt used pseudoquests daily quests gonelistyeah thats find alpha version play long ago purchased game unhappy uninstalled totally forgot ita months ago started wonder cube world almost like asked friend told moved steam distribution result reinstalled reacquiring key currently ive put hours still dont know feel gameso races jobs specializations thats getyoure dropped world little

traditional region locked fancy armor weapon picked int eh starting region yeah worthless crossed invisible line hours put get point could solo mobs without kite friendly mobs yeah gotta againits different concept sure im sure really bestcontrols fairly easy graphics cute colorful voxel game retro feel isnt unpleasant tutorial guidance game play game isnt going thing actually best thing compare minecraft figure game play got figured funhowever first hours confusion frustration left something desired think game potential considered finished productreluctantly put game biggest problem optimized areasconditions impossible play three quarters game fine game pushes last quarter thats unplayable fun anymoreand lastly pleas keep mind people making game whole peopleim sure jobs outside programming coding please dont rag much like huge professional studio staff ell least yet game better could hope gets better still game gotten lot flak well deserved flak due changes alpha beta however game general bad game game recommend yes game well executed finished product still potential yes much soas single player game fun enjoyable bit timepros fast paced fun combat exploring

combat system still pretty tight enjoyable qust system makes region much robust alive alpha version would like see reworking crafting works maybe crafted items theres definitely still work done core concept think worth trying played alpha honestly believe alpha better finished gamethat doesnt mean dont like really new levelingsytem horriblethe problem region locking enemys way strong areas starting low lvl gear makes exploration impossiblegive back alpha took quite bit time actually enjoy game needs work overall might worth sticking around wollay fix said radio silence wrong cant communicate fanbase needs someone liked pretty sure youll like first hours unfortunately dont feel characters growth much problem game character become weak enter new region thats whats issue youll consistently level character person played alpha version noticed lot improvements great game youll get tired play hours however lot fun solid game worth wait end game balanced around multiplayer

gamei say though music good fun leave first regionand procedural stuff impressive sorry wollay coming early buyer wanted game well progress well messed big time sorry wollay dislike changes hope mods change game base vanilla game nope wouldnt say worth hope wollay comes back game dont think sorry much loved game journey towards release date recommend buy developers incorporate feedback people giving something past years sorry say game dissapointed mei fanatic follower cubeworld since alpha got released game isnt anymore every feature made game fun taken away game shadow exp skilltree cant even keep gear going new zone progression make finding artifacts permanently increase stats stats provided artifacts subpar barely worth effort real reason engage combat since exp stuff monsters drop dissapear anyway crafting isnt neccesary either need tons mats best craftable gear cant even keep things worth crafting potions basically point anything gametldr rpg without features rpg sorry years

released version tsk tsk tsk sad releasethe alpha much promise perfect base create fantastic gameyet wollay managed change game point doesnt make sensecube world exploration yet game actively punishes exploringwollay added region locks means gearloot essentially null void region one gained means start beginning every regionlevelling removed skill trees progression game cant progress levels also cant progress better gear due region lockingthe map completely visible means lot excitement exploring removedoverall would recommend avoiding game wollay listens fans changes game shame come back edit review cant give positive reviewi one people bought game back years ago came back school back played game whole weekend wanted moreafter month game died completely updates received minor fixes bug fixes controller supporti really enjoy game back high hopes future cube years later receive steam key alpha ownership dont get wrong thing back minus school part genuinely loved game point going gift game many friends make full party really enjoy game week passed despite promises nothing came two weeks started getting negative like many others already time full month release updates game received prerelease phase impact alpha updates developer went radio silent notice patterni hope one day ill able change review leave positive one developer cares community like one inexcusable look somewhere else fun game play friends heard minecraft modded pretty good super fun first gets boring quick sure love dying hour straight stupid high level monster starting zone best game ever kappa sure different alpha game still awesome know isnt normal rpg adventure game like every differently unique wayyou take zone little contained adventure variety themes keep interesting theyre like questing campaigns progress unlock nextyou start fighting white difficulty green blue purple finish yellow gear get shown colours know youre good enough fight level monster hard game dont understand basic concept realise whats going becomes much easier progressto help new players feel developer implement small starting island use tutorial guide people systems work let face white monsters drop couple green items face green monsters get blue drops etc shown get teleported land based biome play game real least done get someone new startedthe game issues fear much longevity different types biomes visited experienced started hills biome dont wish enter another hills itll however quite different varieties get dont expect quick game done likely wont want repeat previous biome types course helped game updates introduce new lands play developer continues development past launchone particular issue experienced started ocean biome stranded village island confusing new player couldnt find monsters kill villagers explain could see lands distant thought surely im expected swim reach hadnt known time ocean biome required finding sailing boat first teaming friend played able understand doin conclusion fun game hard people making best look game works jumping take watch inthelittlewoods basic guide youtube get excellent start sure different alpha game know loved completely turned around core gameplay understand everyone alpha playerbase theres lot fun especially friends take game purely fun experience opinion gather friends like region based system youll lot fun doesnt mean game doesnt come glaring flaws need fixed though artifacts almost worthless plus gear way rare finding quests frustrating twenty euros theres lot playtime lot fun especially first time playing biome type time youre done youve got well worth money switching review dislike like friend blast theres game thought would exploring gathering powerful gear isnt difficult started new area completing first area dont lose everything traveling new areas either full restart like people claim one problem gameits region locking install better progression mod game perfect see cube world learning curve people leaving negative reviews either didnt install mod theyre plain bad video games noobs everywhere map generation game absolutely astounding better minecraft also world map beautiful thing ive ever seen time play spend good minutes exploring map beautiful world full many hidden treasures im still finding something new time play theres also many different creatures discover tame like pokemon lmao want experience games full potential install better progression mod shouldnt hard find popular mod mod also works multiplayer make sure mates installed toospeaking multiplayer seamless easy experience invite friends steam theyre inbuy game play friends worth dont bother listening filthy casuals theyre salty theyre bad game game amazing cant believe waited years game finally ive enjoying far really happy works idk cause im honeymoon phase might like later far good still hope added time likely scam early access cash brought quite years ago played lotit fun game lacked real content lot grindthe addition teleport spawn points nice helpfulbutits step back since like anymoreit released dropped update years counts dropped update came along something fish money steam ea good game buy youre allowed kill many slaughter maybe make nwsw mod aswell axampel give dog pp also gives ugli monster called rock man comes sometimes kill mountian buy gives better item axample gold ax one shit shot monsters everyone kills changed biome everything items becomes useless canot use become shit okay sistem someone like someone dont likes mybe like bittle lit dunno also gives hidden yiff owo uwu succy sexy fox pp nice fox pp nice everyone like fox pp big knot swallow cummies choked suffocate pp yeach game good buy allowed tldr like alpha probably wont hoped wollay please respond communityin current state needs work really hope wollay responds community instead going ghost another years loved game alpha doesnt really feel anymore lot mechanics made great arent im sure right move different know cant start square one theres still much good beta many awesome ideas planned earlier old website cities skill progression etc people wanted disregarded mention undesirable new changes region locked boats hang gliders gear removal skill trees leveling dont know game put week beta drastic changes got hyped im sad hope find courage face harshness communitys criticismi consider changing review wollay listens community even little though best track record tldr game worth money dont faith developer ability deliver gameupdate still new content fact updates past first weekthe truth new content added six years took update come game moved sideways yes true game still built great foundations alpha revealed reality game still alpha quests repetitive flat boring combat okay nearly engaging enough thing game going say want new region locking artifacts main problem main problem developers lack motivation ability make real gamethere little risk buying game entire gameplay loop lasts hours always refund time wish could leave positive review enjoy game currently expensive maybe im wrong edit review coming months updates turn around tldr try become beta player dont salty alpha playerhonestly really good game buy try lot negative reviews coming alpha players waited years game go beta didnt turn expected ya cool features gone still really cool game totally worth region lock isnt bad anyway make sure getting item moving next zone use items adjacent zones got item also working hard one zone allow find bunch lore easily see artifacts arei recommend game highly although believe artifacts difficulty could changed think artifacts give better stats becomes case think monsters get harder away starting zone change artifacts difficulty help game thrive tldr cubeworld good game still needs polish theres promise thatll happen tell game made two people somewhat emptiness low density doesnt make badcubeworld game immense level hype behind since first announced hype gotten ahead enjoy game would recommend need updates reworkings make game worthwhile play beyond first biome completeyou see cubeworld rpg stripped leveling system instead power affinities based gear thing gear works biome found spend hours character one biome complete fully restart whole thing next biome find boats hang gliders free unfortunately also usable within biome found means ocean biomes involve lot boring swimming manage find boat also unfortunately due lack rider skill ride pets get reigns also cannot taken biomesthe overarching progress make relics explore far wide find lore points assist locating take dungeon get minor stat increase faster swimming climbing better diving slightly increased lantern light radiusi wish rpg elements wish catered overarching experiences push go biome biome rather please particular reasonthe combat good hard first later hard cross biome border ive played almost exclusively ranger sniper using shadow clone ability double seconds every minute use ranged attacks advantage climbing mountain tree shooting powerful bosses making sure stagger fall right near top perch rinse repeat get good gear dont need cheese hell difficult encountersthe warrior started hours ago much powerful basic enemies due ability heal percentage hit getting enough hits also makes bosses harder due decreased damage taken increased damage outputim going anywhere ill finish saying like could still use polish got borderlands terraria feeling get good rare gear also starbound feeling nothing specifically matters cant really get attached area youre passing rather making truly valuing enjoying itedit months later honestly game somewhat hard come back first areas every character definitely needs content hope comes faster game tldr dont buy game dont definitely worth timei originally bought game years ago released alpha expected beta full release arrive relatively soon least resemble alpha boy wrong took roughly years beta full release come alright wollay made amazing promises would added game wrong beta full release dont even resemble original alpha game promises made deleted gone awol simply dont understand wollays reasoning yes game thousands paying customers simply havent received payed forwollay simply took game game leaving couple hours fun best havent played alpha iswollay cant even handle crititcism agree people bit harsh awol since sept simply unacceptable tldr thing alpha released game updates right beginning left yearsyou dont screw player base two times think thats okay waited years getting drip fed updates game expanding going bigger skill trees sub classes indepth quest lines playable races even talk building house settling city one point supposed cities huge aqueducts stuff better dungeons think even hints puzzles dungeons going coolbut doesnt matter talk expanding game something great lie get instead opposite got smaller biomes map arent even skills anymore feels like released version prealpha build get game wants really shafted us usi never understand couldnt keep us loop come updates periodically couple times year even something show work done receive feedback people actually playing game people willing help give feedback anything could help game loved believed could even set forum like respect points something active respected players community could idk doesnt matter wanted kill game deadim upset cool game excited believed long potential wasted tldr trash dont waste money itbought alpha hoped would one day become nice game didnt gave one point actually forgot popped steam went fetch alphacode activated steam tried still waste somehow even managed reduce features game compared alpha looks like last attempt getting cash itgameplay wise kinda fun realize steps really really boring way works go city grab quests get go andventuring freeing merchants collecting good stuff like better gear glider etc youve done go next area new set quests thats realize progress made previous area simply nullified quests cause appearantly dev thinks thats cool next area start scratch sounds like fun right also gear bound zone found guess means gets nullified aint great game hrs true gameplay lacks severely fun proper mechanics department overall steaming trashpile questionable yyrs ago yikes tldr game fun cyclical future looks brightlet start saying ive playing cube world since bought back im personally glad see changes made since wollay promised fun game thats exactly still thats say think stop years ago cube world ambitious indie game boasting combinations game mechanics one ever thought infinitely scalable rpg part thats exactly said game far perfect regionlocking items charm first becomes grindy first biomes artefacts scale stats small percents thus become less less useful collect dont grind dozens monsters able sail ride even glide immediately kicked enter new biome find collectables resetall aside see great start game still high hopes future hopefully publicly available help demonstrate areas game need changed rebalanced order bring best experience possible tldr relaxing exploration questing solocoop game unique way progress great soundtrack fits exploration part worth wait money would wait years againthe game never lost charms six years waiting update approve added cuteness quests monstrosities songs buildings mechanicsyou pet pet heck yeahevery npc somewhat different message damn love compliments styledid community complain worth waiting yes absolutelydoes community still complain complaints justified really yes way progress different game ive played still cool engaging mechanic lets focus exploring also focus gamedoes progress mechanic need fix somewhat rewards artifacts feel underwhelming comparison stay one area changes like every boat find makes boat go faster able wear gear everywhere would awesome prefer levelling system new way progress absolutely maybe little changes mentioned tldrfun fun friends severely punishes solo players six years market seems like features removed addedexploration actively punished enemies still massively overpowered others massively underpoweredhere go wish could say wait worth im still glad game enemy mages appear level player still destroy health bar area start find things kill easily many kill easily wellcombat improved little severe disparity power immediate opponents pets kinda useless die easilyoriginally could buy hang glider use anywhere find one new area find one next new area find another climbing claws dumb alpha game leveling would make stronger let improve climbing gliding combat abilities find climbing claws area climb eternity leveling isnt really leveling combat improves looting items go kill enemies loot kill stronger enemies loot kill even stronger enemies loot crafting system still little annoying crafting large amounts item eventually speeds taking time craft items games isnt balancing simply inconvenient waste time dungeons used best part game rush

punishing exploration players receive loot classes use way often completely possible win tough fight rewarded one piece loot use weaker already posses along three pieces loot classesim glad game seems instead adding features features taken away tldr horrible multiplayer experience dont play multiplayer bad reviews yet good game wait sale edit changed recommended multiplayer still unplayable due synchronization issues still havent fixed ok nearly everyone complains aboutall true every new zone means new equipment started playing game knowing though actually bad game really different playing

customization weapons still thing still cool wasnt literally didnt matter game theres reason improve weapons thats fine though im patient person even though slightly disappointed kept playing really kill stars occasionally melee stars even hours game ive shown little improvement ready grind watched video telling go things help travel get boat hang glider climbing spikes sky whistle harp bell still improvement thats fine wanna get slowly surely feel satisfaction come across first sky island im really excited immediately go hoping sort combat buffwell got hours game got star great mace class everything couldnt fight died little effort felt like someone cheat coded game take straight end beat star dungeon basically soon started rewarding fun take scaling enemies leveling system cool dungeons replace rng system feels bland every quest area hard took seconds wipe lvl bosses rpg get lucky drop win game go hope thing happens next region tldri cannot recommend game anyone current

something whether thats killing enemy xp killing boss loot stays forever find something better simply exploring map want know whats beyond fog war whats next biome going excitement unknown sense

every time die come back die walk another cynical part almost thinks cash grab might running low funds alpha key buyers understand anxiety issues listened player base maybe expand team people game could something amazing came years ago understand people internet mean us like take given wanted enjoy game takes get used new mechanics different would expect rpgs im actually really enjoying honestly think people overreacting somewhatone things people dont seem like region basically restart alpha reached level time kinda run things version theres incentive complete quests game never really gets point everything easy tedious game experience travelsal chore therefore exploration damaged terrible cash grab wish wasnt blinded hype game waited reviews roll bought terrible decisions dev made final product worth installing would strongly recommend trove damni really enjoyed alpha version years back terrible game years development game feels empty alpharegion locked gear joke time get best gear region pointless since move onto next anyway top important items boat glider make actually getting around map somewhat bearable also locked exp skill tree remove thing made player feel like continuously progressing characters actually gave purpose killing mobs artefacts joke way come close replacing original system benefits actually provide laughably bad practically none existentthe good changes opinion new map inventory thats itdo favour buy game terrible update polished alpha version released thatthere real progression game nearly everything pointless redo every regiondo buy game unless enjoy starting game scratch every time venture past region thank waiting update created character serious note game alpha days something lacked alot content yet enjoyed many hours im glad something finally happend got update years later cannot say find cube world fun anymore wont touch alot others done greater detaili fully understand wollay created game truly hope learn communitys voice carries importance choose go forward releasing game hopefully one day change review positive good game destroyed eh hours first gameplay fun progress mechanism bad lose stuff switched region dont recommend buy game fixed version better year dream gone know know dont enjoy years nearly silent development version game alone january wollay tweeted screenshots game still including expfor reason wollay changed core mechanics last months years updates got something like version januarywhat seemed like refined alpha would outcry people would still mad taking years people would loved refined alphathe current version suffers lack real progression first hours reason venture new area lose real progress made changes suppose help replayability ended killing games general playability powerful gear feels way easy obtain main form progression doesnt even feel earned gear system feels like wollay realized bad new system refusing revert old system artifacts practically useless making feel form overall progression throughout regionsi see people saying things like isnt suppose alpha never promised game wollays make cant agree alpha show less polished version final product look like case alpha seems well thought version game got gutted rework parts game cube world seems target whole different audience rather targeting people bought twitter main form periodic communication long wait new update saw improved alpha longest time game suddenly changed year justified people shocked state current yes wollays game shield criticism especially true turns lot fans current gamewollay spent years seemed refined alpha threw work away spent months transforming game fundamentally different version game would love make review recommending game currently cant recommend even bring play version alpha better plain simple husk game oozing soul game able sink many many hours despite alpha state removal gaining xp killing mobs seems questionable seeing character level way level acquire lackluster artifacts give garbage boost eg increase much light lantern emits also used skill trees class appear axed game something else ive noticed biomes seem less dramatic interesting alpha makes wonder world generation also changed maybe thats rngtheres also myriad features wollay teased didnt make way game ironically pantsonhead retarded feature added game regionlocked equipment remember

extra things could added later many fun systems removed game experience systems pets less skill tree etcthese systems replaced gear based progression system lasts hours hit top tier gear get around players reaching endgame hours developer thought would good idea cripple gear progression player worked whenever entered new region enter new region characters power set back zero forced start even lose glider boatyou get around neighboring areas using gear however gear exceedingly rare take multiples hours find low tier piecegear based progression done properly seen terraria absolute worst implementation ever seenif goes sale could snag fun friends base game fun decent bit explore quick game giving little motivation go another region completing area alpha great full release let would recommend anyone buying version wollay updates game probably never alpha worse came balancing however better exploration wisetldr get game want balanced multiplayer experience alphas design superior honest opinion region locking feels like punishes player makes weaker ripping away gear worked hard get polish game alpha absolutely clear shame took different path terms design one seemed promising cant recommend game honestly bums looked forward release years cant even recommend game sale art style still amazing glimmer soundtrack wonderful listen everything gone alpha different game improves seen steam library review positive many features working fine build take away game basic fact developer ran game shows dedicated seeing game well thing grabbed money ran still waiting single update game hasnt since release best game played undoubtedly best game ive ever played ive since initial release like beta fun first got bored run around new regions getting equipment gear back region lock gets changed game could amazing big lmaoski big oof biggest challenge game right convincing players bought game years ago current game progression gear vs xpleveling based better access years many bitter pill swallow mind made one system delivered different many giving honest chance almost afterthought also essentially early access even past week good quality changes feedback given convincing brand new game try regardless negativenonconstructive reviews written quality negative reviews quality positive ones game different anticipated bit hesitant well hours regions cleared enjoying system even though quite different traditional rpg trajectory kill mob get xp get betterfasterstronger rinse repeatoverall give shot open mind like biggest disappointment game years good example communication crucial game development process biggest problem game developer released alpha set expectation game actually released different alpha made people angry different look reviews notice majority negative reviews make reference alpha majority positive reviews thats really need know played alpha expecting something like may like game however played alpha looking something another cookiecutter rpg chances may like game like came current state isnt worth playing empty shell tried really hard enjoy game cant developers decision change game gear based progression system terrible idea feeling actually accomplishing anythingyet like years ago word developers planning next even went far delete blogso anyone interested purchasing game put time money something else central conceits drew people excited game silently thrown trash six long years spent cooking absent eyes bothered giving time money energy first placethis beyond starboundlevel mistakeif excited cube world isnt game changes alpha certainly baffling confusing honestly give chance definitely perfect dont like everything thats changed wollay tried something new progression get every similar game expect pretty sizable changes way implemented right world beautiful exploration combat super fun rewardinguntil start next zone zone dozen hours plus worth content maybe hold buy alpha think worth playing changes made game since alpha make absolutely sense whatsoever seems developer took loved mechanics game replaced shittier mechanics really makes question thought process implementing changes concept great idea fact hunt artifacts every area encounter terrible way fix bring back lvling system instead hunting system also make enemies get stronger get stronger way encourages work hard lvling another idea might help game travel father away first spawn enemies also get stronger ways help game concept game awesome wasnt pulled well first many bugs already ruined game one equipment disappearing also whole leveling system annoying pointless people want getting stronger killing enemies without even leveling pointless really underwhelming could become great soon major fixes core game lot fun absolute blast playing beta first day unbeknownst would happen step first region character never progresses past movement speed combatexploration mix like playing two different games doesnt feel like complete game since full release expected feel like full gamecube world absolute blast game around hours moment theres real reason keep playing since move enemies dont drop better items gold etc mention loss movement items like reigns glider etc pls fix core gameplay game good major issues show hours game look tips play get friend two fun whilethere big issues torn recommend positives barely outweigh negativesdo go game high expectations playing hundreds hours core gameplaycombat enjoyable ever mostly unaltered alpha returning alpha addition many new featuresquest types issue stems lack progression options wont take long till devs come one another ways fix definitely worth purchase like voxel styled adventure rpg games core game really fun proper open world adventure explore zone freely tame pets craft gear potions explore dungeons fight enemies quests get new key items let access locked dungeons bonus areas open new travel options including reins let ride pet progress given

effectively reset letting experience climb top food chain bonuses artifacts permanent stat increases zone artifacts getting point collect zone takes somewhere hours gameplay loop fun gameplay loop unusual like lotwhere gets controversial progression system end collecting artifacts gaining levels levels counter many artifacts artifacts collect main goal game give small convenience bonuses might cleared last zone small percentage bonus hang glider speed slightly larger radius lampthere higher level zones training character goal like getting level enter dungeon big bad boss anything conquer zones collect artifacts fun nothing elsethis turn people especially system change alpha even though like game different adventure zone wish levels meant wish something permanent reward adventures miniscule bonus convenienceshopefully theres going content added later make efforts meaningful id advise treating game like sand mandala accept impermanence enjoy process crafting system broken spend hours collecting wood fibers make weapon armor piece make go shop feet away always something better items shop cost gold way quicker gather crafting materials theres point crafting collect gold items thing worth craftingi still play game combat still pretty fun always fun add new pet collection dungeons dont good challenges patrols need hide makes unsafe linger one spot clear room aggroing one stationary soldier time youve reduced something easy whenever find secret treasure room cross fingers cool weapon armor instead bag money good thing dungeons bosses parkour rooms pets dont die drop lava pit follow younew regions explore cool found cocoa beans ground got excited new fruit collect snowberries oceans boring completely deserted everything happens islandsalpha felt finished enough complete game missing quests full release feels unfinished hope keeps getting developed though stuff feels unfinished would like crafting system fixedthe steam review forces choose yes wish could choose neutral would recommend friend could play multiplayer cube world release steam nice breath fresh air alpha version played shy hrs say enjoyed far continue playi give cube world current game absolute downgrade alpha version added content quest system world generation incredible good matters little game broken core content removed process regionlocked progress lazy way artificially increase playtime doesnt give sense progression since everything goes back gliding speed progression without counting artifact upgrades get progressively weaker accomodate dumb idea lot cool actual fun content like skills skill trees others like enemies structures didnt make game infinite progression system alpha great seeing character grow become stronger stronger felt really great could actually go wherever want stopped strong enemies could actually taken player skill impossible since strong enemies take damage also skill trees helped complete control wanted strengthen play character needed options wouldve perfect sad seeing game current stateanother reason negative review lack communication developer attitude true talk game developer since modus operandi hurted game worth mentioning since probably ruin game even future expect game get better example new progression system wasnt ever mentioned years updates wouldve comunicated drastic changes game playerbase couldve given useful feedback changes going ruin game developer also habit staying silent answering questions clearing doubts sometimes may help players lot apparent dont care feedback want develop game way want okay course correct people bought game promise updates hope wouldve improve change abomination whole thing unprofessionalcheck reviews theyll surely describe problems game detail better mei think lesson avoiding feedback playerbase create game one likes case change direction one asked sure listening every complaint playerbase idiotic avoiding completely speaking avoiding dont buy game better spent somewhere else cutest game ever perfect game want explore listen beautiful music joy see characters animals much work put game definitely worth buying developer disappeared without word years really tells everything need know level support customer care expect buy game give developer money literally thousands indie developers work hard listen feedback support customers deserve money go find developer straight scammed everyone steam please allow refunds devs need work game hopefully fun fix fact language menu option non functional index number go negatives full release tell plenty state gamealso mind game also security flaw enables enabled people forcibly join gameno remote code execution yet tried fact windows support ridiculous heard rumours due dev simply liking windows thats true alone big red flag first hours great cool dungeons fun mechanics scaling difficulty horrible essentially leveling level every region combat gets quite repetitive ive seen alpha looks much better terms leveling scaling abilities buy unless like repetitive gameplay first hours good since lose gear move another biome game get different second time play reward get completing biome leveling often money start get slight stat boost could gotten rare gear use biomes ads experience repetitive would recommend playing liked alpha play alpha full release steered far away usual exploration gameplay first id say hours game blast second land completed start get little repetitive easily worth bucks hopefully updates come extend long game remains fun overall good game first hours awesome whole loosing gear changing zones xp skill tree randomly generated worlds etc defeats purpouse originally loved cubeworld alphai remember first character reached level still encountering plenty challenges lots fun friends changing zones like loosing everything end goal games means understand nothing look forward stop playingthe artifacts original way level sure id rather xp bar standard skill tree let us choose specialise choose fast boat skill points make artifacts uselful maybe add level artifact level knows could buff abilities better stamina less fall damage rescources harvesting bushes ores artifacts good idea misused arent rewarding friends tryharded hours star dungeon piece gear youll customize learn love let go forever artifact makes mount pet faster sure glad since havent even found reins next zone cant mount anymorewollay love game late revert loyal fans used loved much faith eventually turn tides pull mans sky us make great game rise first hours slog learned navigate region got first good items started really funthen time move onto new region fun dissipated didnt feel like progressing felt like starting isnt enough content game keep hooks items disappear marginal bonuses artifacts majority playtime dont apply characters actions anyway would call justifiable reward resetting equipmentthe progression system needs hefty overhaul feel rewarding considering buying cube world urge wait least changes made buy lot hours fun elsewherethe game amazing potential cannot recommend current state expected much full release still feels like title alpha stages development disappointing first game amazing everything going needed additional content make truly something beautiful version released everything wrong devs messed bad beyond im hoping update fix mess would suggest future buyers wait update purchasing first hour bit scary carefully avoid mobs far powerful got swing things pretty great game cathartic though sometimes bit difficult looking forward balance tweaks really cant complain first region fun may well make new character cross border gear resets real point everything againgame maybe content isnt worth first time heard cube world looking games like minecraft pc time literally potato even minecraft wasnt working saw cube world concept even better looking sadly wasnt released yetthe year parents got new pc could play minecraft friends another year later cube world alpha releasedbought day friends picroma excited really lot fun playing itbut time passed almost everything could explored everything could find alpha waitedi looked informations cube world every month since years passed like water desert discovered cube world beta would released steami happy long years finally one favourite games time would updated even birthday like birthday gift maybe best one ive ever receivedday friends lot fun playing thisday realize years life wasted looking informations game downgradedbut hopes high thought developers would continued working thisbut didnt actually disappeared im fucking middle school since wanted play game go college realized game never existed never exist know developers game husband wife sincerely want ask teach child maybe break every dream avoid delusions foundation game solid unlike people think region locking gear fine two changes think would vastly improve game would artifacts give combat related buffs lot potential roads go straight stat buffs interesting things could change build build lifesteal crit combo etc would make region feel unique would equip different artifacts youve earned compliment different dont region lock movement items boat glider etc instead provide buffs items find subsequent region buffs artifacts give essentiallythere things would make better well relatively simple would add much game game nice time play hours day sadly start way slow help given game definitely needs work nostalgic real cant wait better combat update region lock changes maybe helpful guides new players us played alpha never learned game definitely needs updates bug fixes besides still fun game play either alone friends although exploring areas collecting artifacts get repetitive especially since items dont carry regions besides cute little game play hours mods easily fix problems mentioned game delivers best visualy landscapes creatures far music love could better introduction new players game animations combat new ways fight mechanics abilitiy obtions instance interactive dialog important easier difficultyis worth kr yet potentional game fails proper meaningful progression artifacts get add noncombat stats would fine stats buff buffed insignificant amount lamp artifacts get light radius pathetic artifacts random buff discover know buff dungeon tedious discover gear making cant even try max one stats half near useless theres climbing diving riding sailing hangglide lantern light swimming climbing speed rarely ever useful every cliff ive come across easily climbable mainly use jump tech scale additionally climbing spikes make climbing speed useless diving less stamina used theres almost nothing underwater rarely treasures thats another stat gets upgrades dont need swim speed avoid water cost unless already boat boat youre swimming wasted stat lantern light lantern starts illuminating around basically nothing upgrade like get anywhere noticeable youre going need upgrades lantern actually helps see night good upgrades riding speed hangglider speed boat speed thats sort upgrade said upgrades pitiful amounts barely amount anything thus making review long winded way saying theres nothing really cubeworld aside maybe hours gameplay solo hit hour mark youll either tired stale progression constant resetting character starter level lie fun thing sure explore biome newish time thats really pushing biomes pretty awful explore youre stuck using flight masters get movement items like reinsboatsgliders make empty spaces points interest shorter game still shell could looks developer interest going walking away fine theyre quietly without even much letting us know sure game feels quite different alpha thats bad thing years work would strange game felt exact far enjoyed game good amount would recommend othersnote many people enjoying game due region lock go reddit get mod unlocks regions basically fixes game game gets lot flak actually think sucks single player game cooperation fun times fosters though multiplayer experience amazing finished first zone im even mad ill able given time region locking great way provide replay value thing id wish given boat mostly islandic region game flawed progression system discourages exploring world whole concept game presented first came innot new nonprogression system doesnt work actually real downgrade game back alpha new features dev introduced us via twitter feed arent gamedont buy developper never really communicated fan base regarding strong critiques beta truly realise mistake make cube world outstanding game supposed game good foundation years foundation shape considered release cant recommend anyone spending money game large span paths take game classes specializations means total ways treading lands cube world say put time dedication game pays really well experience amazing game dedication put even though people leave bad reviews look hours game versus people left good reviews playing game enjoy walking around seconds dying game truly fun explore thats point game explore region lock great feature dont want overpowered every single region forces start back work way different dungeons structures lore nice touch well something cool game feature allows learn region conclusion cube world good game game lot potential something great set back design decisions bring enjoyable gameplay grinding halt note yes play alpha therefore see developer going drastic changes changes could worked less intrusive intrusiveness features addressed likely would played much longer felt positive game overallfor context beginning game feels extremely slow enemies kill near instant travelling around foot extremely sluggish forgivable player starts game player starts obtain powerful gear tools faster travelling theyll feel strong sense pride accomplishment eventually obtain powerful godlike equipment effectively dominating enemy daring cross path biggest issue rears head player enters new biome conquerthe egregious change overall entering new biome players gear matter level may rendered next useless player could taken time obtain full set star gear downgraded gear worse basic star level gear would drop area combined fact player also lose tools assist travelling sends effectively right back beginning game things kept consumables gold pets crafting materials none however really used help get effective jump start new biome also keep effects artifacts previously obtained effects permanent upgrades players movement speed using certain tool light radius lantern increase negligible though motivate keep clearing biomes themwith mind big changes would make order system work much better far important dont completely neuter player gear entering new biome player rarely find gear work within adjacent biomes originally found theyre rare usually stars anyway simply good enough instead reduce number stars player gear entering adjacent biome would ensure player brought notch likely starting star gear grind gameplay screeching halt like beginning allow players quickly travel town new biome best place find initial quests begin powering maybe allow flightmasters let travel biomes main town straight away modest fee maybe friendly npcs walking around could point right direction always notifying town location first player yet discovered make artifact permanent boosts substantial give us option choose boost select similar skill points back alpha make increases get exponentially lower player dump boosts single stat example first boost riding could provide extra speed every point onwards capping speed less used skill swimming lantern could get much substantial percentage increase per level along higher cap much situationalanyways goes hour life hopefully developer sees main critique fixes glaring issues new system groundwork much potential hurts see tarnished rotten gameplay features game lot problems super different everyone expected bought alpha back happy version thisits certainly still possible enjoy game think flawed buggy fleshed dev uh problematic really would suggest stay awayjust play alpha game lot improve thats sure great base improved big improvements compared alpha version terrain generation way diverse balanced quests dungeons diverse meaningful even perfect new progression system better old one got equipped epic gear progression stopped make sense randomly generated lore well implemented pets tame bosses fighti get critics come people played game released alpha state paradigm game lot different opinion thats bad thing like new progression system think needs balanced thats allacquiring artifacts needs meaningful player regionlocked gear think work time ive played feel problem drop rates gear works one region big bosses probability drop kinds gearitemsarmorweaponswhateverlooking forward see comes next game game quite slow start get going pretty fun complete region lose gear kind disappointing hope changes artifacts new way leveling give qol boosts future still recommend game lot fun years ago release new version well game changed lot development good ideas game still feels mostly empty repetitiveyou start choosing one classes game warrior rogue ranger mage class unique weapon skills based weapon currently equipped game gives little choice moment maybe different weapons per class class also access two specializations moment mean unique active spellthe world split several regions biomes contain quests points interests start region gear work quests points interests get better gear process starts difficult become incredibly easy pieces equipmentnow thing every time go another region lose gear except rare pieces start process previously didthe goal game moment obtaining artifacts small passive upgrade small mount speed increase small swimming speed increase make level level useless moment get artifacts usually complete hardest challenge regionto find quests points interests automatically shown map speak npcs region indication whether tell something useful sometimes spend minutes town talking npcs nothingthere little variety quests points interest almost always matter biome kill rare enemy find item clear dungeon dungeons extremely similar makes quickly repetitivethe combat system quite boring enemies deadly way damage without dying hitting stunned likely able stun use specialization spell mean spend time running kiting mobs wait spell cool stun enemies damage repeatone biggest problem game far apart things often spend time walking nothing uncommon spend minutes moving next destinationwhat bit sad game currently progression system except artifacts small boring passive upgrades alpha version progression xp system regions set level needed match gear permanent game skill trees removed least nowcube world dream many people high expectation share dream understand amazing game could yet correctly incredibly difficult seems wollay troubles getting right formula seeing game changed lot past years seen twitter dont feel like game right fun alphato conclude wouldnt say cube world terrible game moment quite low content quickly find things real purpose game lot diversity content artifacts actually useful original upgrades game could fun longer simply casei would recommend buying game moment unless seen gameplay convinced going enjoy hours game changed lot since alpha however though progression different games new version continues gameplay biome plays almost like new game think addition music quests moved game fully realized world though game may lack wanted features skill trees basically thing removed alpha overall experience enjoyable play one enjoys exploration games personally appreciate work put game wolly past years high hopes future game reading blog long alpha even close dream game changed bad theres wider breadth flavorful activities take part alpha systems removed luckily game progression systems theres certainly discover cube world alpha player youre looking make numbies go glorious dopamine shot comingsome tutorializing missing prerelease version obscure key displays keybinds looked didnt really know skills theres fun discovering new cube world ticks game changed since alpha still really fun game play friends game issues starting like playing russian roulette game starting properly broken game multiplayer terrible broken cant chat friend using ingame chat different maps tell someone correct im wrong seems game abandoned really hoping game amazing dreams crushed game lost meaning sense progression shot say idea artifact leveling novel breath fresh air execution said mechanic hand leaves lot desired movement stat boost worthless grinding per region enough gear attempt dungeon feels really boring constrictive mod called cwtool id recommend downloading reddit removes region locking gear special items anyone interested makes game way bearable actually really fun friends though current state would avoid game really painful launch really hope game gets better game nothing wrong change yet fine onethe game still playable cool plus many things got added makes game alot location gui ui pets ranks making game pretty lively plus comes good timingsuch find legendary npc interactionsones questrecommentionnormal chat makes sound structuresand bet even didnt countyeah everyone getting sad skill tree removed im fine game depends heavely equipments sureno leveling time git actually gud make tactics like pro never use ce exp points lol game plenty potential updates keep coming help replay value artifact bonuses region lock enemy scaling ect feels unfinished pointless completing one zone im hoping updates keep coming would recommend buying game game potential even post alpha state issuestldr downfirst probably biggest problem imo spawning region mobs seem random levels place able kill mobs starting zone frustrating run like minutes find something actually without one shotted flying radishes isnt good designsecond fact hang gliderboat region locked game literally travelling find something locking methods faster exploration behind quest per region unbelievable third overall region lock would make sense form permanent reward better swim speed increased light radius level ups never felt meaningless seriously make items rare global items scale rarity tier item suddenly dont feel like im wasting timetldr bad couple major problems probably easily fixed mods somethingedit mod fixes problems game honestly loads potential think people stuck region lock cant look past see game alpha anymore people need stop comparing alpha think game could certainly use improvements right game perfectly playable honestly would recommend anyone wants game fun laughs friends course one people cant see past region lock idk dont buy game honestly game worth every penny paid game current state fun worth price tag game hasnt many lovable changes since alpha ill say like changes needs meaning like getting artifacts gives extra effects abilities power scaling artifacts also would like way use key items outside region think way fix would give region star rating get higher region star rating get bonuses effects key items say stamina cost effectiveness duration even power upgrade sorts think game current state fun needs little overhaulupdate love game concept cant support developer runs first sign criticism game current state pretty game gives direction isnt normally issue becomes issue spawn system youll spawn randomly set world may able damage monsters near spawn kill hits dying like times simply gave game straight trash belongs dumpster game simply fun highly recommend game purchased game downgrade compared six years ago want walk world filled emptiness game trust wollay deliver final product update game would rely moders one pretty sure going remain quiet run away money want something like cube world would recommend looking forward veloren insteadi want type shit got wrong leave like waited six years update realize fewer features available beforedisappointment game fantastic idea wish like alpha though meaning played really sorry really need change game cause gonna last long right hope dont take personally wollay good hope make right decision game lot fun times challenging needs lot work done progression loot still fun experience biggest problem upgrades get character mostly disappear hours region lock small upgrades character dont get stronger game shell former version game everything made cubeworld decent stripped away youre left half assed gamethe game spend time taking away progression awarding whoever thought region locking gear great idea delusional gear joke honestly doesnt sound appealing grinding actual progression artifacts knowledge reward movement based bonusesalpha version version buy friends play game actually really good really easy play new friends always go new area explore together youa realize isnt game alphab enjoy playing games lots friendsthen game worth buying interests game alright lacks alot core gameplay features replayabliltyoverall im feeling light game amazing believe watch streams youtube tired recent games basically hold hand way cube world isnt like huge fan legend zelda series cube world similar many aspects cube world learning curve sadly lot people cleaver enough figure still learning making basic guides soon peace game rpg roguelike dungeon crawler unlike alpha version version replayablility first didnt understand gear region locking played realized much enjoyable alpha versiontheres world bosses dungeon bosses quests monsters pets ride unending exploration much much game bad even good abandoned developer second time updates game cant recommend buying even kind

check cube world subreddit rnotwollaybutok see people tinkering game dogshit current statedont even think buying worth developer dipped game got released people didnt like one knows went even coming back game support game enjoyable fails live expectations im horribly bored hours compared version certainly fails deliver hypethe progression goes painfully impossible distastefully easy items determine skill level actual ability play unlike used version combat much enjoyable competitive played pvp servers countless hours consists clicking pressing r shift time time enjoy quests losing powerful items upon new area totally fine still craft decent quality items taken area without penalty dependent npcs progress makes exploration rather bland change pets power level nice freely switch pets without xp loss find basic yet important items game every new area frustrating hinders enjoyable gameplay items ex glider boat climbing shoes etc found per character glider used favorite tool explore world outplay enemies pvp sucks even found artifact improved speed marginal hardly tell lastly ive seen many people type agree amount time effort needed clear stage marginal improvement random specific thing unacceptable without type leveling system future updates ever one cube world die good timei hope game improved inexplicably still love game cannot good conscience recommend game flawed way doesnt explain anything happens make feel cheated still provides enjoyable experience development continues become absolutely fantastic game game flawed yesartefacts feel like satisfying reward hours exploration put regionthe balance classes barely present seriously try water mage tell reason play fire mage butthe core gameplay loop potentialthe gear based progression allows anyone hop join friend even random players need get gear go new region able play teamthe incentive explore whole region find gear gear used accross several regions next exploration faster also good prevents issue alpha level skimmed regions find place farm legendary weapons region worth playing actually nice visual guide reddit see optimize exploration smooth playwhat determine game really good upcoming

open workshop mods community make game want game help developer get ideas add things workshopjust idea save gamerip cube world updates game fun landbound system doesnt mix well absence rewarding global progression would advise waiting couple weeks see devs handle postrelease youre playing alone aim multiplayer watch guides jump game fun opinion able play game hours getting bored even though way many people disagree believe worth buying game fun first region youve crossed another region resets gear grey quality items boat glider also gone regrind stuff another region youve crossedthere skill trees exp way level find artifacts artifacts doesnt even feel rewarding increases small stats swimming speed climbing speed hang gliding speed etcthe music great game fun confusing first time play recommend looking play startwhile game enjoyable gets grindy awhile complete first area thats really thing new areathe real fun seeing monuments biomes seeanyways worth play depends like grindy games plenty free timeif dont like either probably game youps relic system sucks could least increase base stats instead increasing random movement stat like switch back leveling system like alphapps barely recommended played hours friends lot fun friends solo much game fun dont like system easily download mods interneti like alot without mods game good come long way development lot fun especially lot friends qualms game zone ranked randomly difficulty instead spawning go harder gets along items tied zone youre feel like least key items like glider boat soul bound regardless zone great game certain mechanic choices wish werent making game harder inconvenient game worth money people play yes developer need change mechanics yes still play game regardless dealio mechanics yes game good combat system way hard game good game fun im enjoying time difficult recommend even motivate continue regionlocked equipment exists consistently feels like im punished progression wanting explore incredible world feels like im set back every step forwardthe game potential become one favourite games time however current state cannot even justify bucks pricetag think youll enjoy probably id wait sale big update game good could better also people seem say hard long grind dont think true far quite easy enjoyable friend game great lot potential wollay pioneered new system progression entire game took lot bravery think deserves respect inevitable lead lot negative reviews however think continue add content game slightly tangible endgoal work towards game perfecta great foundation hope continues build upon game great grind hoping still cube world like game even though gameplay tweaked lot read game buy odd game expect classic rpg want adress something elsei played alpha lot surprised beta wasnt near massive respect wollay breaks issues releases game proud game wants beeverybody realise passion project wollays let man make game shoot dont like change want everything set mind spoiled brati hope keep working wollay deserve game great perfect balance simplicity freedom tied together thing holding back lack depth progression however foundation progression apparent alpha whilst may seem like step back im convinced time wollay find perfect blendignore die hard alpha fans telling game trash dead wrong game amazing back got years ago region locking kinda ass dont see people bitching enjoy game game kinda fun equipment really need able transfer areas hard dungeon group friends got yellow weapon star rarity explore another area weapon stats white weapon star rarity really makes efforts feel like waste exploring harder difficulty areas like dungeon dont seem worth especially going new region completing game like groundhog day trump baby every time cross border back square one endgame items seek find increase exploration abilities oh grinded hours get artifact swimming speed game great egrigeous moment decide move next region following game years closely looking update could find huge chunk things wollay implemented game tweets missing game could beautiful gem suffers poor progression design game like groundhog day trump baby every time cross border back square one endgame items seek find increase exploration abilities oh grinded hours get artifact swimming speed game great egrigeous moment decide move next region following game years closely looking update could find huge chunk things wollay implemented game tweets missing game could beautiful gem suffers poor progression design game perfect anyway however engaging adventure explore also people dont mention fact gearing zone white legendary items fast therefore region lock bad opinioni enjoyed game time spent know might get boring later spending hours game worth every penny price game fun without xp system anymore dont feel like im progression lose stuff new zone everytime game used changed adventure elements added makes game good xp makes game something new clone games grind mobs lvl like game lot like alpha like whole way game worth running simulator trove better option style gamemy advice wait game free continue play game worth playing youve completed first biome game oddly addicting since theres much see maybe kind game lot problems address throughout reviewit promised alpha beta two completely different games bad similarities focus game exploration game make easy soon enter new regions lose mobility gear enemies mostly tough classes unbalanced lot sustain water mage struggle lot survive rogue feel like game gets walking circles thing game changing mechanics change regions quests often repeat dungeons pretty similar mean different regions unique characteristics theyre really something interesting enoughcube world potentil game looks feels unfinished even years development keep looking foward updates plan keep playing game hope change review soon game okay theres least hours content even region locking thingmodding made game lot better already definitely enjoyable worth money p game pretty boring start get becomes whole lot fun go another regionstill fun game good time killer game pretty good like grinding games free roam might hard start gets easier play game game set way foster exploration play get amazing stuff first zone move next basically starting completely overthe system stands far punishing explorer really rewards people visit new place beat death exhaust content moving oni hope changes developer extremely nonresponsive comes features game hes great bugfixes addressing issues like past week anyway zero interaction community aside thatthere many positive things exploring world absolutely awesome except progression system punishes far much wandering far wherever fly across huge sections world interesting zone gear knocked worst quality even difficult kill easiest enemiesif get game play experience system decide whether like people definitely simply notin opinion incredibly disheartening see wonderful gem tarnished shallow progression system hope changes really want gaming community experience unique fun game without feeling like work much game slightly different version yes good everything thought detail fact farm gear maps problem progression slow doesnt bad want everything made easy come forum cry like babiesif ask recommend game yes wollay xd game solid though honestly recommend grabbing mod make progressive leveling game keep entertained hours game still good im waiting skill progression ill happy doesnt seem much improvement alpha though slightly dissapointedi need skill tree game super fun ones get ball rolling soon ball starts rolling quickly stopswhen clear first zone hit wall progress tied zone tied character im trouble finding motivation continue playing first zone clearas game currently cannot recommend game game vastly different released alpha years ago want game turn away want open world voxel adventure game procedural quests cube world game game different alpha think changes great yes things kind frustrating like zone locked items think helps getting feel game creating base level rise overall really enjoy game huge fan alpha thats worth anything game isnt perfect different alpha released back lot alpha players got play beta reacted badly game saying wasnt remember wanted thats isnt game alpha progression revolved around experience levels grinding made feel powerful working hard choices restart new character never challenged thats love new cube world games system region locking resets lot progress go new areathese areas arent small lot fun exploring first zone rolling hills valleys done could felt powerful like alpha able fly land find secrets items collected next region ocean stretching horizon entering didnt feel like losing progress felt like new game could go whole adventure like great sequel im currently sixth region game first character started ive collected artifacts items make start bit better first region enjoy place adventure said game isnt perfect hard find new quests tied people talk sometimes left wandering find regions last locations regions less interesting others well could use unique features also quite features tweeted developer years never made game hope added soonoverall cube world different game alpha old version definitely fun new version stands well enough would recommend anyone looking zeldalike rpg experience try game isnt perfect progression needs reworking starting little difficult daunting isnt much guide tell start things unfortunately lot people seem much nostalgia alpha version week release introduced best friend cube world realized progression system broken curve infinitely generated worlds version drastically changed progression system much untested polished slightly world much interesting shrines life better since act fast travel destinations villages cool theming npcs tell important stuff give quests sure go try asking around dungeons little nicer especially difficulty color coding dungeon maps artifact gear based progression isnt bad thing destiny works fine problem finding good way implement cube world lacking unfortunately much gameplay relies moment drastically shows review tells alpha better consider might affected nostalgia wasi recommend game want see live game improving time much mans sky cannot recommend game current state try update time game lost attractiveness back multiyearlong alpha phase yes prepurchased game somewhen sense progress achievement one got game leveling finding better better items simply destroyed implementation complete reset every time player crosses new zone previously mentioned negatively impact sense longterm achievement also isolates biome one another previously seemed connected crossing border two biomes meant change mobs style etc like pressing start new game button thus world feels incredibly smallwhat furthermore adds sense achievement missing completing zones primary quest goals awards small neglectable stats upgrades doesnt make appealing creates much incentive players keep playingsadly developers isolated approach coding game resulted game seems lost soul possessed early life cycle attracted many people game major mechanic changes introduced cannot recommend spending money game pretty fun play played steam think developers take time access players might like give choice choosing systems something everyone enjoy everything though like cube world thing huge fan newer area switch systems loss power going section mean could simply release plugin disable players like system however need give lower rating since developers get scared handle players go trolling raging changes ever want chat wolffram please feel free hit game different alpha doesnt mean bad game pros cons version game fun bring content constantly genuinely try game hard get used im sure good time game removed progression instead fixing scalling enemies increase playtime exploring new areas joke since lose almost progress lasting buffs artifacts joke game kind plays like roguelike every time enter new area start scratch except get artifacts upgrade character permanently fun start new world try see quickly complete areas quests one games lots different classes worth playing game cycle least every class sometimes even changing weapon huge effect gameplay havent tried multiplayer yet looks promising dont play water mage way makes game waaay easy game lacks genuine content feels empty meaningless quests dont feel rewarding worthwhile ive played game steam release honestly doesnt feel like impressive step game looked cool got swagger souls fitz turned trash game may different people expected however reason say game necessarily bad never assume alpha stages game anything similar end result looks like far goes game certainly needs work especially gpu driven era gaming find way incorporate make run smoother easier worth anything personally enjoy game eventually came know youre progress really fast rpg elements game enhanced lot decent cpu definitely worth trying sort game hey problem right game needs lot work still game currently still lot fun game needs improvement rather review bombing game creating scenario developer feels like lost instead create articulate valid criticism still enjoying whats wollay able rationally develop instead deal internets wraith overreacted something minor like internet always game needs one minor change go completely pointless past first hours worth playing much longer periodcollecting artifacts already generates levels character absolutely bearing anything simply convert level talent point build talent tree basic abilities buffs fix problems people regionlocked progressionlist permanent unlocks key item normally perregion original spawns would replaced item gold drop upgrades key items gliderboatclimbing speed hidden item find radius etc automatic reveals points interest instead manually talking random npcs increased droprate increased item chance items work adjacent zones longer dodge roll double jump etclistthe current progression path hours area youre forced reset zero new area increase abilities matter many areas complete talent tree described would similar experience first couple areas beyond significant speed automation improvements would radically change goals zone fast complete even feeling characterthe game would eventually need manner endgame challenge really utilizes upgrades genuinely isnt necessary till well launch talent tree alone additions content would allow satisfying experience collecting artifacts possibly even repeated across character classes playersa system like blatantly obvious simple implement reason hasnt done stubbornness oddly new progression path implemented months ago years development dev needs get asap drop everything else add talents youll see game tanked reception otherwise game needs serious work progression long term goalsother game still fun hours new questzone system pretty niceif game stays state safe say old version better game needs work overall think pretty solid foundation region locking biggest thing needs go seriously adjusted tutorial would welcome variety better usefulness artifacts different enemy mechanics looking forward seeing game goes coming yearsupdate gave plenty time see update would release hasnt game abandoned dev took money ran changing review thumbs game needs work enjoy main issues high commitment low reward said commitment form search loot every time enter new zone ground im favour new system gear doesnt become redundant outside home region instead falling power levels becoming useless biomes away biome originadditionally think would benefit game bring back xp system instead make focus base stats health attack strength etc artifact system remains place stats currently controls albeit slightly higher reward per artifact finally regards progression difficulty instead white yellow system universal difficulty scale difficulty could perhaps simply increase new region explored player enemies getting overall buffs health damage along player eventually end players reaching health thousands fighting enemies health thousands game lot room improvement still reasonably enjoyable get past growing phase adapting unorthodox game design region locked loot based progression personally cannot wait see else wollay decides add game really good anymore man wollay needs work things want like want recommend game cant things alpha years ago straight removed disappointing say least game right might little bad alpha still better wish didnt restart every time go new location hope developer tries make game like alpha version doesnt ill still play wait mods something believe game least playable dont like grinding game definitely dont play game seems complicated first settled first region youll problem beating next one first theres tutorial kind difficult manage overall fun big world right really awesome much new feature game simply feels empty lot people emphasized questionable design choicesafter get gear game feels like breeze soon leave region boats mounts pretty much uselessthis feels lot like early access game shame game somehow went backwards development since alpha somehow managed spend years development time make game strictly worse buying game like buying scam dont game starts slow move forward fun doesnt stop game still feels lacking like tech demo wouldnt recommend buying big updates game still looks pretty honestly cant see sinking anymore hours beautiful visuals variety choices character creator generic music killing enemies feels pointless despite challenging youll find running circles youre geared everything game doesnt tool tips prompts tell play iti personally felt less way alpha didnt expect release like thiscant recommend sadly game takes sometime good frank still havent reached although give lot cant handle enemieson scale id give great game although quite challenging would dive people away game took every aspect fun xp skill trees ext replaced crap downright punishes trying explore gear useless unless get gear takes lot unfun grinding cases need regions get said good stuff ed even gear ive heard made far yet degrade like gear get far area acquired itgrinding fun ends getting one shot next region whats point theres also relics carry world replaced leveling xp system place oh boy cant wait work region amount increased swimming speed slightly faster gliding speed game worth six years development somehow regressed quality end day still nothing barebones experience cause get enough content see lot repetition game used amazing especially alpha great qualities alpha arent anymore im hoping game continue grow change review basically feels like waste time progression almost non existant machanics work game better years ago really way game better alpha wouldnt mind changes wasnt region lock dont mind skill tree gone entire map showing region lock got game better alpha game fine hours wont load crashes everytime game fun little got repetitive game great huge update came turned shitty game game great alpha exp system hoping brings back game looks great great potentiali sure shape fantastic game better state first released years ago progression grindy extremely repetitive combat cryptic unbalanced hell gear rewards general begin get boring faster rpgs despite focus new system cool aesthetic good amount customization beautiful map system outright good game point tldr wait come early access make decision game much better alpha version unlike full release game actual sense progress procedural world generation progressive increases difficulty got world center cube world really isnt worth getting full price wait sale even make sure really want cause theres pretty good chance youll get bored within hours playtime game fun promising came back super interesting really enjoyed played lot regardless fact wasnt much direction mostly sandbox time thought going go somewhere sadly game took different turn hoped would enemy placement started become odd frequent leading immediately frustrated enemy grouping difficult also lazy looking considering went areas would see ogre would difficult much eventually usually rare drop seeing grouped together along lot sort mini boss enemies grouped large numbers high levels early feel like made every enemy become easy forget compared progression became less character random gear got also biggest fan like gear interesting abilities differences nothing game really sort unique stat go outside damage game like diablo factors like ability improve damage type give dexterity necessary stat things make grinding slight improvements interesting due needing see factors deciding upgrade downgrade cube world doesnt yet focus switched way heavily gear progression themes game dont fit place anymore mention worlds longer randomly generated world eventually repeats way feel also another regression sadly cannot recommend cube world state dont know improved future cant play game pretty shit tried mods still pretty shit less shit guess thats enough still shit tho game buggy friendly new players starting monsters around spawn area stars would one shot also took long time figure get friends location whenever friend joined server joined server would away long time finally figured could use fast travel get game went completely new direction threw everyone actually like change new style progression although artifacts havent changed buffed believe need work would reccomend game anyone everyone standard rpg think botw kinda games regionbased progression bandaid fix deeper issues game longevity balance game whitegreenbluepurpleyellow rarity system player gear enemies enemies one two rarities almost unkillable unless use cheese tactics youre lucky receive weapon drop become pathetically easy rarity tiers raise stats around double makes fights outside gear rarity either easy difficult get yellow weapon enemies region trivializedthis without mentioning stuck one biome leave may well created new character gear made useless goal collect artefacts permanent upgrades give miniscule buffs lamp radius swim speed impossible widescale adventure spanning multiple zones due gear resets done one zone effectively completed game go motions try drops tier recollect basic travel options like boat gliderthe game broken core fundamental systems gear scaling progression stifling ability really explore feel like theres permanence growth gameplay isnt bad really like artistic style game fun friendsthe thing holding back recommending game lackluster leveling region lock current moment feels like large yet shallow lake games good current state gear system little weird like game overall goal game bland real main story game driven exploration survival features believe adding story line andor main bosses greatly improve game top basic leveling system improves stats character granddaddy hyped eagerly waited games absolutely worth waitwollay proud hes createdvery accessible content sense discovery littered every corner gamethe game rewarding keep getting better class picked punish use safer strategies play gamebecause open world game wrong way play wanna cheese high level boss go aheadthe open endedness way wraps together creates unique experience best explained trying yourselfive loved since start love see game evolveit sparks feeling ive felt last time decade ago feeling got first played awesome games like ratchet clank crash bandicoot kingdom hearts spyro dragon missed feeling much love play cube world spark feeling every time fire upthanks wollay never repay amount joy brings please leave comment common occurance id love hear hour half put well worth year wait fun lot funnier playing friends would also want see game get updates keep fresh lack meaningful progression via artifact system resetting gear strength regions doesnt appeal ive tried enjoy game give new systems chance isnt something enjoyfor isnt enough justify purchase right hadnt backed alpha many years ago wouldnt even consider buying latest update like hitler even hitler cared germany something leveling system changed still much fun color codes stars enemies heads makes soooo much easier fight truly fun game worthwhile main draw cube world much encourages exploration unlike procedurally generated open world games end bolted one part map biomes varied set buildings dungeons fauna even nothing interest around environment sufficethe core gameplay solid combat fluid satisfying classes feels unique adding good amount strategy playing group good way freshen game using one class long time inbetween large variety ways travel drowning tedium getting around quests however tend samey kill albeit different reasonthe progression cube world turns lot people power tied gear gear tied region well almost rare gear passed closeby regions give leg artifacts follow everywhere provide small exploration based buffs personally see testing new concept way solve problem infinite world tied character finite goal mindoverall great game coupled confusing experimental system cube world would highly benefited tutorial explains systems allows earn basic gear get starting difficultly still worth playing even youre thrilled region locking definitely get moneys worth even clear regions trying new class setting game playtime time read review recommend new mechanics pretty fun enjoy running around friends beating monsters shame people went positive negative thoughts span like day really wish people might see try compare much alpha though probably never happen since people make mind internet refuse change new progression pretty wack look review explanation core game still really fun honestly wollay gives game quick update allow people keep gear changes artifacts impactful main issue mostly solved also make base run speed faster allow us fast travel previously found area interest instead shrines leave positive review want people experience least first main area game want wollay keep working calling wollay lazy scammer doesnt help anybody let wollay hear fair criticism lets let man iron problems kill remember even month ago fate game unknown time writing less week since release trust least new year current issues worked better solid game hands please buy cube world least worth asking price new region based system really bad reason buy craft good gear basically lose soon completed region lot good things earlier versions removed teased features implemented feels like huge downgrade new region lock game progression system kind killed fun game hopefully theres way patch feature game lot fun back alpha new system different honestly like better back alpha game grindfest kill monsters level really whole game release actual game zone exists isolation next isnt bad thing uevery new region supposed treated entirely new gameu gear find artifacts arent supposed huge effect definitely recommend multiplayer easy pickup play hoursi miss old ocean biomes though og cube world better think updates good old cube world better old leveling system alpha stripped steam version gear get region locked even years ago game almost perfect could released steam one would complainedthe thing could done time add alpha update classic mode game developer stuck new system hundreds hours alpha ran server current steam version appeal meuntil version mechanics get changed back old way cannot recommend game current state ole bait switchthis good walking sim good thing game realize exciting watching paint dry real issues game adding overwatchish skills left click right click place multiple skills region locking things like hanggliders saddles fact gear becomes useless every time enter new regioneverything else pretty great quests dungeons multiplayer love wish didnt change things werent problem original cube world alpha excellent game fun gameplay great potential majority negative reviews like game changed drastically changed directionscube world beta completely reworked progression system gear resets regions activities within region less previous region makes rather repetitive gameplay loop one enjoy everyone believe get moneys worth game aware youre purchasing set expectations accordingly original alpha back much potential rewarded explorationthe progression fun brokenthe towns variety purposethe world interesting resources fairly easy come byfast forward thing stayed broken progression system rest turned something much worsei really wanted get back game much love hope years ago years development gave us unsalvageable mess original cube world fun loved playing watching cube world game cube world graphics abilities completely new loved old system monsters scaled always better gear forcing reset every new zone deal breaker overall gameplay elements good region locking makes really difficult play much relics earn dont anything useful never buff main stats overall id give game current state people mad game obviously havent played enough figure progress game extremely fun get party together take new region fantastic game perfect example careful wish possitivesthis game ton potential stands right unfinnished product game starts without giving guidance ever theres use speaking npcs since wont explain anything anywayonce youve figured get started however pretty enjoyable progressing isnt badthe negativesbut dont dare think exploring walk new area lose progress exception pets pet foods potionsfoods minor movement stats completely unrelated combat map completely uncovered therefore gives excitement exploring new landsnot mention theres xp skill tree fill feeling progression theres progression meter show much area youve completedon top creator egocentric wont take critique community form feedback would require change wont reply anyone anything game paranoid hire team assist work mention completely left ignored alpha community six whole yearsas much want game good right really baddont spend money save cash time presteam version still better progression completely destroyed rpg never gain sense power control world within game progression system alpha much better removing character leveling skill tree system big mistake system replaces annoying character progression stats based items find loose access items leave region found every time go exploring main point game restart square one despite great additions game like new buildings enemies fast travel progression system killed funif could level character unlock skills like alpha game would blast especially multiplayer im finding enjoyable sad waited years release hope developer changes back progression system nonexistent gear region locked unless get rare drop case doesnt reset cross neighboring regions incentive explore beautiful world one strong points game leveling nonfactor levels determined artifacts collect around world give tiniest boost single non combat stat time ultimately leads zero overall progression endgame content players share seed every region repetitive activities combat pointless exp skill tree gone gear may get random drop becomes pointless second leave region gear upgrades alpha also gone crafting recipes transportationexploration gear things artifacts effect also region locked need unlocked upon entering new region incentive keep playing beat region current state arguably less alpha cant recommend progression system motivating enough enough content years developmentafter first regions youve seen everything progression system sadly terrible hope gets changed game would pretty ok better system progression system might everyones liking game definitely doesnt hold hand random world truly beautiful intriguing spots location locked progression makes zone like separate game little bonuses carry almost like rogue like figure get past wall start really enjoy time find quite unique would definitely recommend prospect official response wollay exiting entire game reason reviews mixed right alpha players liked game easier dont like region locking make cant progress extremely fast finishing one region getting strong enough fight anything wollay removed level scaling enemies game would boring fast kept way though skill tree sad loss also hoping specializations classes like mage elements different warrior skill trees skill tree removed cant happen mods would nice pretty much entirely different game alpha thats expected long time since release alpha enjoyed alpha full release new experience hoping honestly got sick old leveling system whole power thing think game would get really good played long enough found cool things make interesting cheesing boss get good gear finish region ups downs still great game would recommend buying arent pumped wait sale recent update unfortunately missed mark loved alpha purchased years ago complete radio silence years far know ever since update came doesnt help either game promise saw potential game past still remain hopeful future futurefor cant recommend buying game still state region locking mechanics relic hunt gets old quick region lock annoying would recommend dont know spent hours getting good eq nothing get alpha made mobs harder made sense idk theory thing reality wrong feels like ive achieved region nothing pointless pisses love game come g hope u dont limbo another addressing little thing literally one thing atleast long u keep playing one region fun hell main fun seeing new bosses new places region lock makes difficult explore lack levels makes grinding fun enemies fighti still remember alpha cube world tons fun friends nownot anymore play mod comes changes old playstyle region locking sucks coop decent total playtime game hours finished first area got bored start increase climbing speed increases base stats ie attack hp mp resistance armour exploration stats option adding meaningful stats well random exploration stats waited years inferior product alpha might get better willing change review im holding breath another years removal transport items boat glider reign pet every region border hurts even last remaining progression system left game speed boosts items artifactsthe lack meaningful communication wollay pixxie another issue bad cant recommend steam release downgrade loved back day cube world pretty sad thing cube world game doesnt progression thing game progression items really hard find takes hours get artifact boosts get artifacts arent worth time effort think process like fun interesting play style sort scaling system towards game example get first artifact double click artifact stats get boosted next region enemies would little harder play way get stronger stronger progress regions fun similar system implemented game highly suggest dont buy game current state thing think game good ideas could become good interesting gamebut current moment huge step beta lacking actual good fucking gameplay best thing could happen every poor soul bought piece crap game get refund update great know critical gonna drive wollay away community years im sorry update bad originally cube world awesome game heavy focus exploration beta dev gutted way progression worked xp levels skill tree replaced new system find gear gear determines level whenever leave current biome gear found biome disabled start completely actively discourages exploring instead forcing spend hours biome complete moving change opinion made game completely unenjoyable play way game built makes little difference hour character hour character respect time spends hours getting gear opening exciting chests ripped away due horrible disrespectful progression system literally trys motivate continue playing punishing playing sorry thats fair get movement speed increase completing zone thing seconds faster yay shaved seconds hour zone clearing time totally worth lets throw away gear customization square onei played even half finished alpha many hours far better wollay redeemable feature first play though first zoneyour money better spent elsewhere unless fixes trash progression system way progress crap legendary items didnt want start quit whole purpose legendary item extremely difficult obtain obtain well keep journey instead get almost free get taste overpowered want explore instatly became level thug like mafia publicity trailers make artifacts affect stats runningclimbing swimming want keep item bound system dont make legendaries easy zone make hard get permament item doesnt change dont discourage people exploringinstead region locking make region base level way know going level gear travel something else dont reset progress players world generation awesome areas look feel unique dont get boring dungeon generation great keeps one feeling fresh even youve seen main structure world absolutely feels alive friendly animals enemies roaming npcs thing lot different regional biomes one looks totally different changes way get around welltraversing world fantastic class different mobility options like sprinting teleporting dashing hanggliding never fun especially great views see climbing free climb surface long enough stamina obtain item help swimming boats lakes rivers oceans mount pet even running speed many respawn points unlock also serve fast travel points flight master towns let quickly reach friends pay visit undiscovered areasthe way game works world broken many regions completing one area several hours moving onto next gears power carrying means reentering core loop starting fresh gaining power time complete quests fight enemies close overall power level sense game feels like roguelite complete main game start albeit brand new world generation biome also gain permanent power form artifacts minor noncombat stat boosts coins crafting materials occasional gear gear retains power nearby regions keeps game stagnating youve finished initial power curve region actually feel like new challenge get experience satisfying power curve however system may sit well every player enjoy starting find frustrated whenever must move new regiontalking npcs towns throughout world reveal whats going region showing quests difficulty completing quests get better gear unlock things world better items shops higher level crafting getting rid roadblocks lot quests long procedurally generated dungeons tons enemies big boss permanent rewardunfortunately artifacts act permanent upgrades unreasonably minor swimming speed acceptable reward hours playtime idea great actual upgrades need better though hopefully sort improvement otherwise looking modders fix systemcombat bit depth originally gave credit class subclass plays combat differently different abilities weapons strategies different weapon types change main alternate attack methods go many throughout region core combat dealing damage stunning empowered attack deal damage time heal craft elixirs give stat boosts struggling enemies vary attacks ranged telegraphed charge abilities dash etc humanoid enemies classes difficulty way playing melee classes easy deal mages absolute nightmare rollingdodging avoid certain attacks combat falls flat definitely core enemy ai enemies run straight line hit range use attack makes kiting important stronger enemies fast faster however feels bit lame real depth also many large bosses sponges huge health pools slowly whittle tamecollect pets pet food find randomly scale dont need micromanagement used mounts tank damagedeal damage battles much say besides collecting fun completionist task matching gamemany systems game set cooperative gameplay succeed ive got say coop pretty well done want play friend invite join instantly together world absolutely loading games may make new character play friend starting game dont enter new region start level playing field reach friend need go town flight master bring youre done playing coop go back region working feels great biggest problems coop following team hud meaning difficult see players health problem especially healers also difficult times tell another player died quest markers shared dont talk npcs may missing quest markers isnt huge deal annoying planning go next regardless good game coopthe graphics good stylized simple works fancy shaders metals gold pleasing look map system great pleasure browse also runs incredibly well compared games smooth visible chunk loading ala minecraft environment beautiful unfortunately always consistent effects jarring ugly playing mage means staring ugly block tornado using basic attack seeing time bombs explode one disappointing ways ever seen gamethe audio probably least favorite part game like sound effects many combat sounds feel impactful footsteps loud unpleasant going water feels like left faucet running music better several tracks sound like old midi files fortunately lot songs good lot many different situations biomes said audio game easily moddable replace wavogg files redeemed aspect mewollay good communication difficult tell future holds cube world lot things love lot things dont think belong hopes developers modders address things potential game insane properly supported see playing years game passion project two people make game want even majority players may wantin conclusion game everyone enjoy design one best exploration games world completely ready forgive wollay years radio silence seemed like took money ran longest time original game simple easy hop good time new version puzzle figure completely devoid feeling progression satisfaction honestly tacked couple bits extra content alpha years ago people wouldve eaten enjoyed instead somehow managed spend years making game much less enjoyable back astounding lack judgement release state knowing much meant peopletheres excuse id say dont refund yet wait update fix dont another years patience left lot people giving game bad review things significantly changed alpha build released years ago id like give bit different perspectivei also played love alpha trying new version definitely jarring played long enough learn new mechanics got settled back found game still fun probably still better alphapretty much negative reviews revolve around xp changes people dont like rather miss simplified gain xp level mechanics see games power version changed levels gearing also revolves around regions meaning power doesnt transfer regions accomplishes things primarily longer way outscale even strongest enemies possible certain point alpha concrete system replayability moving new regions completed one currently change actually makes game lot fun least dont looming sense game becoming triviali think people really giving game fair due hope people like game originally least give shot still really like aspects game love stands cant recommend cube world become painful experience playcube world best youre moving around quickly exploring new areas findingfighting new things currently decent enough albeit slow dont find mobility items youre one zone quickly turns awful go new zoneprosgreat music combat still decent class imbalance still totally thing classes feel similar alpha couple added abilities thats nice added bits lore neat nice see quests treasure neat new things wildconsclass balance isnt great especially subclasses friends found frustratingstatic world definitely think game better changeable world seed rather static worldoh boy go back alpha wed go really long glider trips zones looking unique different zones explore ones right us seemed uninteresting repetitive regionlocked gear along regionlocked mobility items makes less impossibleregion locked gear every time leave zone gear youve received immediately reduced absolute trash grey standard rpg rarity colours apply stats unless piece gear keeps power within certain set zones time mostly clearing one zone managed get single piece gear really really bad implementation imo gear dropped rarities default radius zones got region locking wouldnt nearly horrifying situation new zone gear makes absolutely useless regionlocked mobility items boat glider mount reins climbing shoes region locked group found climbing shoes us pretty thorough exploring whole zone play time single zone didnt find boatglider cube world needs gliderboat zones theres absolute ton walking otherwise cant reliably find hints absolute key items top moment leave zone items stop working game thrives exploration absolutely harshly punishes single handedly worst part game even painful regionlocked gear utility items harp whistle treasure spirit etc vanish zone isnt big deal issue like losing gear mobility isthe progression carries regions artifacts artifacts give small boosts secondary stats lantern aoe glider speed underwater breathing time etc suffer diminishing returns nothing really makes powerful makes things less hasslesome bugs etc gameplay obvious class bugs stability issues feels like game maybe barely tested patches coming huge issuein conclusion cant recommend game modern state mechanics arent less fun alpha genuinely think create ultimately frustrating unenjoyable experience alpha access go back play instead want everything addedchanged beta reverted core components definitely need either removed heavily revamped make game enjoyable punishing players continuing play isnt really great move many aspects cube world absolutely love gorgeous world generation landscapes awesome character modelsdifferent races unique enemiesbosses list goes spent many enjoyable hours playing alpha edition game looked forward next game far beta looks runs well primary reason negative review change alpha beta change complete removal xp level system character enemies items regions skill trees etc could maybe get past sort real combat based character progression lack implementation region locked items upon entering new biomeregion lose statslose item gear boats hang gliders etc exception items allow use items extra regions ultimately becoming useless travelling far distances new lands believe game still potential really think wollay pixie done fantastic job creating world however someone enjoyed old progression system excited footage posted showing levels item levels enemy levels region levels etc suggestion would keep current beta mechanics type quickplay mode would fun short sessions friends reimplement old mechanics character level skill trees enemy levels item levels varying rarity region levels get higher travel etc etc etc rpg mode many others would much rather play latter mechanics willing change review positive something like implemented many fundamental issues games design philosophy modders already attempting fix itwould recommend buying game state absolutely notwill say game real future potentially due way developer made game everyone loved something completely different without listening feedback community created reason believe developer listen feedback whatsoeverits sad games alpha inspired many games finally release one mediocre games marketit things right beautiful game bogged stupid decisions made development could bit progression mix gameplay gear huntstill fun game though lot irritation dislike cube world ever since beta released played beta week put around hours playing far game flaws creator wollay amazing game potential great even thoroughly enjoying feel free explore want play right win battle want even underpowered gear game presents really nice challenge much reason play game leave area everything lost gear reset nothing artifacts get area give small miniscule bonuses help basically nothing would buy game great game hidden inside cube world progress since beta years back great also made steps back honestly much love cube world little hate cant get behind wollay treated community dont think anyone deserves level hate anger hes getting understand coming game something special huge potential wollay abandoned fans years treating us like annoying pests getting way project never wanted deal public could never released game responsibility listen engage community game strayed wildly course nothing like promised region locked gear terrible idea exploration game wollay would never made mistake listening fans instead running away form years cube world community deserve better theres nothing justify making us wait half decade really hope game saved improved time like mans sky really really want love main story real system progression may equip character armor weapons effective region acquired requires craft find new equipment region explore may also find transportation form hang gliders boats reins pet however also usable region found form progression present game artifacts provide bonus small noticeable entering new region similar restarting game new character neutral option steam could review wouldcube world great example never giving hope six years come back sun light sadly kinda wish stayed shadowsif like minecraft lego worlds young child would recommend picking sure wait go sell like engrossing story interesting characters complex toon builds choices truly matter recommend looking else point anything cube worldyou dont get anything killing mobs dont motivation kill mobs dont kill mobs motivation farm good gear without need good gear motivation explore places could find good gearcube world markets exploration rpg really want explore world picking ranger class sneaking world undetectedmonsters gear become completely obsolete isnt greatthe game chooses progression via gear progression via experience completely fine way implemented doesnt make sense chooses restrict scaling player instead scaling game around player sounds great multiplayer join friends regardless playtime takes away every aspect reward systemi absolutely loved concept alpha would still love current game concept sadly isnt system doesnt feel like part complete game potential fun yet isnt much good game seems six years less content hopefully fixed flaws seem fundamental dont much hope reason scratch good things alpha things shown tweets today game currently completely unbalanced lacks clear objective lore seems thought day quests repetitive since region forces reward get back game took changed region feels like punishment happened absolute worst theres zero contact whatsoever developer community seems like hes blatantly ignoring playerbase feels insulting theres lot fun exploring cube world fighting collecting pet taming havent even scratched multiplayer yet blastso far definite issues need ironed many extremely online people mentioning feel region locking mechanic novel idea scaling game order make multiplayer fun scaling usually employed games order keep players power levels close together ways amount damage done scaled game based level scale equipment alone without making numbers neigh meaningless definite task think interesting way solve problem novel idea things need taken consideration dont feel fully considered aside would still heartily recommend cube world anyone keep good work wollay pixxie theres lot love core systems flawed ton potential hope game gets fixed future theres mod released least lets keep gear going neighboring zones maybe im blinded nostalgia ive ton fun playing think hate big overblown band wagon didnt deal zone problem everyone love way classes reworked combat fluid fun things actually new strategies emergent gameplay mage especially far fav well warrior check gamersworth moral reasons alone bought got alpha pirate jokes website theres leveling system game grinding supplies even attempt upgrade stuff slow slow slow slow concept game great execution horrible fix might play wont touching game theres point playing game anymorethis game exploring map getting better loot getting powerful time however features contributed alpha removedas said point game exploring map game punishes exploring removing progress making items either weakened flatout removed inventory go far end switching regions skill tree levels system also removed taking away fun gameive played games alpha hundreds hours still played open mind really wish game good tried convincing good game isnt fact developer vanished game released isnt giving players hopes might fix things theres much say hasnt already said ad nauseumthe game good foundation needs lot work core gameplay changed completely made fun years ago alpha launched website game many features listed come like guilds advanced skill tree pets could evolve none version theres stuff alpha straight removedcoupling disappointing gameplay experience feels like never ending repetitive loop nothing ever changes combat exploration otherwise bewildering progression system takes away gear score soon enter new zone isnt worst thing world artifacts hunt increase levels dont really provide enough reward continue searching oh yeah transportation items disappear enter new region find punishes exploring outside regionthere used diving water creatures dungeons ocean thats removed used dungeons general alpha far fewer nowand way game managed years always felt like wollay developer took money ran didnt communicate happening game course years hed post twitter little bit progress showed really neat things working little work made gameso like base game feel like idea could expanded ultimately still feels like base early access game years really things changed fundamental gameplay design nothing really feels like added stuff feels like taken away ultimately things different newi criticize game would like succeed watching game years first played years ago feeling much changeit isnt worth current state things change review edited reflect simply worth hope game develops thing promised years ago cannot review game might become review game theres really progression game fun play get items back region gets boring especially since hang glider boat reins region locked exploration takes lot longer enter new region gameplay pretty fun combat feels good enemies wizards balanced fun fight world big interesting explore ability customize weapons great changes could become even fun alpha enjoyed much years ago theres nothing inside wide game boring lacking much potential promised shown got hope ups game future theres nothing substance six years development even small team real mystery thinking given cube world gives little work start may well development process reflected gameplay meagre offerings start finishaesthetically game looks theres new mobs items isnt six years worth work anything game play regressed rewarding dont mind challenge figure mechanics experimentation isnt itid recommend avoiding hopefully theres gameplay overhaul future changed game simply worth spending time like quests redo reseting character traveling game levels aritifacts skill tree actually quite fun im saying artifacts bad invention retained levels aswell also usual quests biome becomes repetetive point never wanting play hopes game liked come back better wolfram deleted features fun releasing steam alpha great version frustrating boring robocraft built awesome game got giant community removed community loved replaced random things one wantsthis game got years ago essentially made roguelike without charm gameplay one gameplay loop frustrating doesnt give real benefits biggest contention game sink hours game meaningful difference someone hours skill trees permanent rewards second go new zone gone wanted game good bad added game steam cut contentonly buy like current state game since cant expect updatesyou get free steam key already bought alpha website earlierseems like also feedback devs anything stupid nobody knows even working game removed features like leveling skills really hard get anywhere without getting oneshotted removed good features replaced worse ones launching game steamit might fun hours friends dont recommend getting removed explevels used artefacts everytime get new zone everything got far restartgrinding useless everything gives coins put game non recommended decided play anywayi wanted understand creator used version rather worked beforeandi ended finding enjoying iti must say rpg version game extremely fun lost oncebut pretty good well

everyone everyone map spawns different area loops back infinite maplosing progression everytime cross borderlosing boat glider saddle every time cross border every hour solosing gear every time cross border every hour sothe point game get artifacts artifacts increase swim speed lamp light radius gets diminished artifact obtained meansyou need artifacts max every exploration stat useless stats like swimming speed latern ligh radius increase need year get everything maxedwhich game gets repetitve hour buy game really downgrade alpha version game letdown previous version nonetheless still great fun game game ive waited ever worth wait awesome game looks great game years hiding darkness given whole new light graciously brought us wollay pixxie games changes served better expectation things could use touching much play beta far found fun every corner rate voxel adventure rpg game stars complaint would current biome ocean biome definetly changed alpha versions able cruise within minutes makes kinda boring time recommend sort underwater temple would require player get stamina usage diving artifacts introduction underwater breathing potions anything general would make ocean biome feel oceany island resort least bring back underwater monsters mean ones would spawn underwater blowfish land overall game earned right called great anticipated game game exploration fundamental least like alphanow brand new progression system kills good feelings first region nice funny second one bit boring get everything third one play gone gliderthis total failurelucky still alpha installed amazing game played around years beta alpha idk im back playing amazing love new updates keep work feels like really solid early access title since doesnt claim early access im worried game ever going game absolutely flaws give game negative review would outright wrong beta introduces new style gameplay suited everyone personally lot fun alpha would get endgame would peaked keep one shotting enemies soft reset region going stage progression time dont see punishment exploring granted artifacts seek region need kind revamp even fun hopefully thats something future game alpha two different games personally liked alphas gameplay mechanics willing give try first areas quite entertaining gameplay doesnt much longevity didnt motivation basically start scratch every areagot game release date even weeks later coopmultiplayer unplayable maybe someday ill give chance see anythings changed cant recommend buying game current state definitely full price disappointing long development time promising alpha game brings sadness sad please help buy game game changed dramatically since released didnt feel like better id continue waiting game could good kept beta puts world instructions everything way stronger hard progress barley find new good weapons theres nothing explore game couldve good really hope fix game would rate game definitely shown lot potential far little exposed core game polished gameplay mechanics integrated hit miss im going list artifacts lack skill tree slow progression since reviewers going go way indepth sunk couple hours learn game try enjoy current state cannot im still going follow though hope updates help game unlock potential im giving negative review may change timehopefully wollay compromise satisfying community intentions game game hold hand early game super rough first starting xp system feel fits super odd rpg got maxed hours used gear tranfers connecting lands max another biome able snow ball would kill game explore depend villages adventures map knowledge buffs biome grindy forces explorization game lot promise alpha practically abandonware developer cut run game twice back would happy game removed steam frankly modders people keeping game alive working thanks game alot love put simple change wasnt communicated addressed fanbase ruined many peopledo buy let developer learn lesson communication key move game still much potential got excited started playing cube world early alpha days years ago hearing making reappearance got excited game againhowever content game progressed huge amount given time new content exists hard enjoy due changes gameplay constant hard reset areas incredibly slow rate finding even weak items carry areas discourages exploration takes lot fun awaythe new content older gameplay mechanics would make game much enjoyablein current state dont think game worth purchase gets updated things change could well become worth itbut hey thats opinion game massive potential turned mobile game heres game beautiful environments feed itch explore heres issue game infinite procedural generation punishes exploration making restart progress character mobilityspecial items gear name thing doesnt reset artifacts gain like mobile game system could valid valid issue lies fact artifacts simply give useless stat increases like swim speed run speed lantern brightness real sense progression area easily take hours complete quests bland travel boring forced walk hang glider special item crossed border new region interesting issue multiplayer well start complete opposite side world partner isnt issue go town use hawk quick travel friend issue gear useless yes starting gear useless another starter zone couldnt damage enemies even white named easiest enemies real fun friend used cheat engine increase fire rate even shooting arrows speed minimal damage get game unless done research agree current system place maybe even wait see anything changes im counting modding community make betaalpha combination alpha mechanics betas new worlds game much potential still good game mods mods tho game potential two developers working could apparently take advantage years developement thousand copies sold would hire anyone help money got game worst main developer teasing lot content game twitter years releasing beta steam none added final build another thing note made announcement explain anything related game even censored people critizing game steam forums bbefore buying game read rest review check recents videos people playing game videos alpha bso lets talk gamelist unlike rpgs dont get anything except gold sometimes stuff killing mobs dont skill trees either level finding artifacts hidden region leveling doesnt get great benefits except shinier lamp faster glidingswimming speed parts world divided regions time move another region stuff nerfed useless new region meaning refind better stuff region since artifacts doesnt get stat boost attackdefense things like almost starting new character gear loot randomly game permanent either become useless like normal gear regions apart gear nerfed stuff like hangglider boats reigns ride pet disappear crossing region find new region get back go back region found friend group system place make multiplayer friendly loot personnal get damage lore poor uninteresting quests consists killing mobs classes op ie fire mage kill every enemy melee class damage abusive glitch like flying dedicated servers must everyone friend list want play npcs quests easy find since anything head anything else distinguish spawnrate natural ressources used crafting materials poor mods support none plannedlisti could go game im disappointed even continue talking even indie developpers excuses game skeleton game years development moreover sold game people advertised features never came web archive game page url could taken time develop ask advice community feels like wanted make cashgrab game would proud still sure want buy game go see recent videos lookup alpha videos since game changed lot made mind game much potential creators took everyones money long ago delivered something way worse years later total crap nothing like initially promised worse game years ago dont recommend giving dime money game much potential back beta stage however current state recommend level means nothing sure level system even exists point items find one area cant take use another area makes exploring past leveled pointless go play trove free much better place game must play something similar game much potential original alpha fun open world sandbox rpg version game wasnt well received original still potential great abandoned instantly released steam im always saddened see game library wish dev still worked really fleshed cube world heart gone forgotten game high potential alpha fun well thought game dev disappeared high potential game lost excited game finally get released high potential game money grabber region lock restricting hours put one region irritating different artifacts find barely even boost bosses easy hard game couldnt balance anything honestly majorly disappointed years waiting fantastic alpha evolve something great wasted dev never gave game care love deserves wasted potentialtldrthe dev gave game thought believe created free money game potential fell flat fun first hours gameplay realize nothing left area decide go neighboring region find gear useless items like hang glider boat locked another region start get completing region tiny upgrade stats dont much help game really wish developer would added game better progressionleveling system game feels rewarding resetting items little satisfactionedit playing game mods makes whole lot better plan buying game recommend getting mods let use gear across multiple borders make enemy scaling thing game fine base alpha alot fun new version really clear goal wonder play hour half friend really didnt get anywhere killed alot enemies quests thing show sword got alot gold coins couldnt spendi want game good fun play region locked equipment real progression wondering gets boring really quickly especially everyone deals much damage way much damage game ok right could much better really needs work done certain areas game lot great potential combat system great loot system great dungeons great also like animals creatures turn flattened pixels killed dont like armor weapons region land locked move another area armor weapon effect lands like get purple bow damage one land damage xp system tells far close leveling game unlimited exploration creatures fight fun game play got right gear dying fast still play game wallay doesnt get rid region land lock armor weapons hoping changes future game lot potential still fun needs major fixes fix lag way fun friends lag needs kind trading system ai little buggy running circles targeting playersi hope helpful hope fixes would considered game lot potential potential put game remain dull task playi purchased game half decade ago feels almost nothing substantial added changed good anything theyve added mystery meeverything one shots little help even story line objective ive playing hours recently boring really really hope make fantastic game im sure could goo last years doubtfuli would love able recommend game currently cannot game lot potential needs lot workbring back actual leveling relics dont even help lose youre weapons zones boats para gliders go away going zones weapons equipment downgrade selfs zoning overall harder get good gear shouldnt scale feel like actual progression rather felling like zone go go back overall enjoying playing game friends point driving force make want play future game steep learning curve need come like region roguelike carryover perks complete region leaving frombut extremely difficult started really enjoying game style design things would like change complain still fun playing since alpha looking forward friends playing feel team make game easier altogether enjoyablewallay know long hard road congratulations getting release let people appreciate work take away ignore people complain everyone opinions trolls game ways go id recommend buying proper review fashion im gonna give pros cons give final verdictpros game fun multiplayer ive thoroughly enjoyed playing friends moments pretty frustrating overall enjoyable experience combat engaging playing pretty much class decimating enemies hours region fun world gen good ive run one major issue hill blocking treasure another hill respawn points relatively common game isnt buggy issues nothing totally game breakingconsregion locking gear items get region artifacts rare gear locked region get wouldnt much issue artifacts offered useful effects stands artifacts offer noncombat buffs many argue overall pointless top region locking messing gear resets equipment hang glider boat every time requiring gather every time go new area sense crossregion progression unless value swim speed multiplayer lag host youll experience latency enemy ai go location arent anymore player latency much extreme inhibiting ability properly fight even good connection enemies overpowered imagine youve spent hours working towards best gear get area get decimated mage full tier lower balance something much needs workthe final verdict id recommend remember cube world want play friends dont recommend singleplayer additionally decide buy dont go expecting alpha better thats game wouldnt really recommend game developer fixes major issues community game adventure surprises much new player discover old version game really didnt much offer walk around level fight new bosses get items pets explore new biomes beta version much time admit much harder older version thats makes game entertaining even though might concept still new things try new biomes new enemies new loot collect mega update cube world like done game keep good work game beautiful visuals fun game sit friends explore world game part life since reason computer first placethe games core really fun charming held back new progression systemin opinion xp mobkilling needs brought back otherwise completely pointless kill mobs artifacts also need buffed right theyre really useless enough incentive keep reseting moving zone zone hope funck tweeks progression system near future hope game eventually universally praised masterpiece game able preserve old sense playing whole new adventure embark upon game makeing years believe grade found game looked kickass problem couldnt buy waited waited finally play years waiting totaly worth game well put together even thought im writing ill played hours hours got totaly engaged anyone reads review gather nice game good graphics fantastic world fantasy beauty totaly buy one thing im gonna say want hang glider dont know get one please help ive fallen death please game come long way almost died update mod removes region lock garbage wayyyy fun overall elements still removal skill tree kinda lame imo sure wouldnt mind added another update someone found way mod game evolved lot since alpha although lot negative reviews people dont like new changes takes hours getting used cube world certainly worth wait im glad got early book game evolved since alpha progression good concept needs abit fine tuningquests need variety requires main questall recommend start till end somegive game time appreciate considering team two people game fallen alpha best part mid childhood cant look game like almost downgrade alpha dont buy fond memories reason devs needs reconsider everything theyve done game last years dont know make many bad choices basic things game given new life rpgs excited happy play rpg isnt based mindless cp grinding progress ruined many games people play together game allows friend jump world caught minutesnot days feel good challenging game cant handle something new world warcraft years old still head game people want evolve gaming world thanks putting solid game together game great ideas implemented wrong paper region locking sounds good couple means transport randomness enemies open logic means level upno cohesion mechanics makes game fungame isnt fun anymore game incredible potential however seeing creator gone completely awol us pretty much abandoned game worth youre one people enjoying grinding lose progress grind youll repeat throughout entire gameplay fyi go ahead buy preferably sale first hours gameplay youll blast youll cussing balls game make wait long im really happy play game nice little details thats everything game region lock system poor attempt making game last longer fails miserably theres little nothing map dungeons way level fortunately already mods remove shit parts add good parts taken away go check cube world reddit even game boringat best worth bucks game form meaningful progression whatsoever nothing pushing forward absolutely nothing making want progress past first region even mentioning bizarre design choices region lock gear progression dont buy game worth time current state game none charm alpha basically wandering around biome gear acquire artifact rinse repeat levelling rng dependant even end getting great stuff different class many frustrations recommend game potential hope one day change review positive one biggest thing game lacks progression never feel like youre really gaining anything combat somehow feels less polished alpha came years ago chore gain new gear time bosses take forever kill drop gear another class game went grinding enemies exp grinding armor pieces didnt really add anything far tell beta removes farm adds makes one ponder much game actually worked years keep eye game dont buy yet hopefully wollay listen criticisms make game vast majority love game problems still worth look years ago still fun ride non less game much potential mechanics yet ultimately falls short execution mechanics ultimately feeling odds game feels like precipice greatness yet yetmaybe one day game could reach precipice either update modding stands completely board current state game would recommend giving pass maybe checking back time game much potential really seems like every chance gets game waste players time progression sluggish unrewarding good amount enjoyability game comes hoping procedurally generated world blesses interesting dungeon encounter player little agency experience grand open sandbox adventure railroads along stripping progress every zoneoverall experience fun enjoyed friends think updates changes progression system reworking artifacts increase stats increase base stats like hp attack instead exploration stats like glide boat speed stats become useless exploring new zones lose items upon entering new zone game would absolute blastid recommend keeping eye game watch someone else play seems like speed definitely give chance wont lie fairly disappointed still commend wollay pixxie hard work theyve put crafting product clearly love passionate hopefully game updated way personally find enjoyable ill likely enjoying something else doesnt mean though definitely encourage reading reviews people positive experience game making decision buy game played young lade hours pumped say probloms leveling system still fun still enjoy game fixes leveleing system get better game lot fun played alpha things id keep like skill lineup things im glad different like substantial single player experience great playing game complete downgrade alpha many features removed replaced nothing crafting almost useless level skills either game feel like complete downgrade alpha much potential game disaster hope gets better yet still like rages game disaster years many tweets teasing us amazing content scrapped everything ruined progression killed game going back alpha least progress version game fun voxel game would recommend people play hard first keep going learn use combat system better matter class youll fine game good one isnt people expecting changed simple action rpg action adventure gamecube world one chill game ive played world feels great alive exploring fun journey discover every point interest feels great kinda immersive old school way talk npcs mark map objectives go explore games days feels like breath fresh airthat said game isnt everyone progression zone based turns type roguelike adventure gear collectibles resets zone bad thing didnt bothered getting gear pretty easy midtier gear exploring pretty easily without dying muchalso play alone friends zone based gear great go friends zone dont legendary gear got alone cant boost shit friend wish way around boos friend fun game exploration wandering world searching new artifactscombat feels great easy punishing enough youll die lot leaving dark souls feelings thats good thing honest opinionthe lack class progression thing really bothered rpg skill tree would great giving depth classes character could isnt focus game anymore seemsin conclusion game lot personality really well developed runs great works nicely looks amazing everyone punishing hell yes things worked still great chill game pass time friends nice price
