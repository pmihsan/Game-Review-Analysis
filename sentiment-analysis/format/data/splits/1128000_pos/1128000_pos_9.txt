reins lantern etc opposed making character unstoppable machine combat lot enjoyable alpha gear upgrades feel much immediately impactful getting around map lot easier well addition shrines quick travel flight paths instead dictating power levels gear based meaning catch friend power level really fast nobody feels left behind also dont waste several levels worth experience unlock boatsglidersreins like alpha find theyre immediately usablehowever flaws refind utility items every zone gets little annoying direction heavily depends getting town roaming npcs give relevant information quests dont might feel little aimless new zone overall might everybody especially averse large changes still fun especially group friends id say well worth price tag especially sees future updates improvements game interesting one though think game regressed alpha version believe still fun going new world starting anew learning worlds enemies game ton fun problem fun time limit get powerful able sweep

alphaitems armor region locked excluding artifacts equipment makes game less get good items blitz game less restart every region region system needs improvement idea good execution isnt hot maybe countries took space like regions depending powerful country would betteroverall still enjoy game definitely things could improved feel confined one region get good items region game applies certain type people dont think deserves hate getting bad game could use improvement game heart cube world however needs lot work nonetheless wonderful game years ago except odd region specific equipment leveling system still fun game also people game made spare time priority commendable came pretty decent components made cube world great needs updates game awesome friends game awesome first wasnt

play friend spawned km apart really hope change future playable right game classic ill support way first giving positive review game decently different alpha im sure liked better yet first bit crawl usual ive heard resets cause game act way quite biteither way wollay made game practically quite accomplishment im glad able support alpha game definetly used greatly changed aspects definetly bad game still fun play though changes quite annoying lead hard enjoy game nearly long new build current price point dont know id buy unless money really isnt issue game wouldve much worth despite changes fact dont enjoy like used game really good especially take consideration made one personso tldr good game buy youre expecting cube world old whole game current state game definitly expected managed get cube world first back sank hours game exploring leveling ranger get epic gear eventually got boring repetetivenessthe release taken different approach community situation feels hello games launched game mans sky salty expected reality actually offersif look game objectively think fun exploring encountering different creatures one downside encountered artifacts going several hours figuring get artifact sometimes walking around aimlessly trying figure find said dungeon know navigate map super easy find artifact give climbing speed made confused hoping would maybe give boosts like example permanent damage boosts boost certain items maybe something bit like diablo get enhancements suddenly lifesteal maybe attacks aoe damage keep naming forever get pointif wollay already completely disheartened negative reviews highly encourage try figure different kind artifacts would way go game empty horrendously balanced void tutorials missing certain functionality like leveling past one think anything id say enjoyable playtime reason made almost hours long takes actually travel anywhere game fabulous everything fantasticto begin real cube world release version taken best alpha everything love removed flaws wrapped exciting finalised package let explain many reviews hate changes people complain gear regionlocked feel dont see main goal game used old cube world gigantic empty regions need wander around exploring lands one played ton alpha know like imagine quests simply need anymore developer added elaborated quest system reason keep entertained times goal game like many others complete quests almost fun possibly get game became fast dynamic levelling aka gearing quick lets complete quests one progress super fast lucky drops reach toprarity gear within twothree hours compared absolute days gameplay alpha simply need xp levels stupid grinding bosses action people respond yeah game reward anything ill say wrong rewards ton fun like old cube world better faster snappier feels like decent pc upgrade whats better fun endless start time need create another character become overpowered onehit strongest bosses simply choose another location enjoy new exciting adventure therefore vision new cube world simply good complete tenhour play repeat many times want games replayed even fewer give unique experience every time priceless course cherry cake gives artifacts get keep goal game essential part artifacts nothing little bonus upgrade skills choose wisely try get one upgrade actually would like makes whole lot fun main thing sum say definitely recommend game especially havent played alpha get cube world feeling familiar versions probably sceptical release hope review make give another chance try feel game game fantastic exceptions solo play seems interesting really havent given shot mainly playing multiplayer fun get explore vast world friends making jokes laughing entire way onto cons dont xp system rather based artifacts lot fun really slows progression come think progression doesnt really exist region based second leave region might well start new character would like see go back days alpha progression farther went spawn harder things far would recommend game give game fantasticif played alpha might disappointed see many things changed urge play open mindi think wollay done game fantastic opening end game many possibilities infinite replayability grindy xp levelling system replaced regional equipmentbased levelling overall artefactbased stat improvement system first might think region locking issue opinion promotes exploration finishing one region another also enables play friend matter character leveli would definitely recommend game anyone interested explorationbased rpgs game fantastic little kids looking spoon fed everything want instantly meant immature brats looking max level right away get instant gratification game meant person wants earn get play game long time enjoy adventure leveling pace meant challengingpay attention downvotes kids want everything want right away without earning real game kids game focused around running around hour baiting enemies friendly npcs collect gold drop game players like exploring vast open game world case nearly infinite want grindingfighting therethis game players search deep interconnected lore complex characters thingsi like idea region based progression system allows game challenge player continuously game offeres good amount content variety though procedurally generated games limits means point game encounter repetetive patterns however think developers really good job minimizing effectsi definetely recommend game new playersnote many negative reviews players dont like changes made since alpha release nevertheless think good game game fun becomes repetitive hope game continues updated added add type leveling system ways improve multiplayer feels clunky play friends go area map makes world feel little bit empty would still recommend cube world boring current state game fun still much game back alpha changes encourage keep exploring past normally would back alpha yes problems artifacts dont feel rewarding enough developer isnt great communication think lot uproar based around game fun ways alpha changes keep exploring longer always favorite partthe game definitely wasnt released normal way problems small fixes think game would amazing good game fun first hours alpha player lack content past first hours quite disappointing spawn quests quickly go crappy gear overpowered gear head next region endless cycle gets stale incredibly quickly fact way really progress game gain artifacts give incredibly minor buffs useless stats means reward progression hope wollay reconsiders region locking brings back least skills artifacts provide true rewards skills continue playing see everything game offer leave negative review even though honestly dont want wollay changes something game god tier game good yeah context wikihow game overall fun wouldnt recommend solo game great except one thing region locking loot believe since many people dislike wollay probably change doesnt somebody inevitably make mod game great im much fun discovering every zone game great everything wished alpha like exploration based games love game promisethe game pretty simple create character go hand holding quest markersthis game one core loop goes look stuff defeat repeat equiped face dungeon region defeat boss get artifact finish region region start step never become powerful feel mastered whole world artifacts form permanent progresscombat simpleyour offensive options light attacks heavy attacks sometimes class specific skillyour defensive options dodging warrior block running life healingmy gripe artifacts much impact gameplay wise buff non combat stats increased gear game great landbound progression isnt bad players make seem theyre used alpha version game pussies cant handle change youve never heard game extremely fun highly recommend buying game hella fun good friends play get bit boring game honestly one best games ive ever played need play trust game impossible start alone prepare spend hours searching weapon class mage weapons pile bag course friend two playing different classes always let carry best get oneshot gear actually use drops game incredibly underwhelming considering alpha better game big oof game pain play multiplayer least peertopeer basis laggy rubberbanding everywhere combat chore deal meaningful rewards enemies sometimes enemies drop nice gear wont even class traveling mostly walking around food everywhere get needed item ride animal everything kinda feels boring wanted enjoy game based remember years years ago aint chief game fun remember first played years ago gameplay decisions made dont agree region locked weaponry stale gameplay one region still love game wollay plans continuing feed content game continue play years come game boringnot bad great boringand make game exploring entire world discovering lore said world collecting artifacts make character stronger boring youve done something wrongunless game gets major updates line actually becomes fun dont buy gamefind play alpha instead much better game like bowl cereal except instead milk devs decided use lukewarm water game like funny joke strongly recomended buy crap played circa hours alpha game unplayable level entrance new player high bad class balance game nice play love dont care people says wollay still updating game love game longer alpha much clashing game design makes experience fun gear region locked makes getting kind loot pointless leveling system means point killing anything information hidden player reason literally go devs twitter find important gameplay information dev hasnt said anything since games official launch dont hope update anytime soon dont buy game game remembered playing alpha many years ago good memories expected get similar experience instead developer yet abandoned supportive community instead even addressing anything gone radio silent game everyone certainly enjoy game everyone tired standard rpg formula maybe give try favorite parts rpgs start getting butt kicked everything every scrap loot god send yes cube world lose gear start move zones negative reviews complaining though best part geared untouchable longer fun enough power fantasy games jam hard findcompleting area like playing hour adventure rpg enough price id say enjoyed want play move new area start adventure new settingbiomealso playing coop much easier start new area together equals friend plays work levels doesnt understand dont want group anymore game good fun times mostly laughing absurdity game friendsbesides fact game promised people gotten worsethe main goal game collecting artifacts dont give anything useful gliding speed thanks thatll really handy exploring next area oh wait dont glider anymore equipment exploration tools regionlocked thats fun honestly wish hadnt bought game years ago encouraged make garbagevisual game great opinion worth buythere many areas improved vastly alpha gotten worsestarting hard next gear engagements difficult win youll avoid fighting unless npcs nearby pick weak enemy group fight one one get good gear progressing starts pick pacethe quests stuff great give something goal work towards rewarded good stuff much better aimless alphathe shrines life good bad provide fast travel points great much appreciated also respawn points must find one respawn really sucks go long way quest die respawn way back run trip way back little annoyingthe region locked gear massive downer completed every quest found starting land decided move next happened ocean sailing went past boundary boat disappeared many items lost strength really sucks grinding playing naught gave upthere cool new abilities know ranger since thats one ive played close range kick gone close quarters combat options really lame shadow shooter cool ability like still wish kickthe game music think good different music title screen victories different biomes etc like lotvillages much cooler though game music vast improvement npcs little say new races enemy mobs cool progression system stops playing beyond founding region dont feel tempted go see new stuffmixed feelingsif youre sure dont buy full price hopefully itll go sale point game nearly bad people saying biggest issue people game region lock system thought pretty good idea old game grinded character amazing fair took decent amount time get point oneshot literally everything anywhere map youre done new region lock system helps remedy problem always giving something im saying system perfect people complaining aboot nothing far perfect actually get bit repetitive think system good idea poorly executedanother issue people game compared alpha fact skill trees removed dont gain exp also problem reason kill monsters small chance getting leftovers weapon piece armour still get skills class like ninja throw shurikens get right away progression whatsoeverin end think game isnt bad everyone else making alpha still enjoyable respect developer trying something new region lock system really seen rpgs perhaps dev put thought itis game worth bucks maybe chance would update im keeping hopes never seen go sale still worth moment game perfect game world still lacks lot thingsbut creators made game amazing however wish cubeworld would tagged earlyaccess game keeps improving game used developed alpha phase playing feels really slow progressing exploring gaining

awful one simple reason removed sense progression used level get better gear always skills whenever enter new regionarea legendary items become useless youre back square onethe permanent upgrades tiny move speed upgrades game amazing dogshit horrible leveling system wish way used alpha game better years ago would better find version trash game better area locked equipment thing game fun first got lucky got basic gear drops enemies near spawn found village close starter experience pretty good curious wasnt gaining experience killing mobs found experience read post artifacts new way level sort magical item increases level quests got blues purples found dungeon looked like old style one alpha got artifact dungeon moderately boring fight got first legendary piece close new area went found blue mob attacked got slapped silly confused went back time gliding fell glider change new zone get gear removed idea happens top level gained doesnt give new abilities increase stats way need sort character progression new skills better gear want something work towards play hours legendary gear probably wont play experience added dont get downgraded leaving zone maybe play let sure game fun back literally change game yeas ago fun u enemies health almost oneshot worth buying game good alpha back went silent years updates stopped playingi tried playing recently came steam like totally different game died almost immediately start game everything killing stuff remember couldnt couldnt figure cant recommend game game getting regular updates responding feedback might positive creator tendency go silent years produce massive changes totally change game mostly worst game great smells like broken promises point cant recommend game less features alpha years ago skill tree removed gear region locked progression system great either first item ever found legendary wand quadrupled health times damage starting gear starting gear way absolutely nothing mobs get hit everything gear stronger variants starting gear unique weapons makes game feel repetitive skill based movement every enemy face hugs really dodge run around pillar hopefully game gets substantial updates would play againbad things aside game fun hours played completed entire region got cool gear would like play friends tough bosses game great played high school back however changes longer recommend fun anymore feels like different game really sad happened cubeworld game highly anticipated wollay working years however stopped updating uploaded anything since week release enjoyed cube world alpha beta trainwreck recommend anyone find alpha version cubeworld thats cubeworld fell love game hyped like mans sky feels lackluster truthfully want like game cant come waited years essentially polished turd

truly perfect balance talent changed dev team atacked truly wonderful place harmony game one bought alpha first came sunk lot time friends couldnt wait update creator however vanished didnt show posting small teasers twitter day came released steam included new content however hopes game dashed right starting play everything fun enjoyable alpha ripped left bland skeleton everything region locked feels like make progress overall good experience creator also vanished feelings hurt game steam one purchase game serves line pocket dev cries corner mean reviewers game exciting back alpha however fun features made game great removed replaced tedious region locking system game fun playing first region loses charm equipment items worked get rendered uselessthat said find playing equipment skill leveling systems tweaked reintroduced alpha build seemingly losing progression takes away fun coming someone put hours alpha build cant find playing since slow tedious game play hope see wollay come hiding continue put game game trash like excited multiplayer didnt work bro game wack would never play game rave years years ago shame legacy thrown dirtnew update isnt anything poor excuse progression loopdont get wrong id love give good review really would good aspects buy unless something major changes unlikelyat least didnt pay game wasnt ready full release fully expected enjoy lengthy early access period steamsimply put theres severe lack features progression busted right super punishing towards player actually choose explore entire game generates really anything unique memorable terrain generation also worse alpha thats kindof lot comes actual beta years ago better state game full release right nowim hoping wollay listens feedback actually works playerbase instead dipping never responding criticism tossed way want game improved dont buy right honestly experience entirety game within first zone hours game went fun action packed exploration game frankly really good rpg really bad essentially rpg elements exist game like game either gone really really poorly thoughtoutexecuted personally dont think wouldve hard take alpha state game add content release wollay years work instead reason unbeknownst everything made game fun taken away first started playing watered version cube world genuinely fun quickly changed theres sense reward progression exploration aspect feels like punch face due issues forcing explore top issues game unbelievably difficult good reason anyone would start playing game probably die many many time first hour realize mobs kill easily feel like happened hardtoo resource dependent make content game combat wollay decided making game terribly boring grindfest real end goal would make game feel like substance either way isnt worth please wait see updates come attempt fix problems game kick ass early rank gear youll struggle defeat foes get going youll game like perfect visuals good sound design simple yet fun combat system leave starting region star gear becomes worthless flaw massive hopefully one day itll change get challenging player important could least create illusion character still powerful infinitely increasing monster stats loot stats regions game think reviews say fun game worse alpha disagree alpha levelling system beat left one shotting literally everything infinite quick progression made game boring days version however theres slow progression things dont directly affect combat gameplay might stay every time leave region stays fun way game great way spend time friends extremely satisfying get good weapon area refreshing get new area game would amazing purchase guy named frost game would perfect actual leveling system region locking gear game would pretty good different liked alpha steam release unpleasant games pretty disappointing wollayd actually spent time flesh expand upon progression alpha wed much extensive game somewhere within last months year wait threw opted different means progression say happens somewhere within last months twitter post wollay made months ago shows exp still thinginstead getting fleshed rpg experience base alpha expanding instead got last minute attempt reworking core gameplay attempt combat power bloat works dont find fun game made seems emphasis exploration exploring randomly generated landscapes sprinkle hand crafted structures simply isnt fun mei enjoyed grinding getting stronger taking strength continue grow take bigger threats strength strictly based equipment becomes obsolete leave region getting stronger time getting better equipment gather artifacts area ever slightly increase exploration speed lantern light radius move onto next region start games systems inherently flawed could write book said worthy successor alpha enjoyable yes first region two comes ugly realization hard progression outside making ephemeral movement artifacts slightly better greater goal work giving game short lived gameplay loop top myriad problems hasis worth checking sure sale cheap happy cube world finally getting updated time actually got chance play betai feel like would better wollay let game fade past game fun hours redo everything old one better dungeons leveling new one barely anything last game laggy gear rare thats kinda part made fun well unless updates game deadi technicaly got game free since bought alpha game say simply full good bad ugly gave game thumbs given still works opinion holds remains seen first game lot promise much potential content already put shows game lot love itthe goodtrue word games map procedurally generated like minecraft two maps even items randomized certain extent unfamiliar game plays part like rpg kill enemies go quests obtain items character explore world around game much playable part enjoyable later got hang mechanics alot fun itthe controls part hard learn besides standard wsad space combinations maps zoom feature quite welcome one see landscape even one hasnt visited area yet makes finding nearest town spawn point activate much easier helps planning routes different points possible interest rather neat visit different nooks crannies see mobs could spot loot could obtain find npcs talk tothe pet system remains prior version nice fun find corgie find reins ride around map little doggo whos good boy youre good boy badthe camera wee bit hard control times particularly climbing attacking long range makes fighting mental panic mode bit hard killed many many times trying get bead opponent well leveling system changed alpha version standard experience system sort find better gear mechanic made going opponents much tougherit help step another zone gears abilities useless including boat climbing gear spirit bell special item found every zone start square one annoying boat sailing mainland hit ocean zone suddenly boat useless gain access crossing back prior zone ocean nothing water several islands find boat required lot slow swimming island island islandthe enemies really act like thriving ecosystem enemies one would think would attack paced back forth moving others patrol zones without even much farting

fun mess around definitely wouldnt devote chunks time grinding soloall game much potential severe contradicting design choicestldr thumbs overall gameplay newly added mechanics heavily reduce enjoyment clearly originally made pure adventure gameas early alpha player review based past present experiencesvery indie games made excited future much cube world foundation simple enjoyable yet time would fly whenever sat played game reason pure joy going adventure never really knowing random cliff suchthe beta update core gameplay extremely conflicting ideas could seperated create different modes instead main gameprosartifacts items made significantly enticing run dungeons due permanent stat increases came though im disappointed increase damagedefenseregions way variety beta havent seen every structure type yet excited see biomes may addedcoop fact easily travel truly blessing would like constant hpmp bar party members like alpha thoughcombat similar alpha slightly expanded super simple yet tactical fighting something pretty much one shot great work partyconsregion lock biggest gripe world would add region lock key items lost moving another region like hitting brick wall middle playthrough would fine losing weapons losing glider rein boat thats little insane also affects farming items id need couple yellows go get artifact three throw everything away move onto next region item feels insignificant even carry coinciding regions also ruins point farming materials like wood oresgeneration though enjoy new structures seems obvious im going run map encourages skip several places rather check everything world bosses randomly placed world would nicequests give reward going back town npc easier find reward going area clearing talking npc town honestly pointless pretty much see everything map anyways outside possible key itemimprovementsremove region locking key items make one key item findable per regionadd consistent way items certain amount cubes added

feel lost shoved world information rather games progression system confusing choicethe loot drops cool playing mage class playthrough around hours already grinding bosses available every single drop compatible mage pardoning odd pet item means hard time making progression mage ended switching warrior make use items already gained tried exploring world got boat found self stuck water swimming despawns alongside loot go different biome map feature opinion makes sense halts progress makes restart scratch time want go take look around world could see fun situations option turn would nice playthrough many others like luckily already saint modding community game already fixed problem running tool every time launch game play way probably first placei understand acquire items gobetween biomes yet run rare way would like play continue play game little maybe even stream two probably wont last long unless major changes made took look developers main social media seems gone back radio silence mode replying anyones questions complaints shame would love hear thinking anything correct flaws game hasi played alpha stages game well really want upvote positive review good alpha cant changes made correct course gamei rate game disappointing shell former game much else say theres hardly anything new brag thing truly different fun sucked masterpiece game hope wollays sake handle negativity hes receive rip cube world step back alpha people may find fun region locked weapons character essentially starting every region isnt fun longer action based rpg roguelite tough one recommend still game incredible amount potential world pretty cool would fun explore wasnt empty would mechanics varied quests place small dev team implement features fix progression system open game modding could become next big game tricky one im recommending caveats think might tough game enjoy solo ive playing strictly coop weve definitely gotten twenty bucks fun need really enjoy starting feeble kit building powerful kit splatting big bad immediately returning feeble kit short fast cycle repeat new region travel lot salt reviews stems inability gain meaningful permanent strength instead reset noob levels new zone think interesting attempt avoid power creep definitely everyonemy frustrations game need either better torch less realistically black night way camp quickly forward dawn movement night meant punitive needs better ways mitigate little permanence game would help feel invested im frothy perregion gear still frustrating run exact loop every single zone home base stash artifacts trophies way keep mountboathangglider zone zone maybe customize really feel need something breaks sameyness biggest frustration easily howlermonkeylike reaction developer received sixyearold game sold time great whopping fortune likely ensured hes going vanish ether never touch game hope im wrong hell reappear sure dont blame never disappointing game played alpha hundreds hours loved itwollay dev abandoned game ran moneyfor new players might like played alphasave free code money fun game play bit find hard start picked ranger getting ass handed basic enemies got past really enjoyed game playhowever fan progression system feel like progress really fast lucky finishing region feels unrewarding great wont transfer artifacts get region increase quality life things faster riding speed light radius stamina consumption ect doesnt really help make progression feel different rewarding feel like starting game every regionbut things like combat think map amazing region feels unique unique animals enemies feel like lot effort put map really like joining friend smooth great experiences playing friendshere would like see would like see change progression system make finishing region feel rewarding especially buff artifacts feel like increase something make better damage resistance health ect biggest fan start gear useless new region would willing feel like got buffed everytime finished regionin end really hope dev makes progression system hope doesnt give see many negative comments especially lone dev really painful see really hope updates game becomes games ment abandoned good game played aplpha hours really like game doesnt get boring became op way much gear game became dull still boss battles dungeons still mostly became boring game soooo good wander arround always fun talk everyone soo cool give quest info funny also get good region usually explored mostly region get artifact game gets even better change region keep artifact gold etc lose gear making forced explore progress learn lore stuff different pages inventory soo brag front friends still materials gold find crafting book directly make stuff conclusion played game back recently turned still love much even amazing changes thanks wolframm weird game reason fun anymore played dont know many years ago loved boring reason shame also feels bit overpriced receive wrong shouldnt back enjoying alpha release dare youyou stolen dreams excitement empty update im one lucky ones people never experienced alpha people never experienced glory game dare amazing game always well worth wait ive sat years im glad finally showed equipmentbased exploration rpg vanilla doesnt suit mod like would bethesda game good game understand might recommend said dont recommend please civil developer hes good place right interesting game closed beta cube world changed dramatically simple elegant alpha version many things beta improved compared alpha systems game downright stupid alpha version start game every new character challenging bit grindy changed drastically new beta start challenging grindy alpha would generally improve character levelling acquiring better gear supplemented levelling character progression pretty stupid whole idea levelling getting artifacts pretty silly time consuming also reaps little benefits short term completely understand version aims encourage player explore many game systems also punish player exploring encourage explore removing special items shop scattering throughout biome fine problems one thing really dont like fact gear useless every biome except one found game element forces player stay inside starting biome therefore discourages exploration overall game systems quite counterintuitive take fun game also make extremely confusing beginning players feel game extreme potential shown start alpha feels wasted game would much better removed stupid features replaced traditional solutions coming someone little time alpha really worried buying game negative reviews hours say love entirely may missing things shown wollay may game everyone wanted far highly captivated excited exploring discovering world charm lacking games years im much fun questing figuring everything im excited able another region xp gain knowledge im blind see region lock clearly flawed system doesnt mean im loving every minute far removed original game vision people bought fun sucked dont bother buying dev vanished seriously dont believe anymore work done shame potential spent many hours proper previous version sure different game original alpha released however still incredibly fun especially friends ton replayability highly recommend game looking forward seeing wollay pixie future going review game also reviews trying ruin reputation game want say right reviewed played hoursdont listen cause chaos ruin good game would recommend looking reviews playing game least hours includes dont want see rest keep scrollingthings keep mind game made people hobby game everyone remember saw first alpha many things change alpha many things change future people desire always going get expect wollay isnt mind reader cant make everyone happy

runs smooth even lowend combat learning curve certain enemies careful however need look tier mobs capable worlds beautiful look may reallife type scenery times look lay land feel immersed voxel admit bugs game lowend laptop things wont render like title screen given time eventually renderoverall still young game even alpha came years ago given enough time much fun game like favorite baker makes best chocolate chip cookies world guy moves away eventually comes back town first thing makes sour dough raisin cookie like waiting years get degree clean toilets mcdonaldswatch take game first probably last time ever leaving steam review hopes maybe hear community make changesnot full review game fun anyone saying wasnt enjoyable lying potential game sadly cut short hoping first time enjoy complete first zone thats excitement ends game got hours got times worth guess fun play friends kidsfamily thats new favourite game everyones hating dev made big mistakes played hours game friends first week c losed beta fun ive long timethe reviews mixed early game extremely challenging still extremely fun game ive already spent hours cube world alpha way better feel like cash grab continuation vision saw alpha product instead entirely new direction unenjoyable one imagine playing windwaker every new island got sword longer damage hookshot gone need find king red lions nowhere seen start game every hours ten complete region get utility bonuses like gliding speed shame cant keep glider though good luck finding next meter lantern range also blitz getting artifacts create even shorter gameplay loop youd likeif enjoy version game power product expected backing alpha release perfect game bad game either six years silent development brought objectively good changes bad changes new quest system absolutely brilliant game even lively atmospheric personally like concept artifacts something newif dont mind region locked gear makes work every hours know id like see improved

updated alpha signed years ago things change time obvious roadmap tells completely different story paid said even worth giving proper review bad real bad one best games ive ever played people forget still early access theyre thinking finished game new beginning game region locking creates opportunity infinite gameplay pets new dungeons mobs kill make game much enjoyable well think game lost content hasnt quests still leveling still bosses still new different six years ago fact theres still much content within weeks available play impressive enough would always buy pathetic wanted end development game couldve done exactly insisted keeping peoples hopes released unfinished rush job steam called day years showed gameplay new update quests bosses dragons way back isnt game removed old version website get people buy cheap clone even like game story surrounding sad years works get version less content possibly one ambitious games ive seen far two people theme far perfect however quite enjoyable figure mechanics might take however quite rewarding actually see progression progress enjoyable playing friends found quite enjoyable discovering new things game found helpful myselfkeep mind game development two peoplepros unique game makes everything feel fresh harder rewarding actually forces gather informationcons unfinished game lot work example earlier stages camp possessed bosses leaves green tiered weapons early games basically boosting away need take events classes dont equal amounts class skills mage special attacks classes shift gives mage extra abilities etc music disappears youre spot long might pro making switch spots faster however feels quite lonely singleplayer ci dont recommend game people rely minecraft wiki get mean yeeah game grabs people enjoy exploration want figure smart ways play enjoy game unpolished diamond game give time order become something game game support community creator dont tosic probably going minority opinion game goodi bought original alpha version game years ago first came put probably hours course years since since getting beta access ive put probably hours beta week alonethere lot upset people alpha version disagree changes progression regionlocked gear aspects game understand complaints frankly first heard changes game kneejerk reaction played game ready start shoveling dirt onto game last week playing beta turned around completely new direction game long time follower game try explain believe new version goodlets flashback alpha first massive game endless exploration infinite leveling grinding monsters gear followed typical rpg rules staying traveled thats well good exactly one would expect rpg problem alpha version game despite skill trees exp based leveling persistent gear games always ended way friends around level would everything unlocked game reduced handgliding across areas minutes stopping every stomp boss seconds go back gliding rinse repeat massive areas reason stop explore reason visit towns reason talk npcs skill tree added illusion character customization reality served little purpose since combat related skills unlocked almost nothing except reducing cooldown abilities seconds per levelthe beta takes bolder riskier design approach class abilities unlocked right form start treats zone almost game instead flying skimming bosses area adventure start fresh talk townsfolk try learn artifacts key items regionally found set explore every nook cranny area areas littered content rewards player regionally within zone saving captured gnome boost regions shops sell better gear finding rare crafting book unlocks new crafting recipes area finding shrines unlocks new place revive die double unlockable fast travel locations makes finding rewarding useful finding reins boat glider gives player quality life mobility upgrades explore area better dungeons far larger alpha reward players rare artifacts level player rewarding small passive boosts swimming climbing sailing riding skills none combat related carry leave regionthe new system akin playing randomizer everytime enter new area start weak pleb thoroughly explore area key items improve quality life trying get better gear let tackle regions bigger threats ultimately get artifactsso big issue people fact move onto new region old gear reduced basic starter gear new area unless super rare piece equipment rare items retain old power neighboring areas debate detractors gear never diminished leave area sounds good theory literally flies face literally content thats designed last years literally every aspect games content based around new progression system allowing players keep gear new system would devolve game back alpha version flaws shallow gameplay consists flying zones snipe bosses levels new system lot longevity reverting old system would completely invalidate literally new contentthe current system perfect always rooms improvement growth much played alpha take rosecolored glasses recognize major flaws led stagnation gameplay hours artifacts could broadened give wider array passive bonuses stats even miniscule amounts cities could provide information region explaining many artifacts hidden found everything could sort reward full clearing region game could also better job explaining new players foundation development continues post launch get even betterat end day though current version game blast play single player cant say alpha boring quickly solo retaining multiplayer experience thats fun play friends joining games friends easy via ingame menu works great minus occasional dc simply requires reinvite new progression system means dont need worry multiplayer sessions ruined one friends plays much since meeting new regions brings people back mostly level playing field minus swimming climbing little faster suchi look forward seeing evolution game foundation blast play well worth asking price given amount hours ive already played week beta im sure lot detractors praising alpha denouncing progression system certainly right going everyone different game used honestly better game play game fun quite vast challanging game got play friend simple enough find even far apart big learning curb grindfest levels finding way earn money start getting better equip worth playing world much offer lore endless find playing lot many hours support devs worked hard long review left dr kawashima literally cant say better self agree everything sais biggest disappointment ive experienced year keeping short dont start ranting frustrationi dont even know say rpg lootemup exploration fantasy game without combat levelling rpg persistent loot collect fun exploration mechanics beyond basic fantasy elementsthis isnt game done yet long shot buy first time ive ever refunded steam game game general dissapiontment immesureable life ruined really high hopes game waited years shame fun friends enjoy type game trust issues never change working things others build project good basethings already work dont necessary sweep away experiments isnt game paid isnt promised us waited long produce dare spit us little remorse isnt alpha thats okay different sure take great want alpha play alpha warned isnt chiefthere nitpicks overall like die pet doesnt respawn one district final dungeon requires main item isnt found district classes different used alpha new system learned want put timebut new features pretty cool district adventure clean slate replayability seemingly endless coins carry well handful items marked district means equippable district surrounding area end main quests star dungeons receive relic level character relic adds small buff like swimming speed sailing multiplayer built steam friends list makes easy join friends teleport points quicktraveling huge helpoverall cool game diehard fans expect years hard workme personally fan bothif reading picroma thank launch great failure many years regression gameplay really progression terrible almost nonexistant dont think need explain read anyone elses review theres point playing gear gonna resetseverely disapointed especially since supported game many years ago might biggest review ill make anyways cube world actually fun game progression kind good though yes prefer alpha progression system since could infinitely level enemies would scale levelthe removal skill tree really completely disnecessary skill tree great needed tweaking skillslevels game useless means many artifacts player nothing else nothing morethe artifacts really useless effects really small ones could obtained improved leveling upgrading items receive effect wollay decided thatregionlocking biggest problem far except isnt people including progression system works think making items like boats hanggliders reins also region locked bit much theyre pretty usefulnow honestly think progression systems good dont think good solution problem would make choice creating character would old progression system current progression systemlastly think old map generation added back way better since map generated went new places unfortunately hope wollay come back actually change game hasnt contacted community week wife new cube world fundamentally different paid alpha unique aesthetic would completely unrecognizable point game play put frankly unsatisfying points multi page reviews common enough wont even try cover everythingthere real sense progression level skill gear absolutely essential rpgthere exploration map static seeds gone fully revealed start quest system one biggest advertised changes alpha release really falls flat release version add lore story may enough seems come cost game play overall game gives level satisfaction dinner fast food joint long ago name burger joint made quality food may still shiny colorful look beyond wrapper illusion sustenance falls completely hype cube world actually benefits sordid past everyone knows personally knows someone participated infamous paid alpha trick story cube world propelled well beyond whatever would achieved fully released game drama wont say game worth getting would say release version worth price serious updates wait least sale game updated happy change review review parts focus game second part expands information developer game full promise potential great idea poor execution game feels like early access title decent visuals make fun world explore unfortunately last minute gameplay changes make exploration pointless combat feels mediocre crafting system useless lots bits pieces ideas dont play well together alpha backed years ago skill systems leveling systems mattered actual persistent open world explore systems scrapped years massive leap backwards game offers part developer simply cant deliver game zero communication support seems completely touch made alpha promising exciting years practically progress made game feels last months changes thrown together steam release cash grab cant recommend support dev already game theres still good fun found shallow unfortunate state wouldnt dare touch asking price say least buying incomplete tech demo best review written release game

towards bspoiler dont pay full price spoilerb much hate video game industry game ever perfect play like like game much harder alpha requires high computer specs worth thing hardly call cube world knew mean everyone played alpha poor mans version originallyi actually miss blue mist unloaded areas alpha miss wait around game load lack music npcs killed without question cube world game picking fights eventually curb stomping areas knewthis thing call takes hours life gain star equipment imidiately worse star equipment zone single footstep away also hope dont like equipment gather thats repeating contenti loved game cannot say good would recomend ever wollay ever gives us something even close alpha still forgive hell put us payed money alpha expected something like eventually exist years upon years waiting playing got messi happy witty joke entity grabbed skin cube world draped nothing every like unlikely ever enjoy iti feel like even steam store page abandoned dev alpha liked game much actually understandable gave us form communication besides yearly tweet never responding created amalgum told us swallow bullshit complainedwollay used consider respecting good day sir loseaddendum also miss namepet felt right version cube world feels like hes testing campaign story mode back alpha like free roam game modein another years might get version focus pvp years might get full game version mixed one play want would say ignore buy ever goes high sale version cube world completely sucks loved alphaguessing wont see changes anyways hes make couple millions sales disappear another version game works items stats bound area ultimately grind beat dungron earn passive buff like mount speed increase stay grind give slight advantage adjacent zones rince repeat forever game really interested playing back alpha sudden disappearance developer came big disappointment fast forward week ago excitement came back short time much game changed comparing released version alpha dont think changes best played hours trying work rewarding new progression system would tried class instructions able one shot mob time pretty awful way start progressed nonetheless end left nothing reset waiting next zone ultimately respect fact design changes made alpha shows clearly motivation developer improve upon game even official product wasnt greatit may nostalgia days playing back alpha bummer walk away game excited years ago negative things say wishing best luck wollay dont think anyone paying game game everyone knew played alpha hyped first time playing friends fun soon went new region fun died playing solo isnt fun whatsoever updates game going remain dead another years good game back alpha wollay removed features added didnt even put features showed twitter great disappointment compared old one even good game lot things left unclear confusing real guide formatting menus didnt help labels would really helped guess using small pictures right better alphai want like game dont combat okay thats really isthis stayed drafts easily one favorite rpgs like many others stopped playing awhile game stopped developing loooong time back development seems also steam great thought saw negative reviews decided take look anyway yeah f would take away experience skill tree system game good loved many needed content updates changes please fix game still love every aspect game except progression makes unplayable highly anticipated game alpha buyerafter playing beta im mixed feelings like game dont like design choices herei think wollay removed many rpg elements present alpha version taking away much core gamewollay basically made entirely new game exploration based game rpg like game alpha version wasthe main problems version region locking certain core elements paraglider boat stuff live dont really see gear region locked mean truly wanted every region start anew gear existoverall like game gets boring far early thats bummeri really hope game gets alot content updates future childhood game hearing coming back steam years made happybut played game graphics never fail impress level system means skills gear gets removed new biome enter matter beat lot dungeons get small permanent boost stats like sailing faster something along lines doesnt really make wanna keep going new biome play game general honestly released alpha version eurosbucks would happy play hours wasnt expecting bought game hoping would still stuff alpha add lots stuff creator posting twitter would recommend find way get alpha first ever serious review pains make thisi personally much say game alpha player always alpha playerdo take say heart personal opinioncube world game made today seeing game plumit amazing alpha half arsed beta hurts anything else waited years thisthe region lock immediately set tyrant game whole point huge game like explore gear understand drop rate possible zone luck godthe removal exp alright way level game something fond leveling requires artifacts give minimal boost utility combatfinally way wollay changed combat abysmal best change hurt game either keep distance ranged class die close combat class worse need exploit random allies region even slim chance harder enemies understand need fight white tier enemies become powerful alpha fight whatever wanted long skill kill itwollay please listen community want nothing best man hope things go well future seeing next mans sky right hurts soul see waymay game get better show true game meansedit also anyone wishes comment believe right thing game means alpha players explain greatest moment playing cube world indefinitely unfinished developer abandoned even get fixed chances years time download alpha version much better well tough one genuinely believe game potential comparing version game infinitely better completely different direction played lot cubeworld back day past self would incredibly happy came update gamein playtime ive already good moments walking house immediately blown witches flying lakes lava trying obtain item discovering lore falling incredible world createdthat said couple problems main issue game region locks equipment every time travel new region equipment lost start scratch understand mechanic implemented try add longevity peoples playtime massive amounts content interesting topic look kept equipment wouldnt necessarily always feel need complete regions new regions may feel boring however losing equipment warning kind slap face experience felt like reason lose equipment would fine happens abruptly seemingly reasonanother con starting never fight creatures every enemy way strong fight even basic sheeps pigs curbstomp least make life incredibly difficult needs way balance enemies spawn areas least offer interesting ways fight hired help joining current npc party anything reallyproswell world generation overall feel game outstanding far improved cubeworld play multiplayer longer wander endless realms trying meet bootleg server instead servers hosted steam stable able fast travel friends region game irl cost unlockable equipment fun use changes experience based many pieces equipment havethe design creatures game general fun creativei genuinely think playing game squad friends best way go could get lot value playing others especially groups kind game problem games accomplish well better think game fun cdn funi appreciate work put steam im hoping well see consistent updates roll one games keep eye may best start love devs game amazing know jump cubeworld cubeworld steam astounding proves itll keep getting better thinking getting game would warn would also encourage get think youd like feel title stands currently direction going im sure year ill able fully recommend game anybody though recommend game moment like style concept felt unnecessarily difficult gear low level land seemed sparse mobs anywhere within decent distance starting area would one shot serious balancing needs done keep eye possibly purchase future refunded wollayi recommend game reason people give bad reviews alpha back different like look core concepts different actually pretty intriguing think changes game could almost perfect okay weapons didnt region lock think game would really lot better better fan base go new region stuff becomes really bad changed think players would like game lot added skill tree back alpha think players would like would like way tooso people think new artifact leveling sucks think skill tree level get points skill tree combined stuff talked think people would genuinely enjoy love game fromjordan players got game cant refund like meyou dun got robbed go play alpha lot better anyone wants short yes never played alpha game fantastic recommend love open world exploration rpg even roguelikescube world changed lot honestly better alpha incredibly boringand anyone owned game time ago would know cube world years away hasevolved changed relatively complete game features although may dislike inthe end likely better game never us helping achieve passion payed six years ago buying game supporting development nice enough give us game alpha always subject change honest would eat cereal however format chick strip placement completely horrible first nobody wanted cut grass know im going buy hot dog spaghetti sauce isnt good dont eat dog simple idea nobody seems understand nearly impossible come across lawn grass due locking species environment however help metal straws visco way situation honest actually love game even new changes hope gets updates enjoy iti deffinitly find game way better played multiplayer though adds life adventure honest like game seems like im one likes changes features final version dont know people expected wanted fun little game pass time nothing less nothing honestly dont feel like needed thumbs begin play alpha first became popularthis game endless potential super fun even current state voxel art done quite beatifully true description exploration based rpg enjoyed alpha much even though somewhat lower end optimization beta release seems better optimized seems much less issues however larger quests many particle effects lower frame rates overall find release game represent potential fun alpha compliment however may also seem worrying beta release represent years developmentoverall game fun dont know worth current state every piece game overwhelming potential time misses mark bit example game could addictingly fun grind world warcraft even legend zelda games could game best friends group grind quests battle hordes bosses get awesome loot well already problem often online desync huge problem multiple friends game another problem progression quests understand game focus exploration way track quests really even get npcs make start game rough top starting extremely challenging everything encounter potential oneshot youallinall leaving positive review however would recommend wait either sale dev show true palpable followthrough paid game years ago could barely play due optimization constantly looking updates optimization dev go mia years beta optimized much better lacks true additional substance fact took things alpha players liked game fun could bestselling game developer isnt committed wollay dont screw much changed alpha able enjoy enjoyed alpha probably wont enjoy beta put bluntly good rpg almost like counter rpg systems place make suffer items locked regions youre punished exploring imagine open world rpg punishing exploring leveling removed items way get stronger wouldnt problem however drop rates horrible often get items class also monsters far powerful far weak theres somehow zero inbetween finally music repetitive offers little varietyi wanted good cube world youre recommend everyone stay away start absolutely loved alfa version cube world put many hours developing character better better years looked wollays twitter random things game sure would ever release us play always hoped day would excited hear announcement update finally happening put time game things really dont like progression system doesnt keep interested going new area loose everything got last dont like find glider boat etc made sense get enough gold buy skill character use skills beginning game much better progressively tried get skills leveling combat system doesnt work good remember alfa version long boss fights barely would hang end skill would beat boss almost highest armor highest weapon star bosses still shot make smallest mistake especially true mage bosses shooting shouldnt happen built armor actually fight guys also start weak lucky like got star weapon early enemies felt way easy way soon blasting way around without even talking npc system get clues doesnt work good finished lot quests hours going around trying get clues nothing happened random npc finally gave clue reigns pets hours finally went another biome talking npc area gave clue artifact dungeon biome trying complete npcs waste time talk feel like treasure hunt see npc finally give something valuable besides much like shoeswollay completely changed game ground everything thought coming twitters changed point cant recommend game current state hope hear respond constructive criticism want best game ever wollay start youve played alpha game nothing like rememberif expected alpha build years polish isnt according wollays drip tweets completely rebuilt version made two years plays like roguelite progression entirely tied gear gear find region depowered upon moving another region one consider region run speak completed fully upon completion gain upgrades degrees permanence bring outside regionwhile would personally prefer classic rpg exp system alpha along fact made decision pay years ago would like emphasize find nothing inherently wrong system gripes gameplay cycle currently implemented cycle currently looks something like travel combat upgrade travel issues former two skill trees removed along skills characters every stage effectively four moves combat limited movement options made combat incredibly shallow compared alpha unfun subjective opinion monsters long drop exp rarely anything meaningful two coins reason moving across world means really travelling picking plants avoiding fights sucks youre going wind spending literal hours strolling point point boverall would recommend current build anyone assuming price remains usd initial grind get game awfully boring payoff efforts isnt much better try simplify feelings words possible feel like core gameplay mechanics fun however games progression system feels entirely unrewarding artifacts arent worth gathering provide small benefits exclusion point time would change nothing progression system think region locking could work artifacts significantly changed game play experience beneficial player actually felt rewarded spending however many hours get one otherwise youre simply repeating steps visible character growth obviously isnt issue game game new content since alpha though significantly less expected originally detailed roadmap new music example aspect enjoyed lot feels zeldaesque mean massive compliment core progression system area flaws still fun cube world got worth way back alpha stage cant recommend game current state character hour mostly simply got bored first region game lasted around hours alpha stage lasted far less beta stage many bugs worth imo many game play connectivity issues enjoy game much running travel items work zones gathered makes exploring new biome fun run around unpolished focusing exploration exploration often talk everyone see get locations open map mark locations manually go lowest quest highest element surprise makes exploration aspect feel unexcitingthe combat fun gets repetitive fast character classes offer shallow variety cant help make game diverse end also blame enemies dont really much else shooting afar running slash youthe progression artifacts permanently improve exploration stats swimming speed lamp radius etcthe region lockregion bound items nice touch could work great landscapes biomes structures good make places feel uniquetldr since noticeable character progression combination lack excitement exploring game gets old quite fast cant recommend sadly took wollay years make game worse impressive achievement took hours get used new mechanics would recommend eagerly look forward future updatesedit guess wrong check six years took already contentdevoid experience removed aspects game alpha infinite leveling scaling system least gave sense progression regionlocked gear taken away thing sticks regions artifacts marginally increase movement stats really noticeable fashion unfortunately game broken always likely due developers history mental health issues im saying people harass guy try force finish game actually finish game take parts game slap also disingenuous people purchased product say finished best thing wollay could game sell another company run core product finish line promised seems unlikely forgetting game existed tons us played alpha years ago came flocking back hope game would finished unfortunately feels even less developed alpha years ago took hours gear got geared figured get er done im fun purchaser alpha back really happy see game come everyone try even quite different alpha thats obviously expected got moneys worth top notch bought alpha phase glad gotten far torturing game first hour gets better finding first weappon stars ist really good end region recive surprize game hours start new region prepared torture specially ocean start boat levels artifacts useless game made exclusively coop get items classes meaning items get useless solo play recommended yet lot grow total failure even worth totally shite better ealrier ngl doesnt worth even simply remove region lock add old lvling trashalso people giving game good review good mods sensible travel takes long real way make quicker even shrine teleport system even traveling shrine destination feels slow traveling somewhere new feels even slower xp resetting progression makes feel like new character time makes feel like theres reason play real reward mostly anything game makes feel empty feel reason actually play game half playing game walking towards next unknown point interest might even inaccessible high level actually realistically able complete disregarding past game development dont think game fun worth money right main reasons long travel time noextremely little consistent character advancement trove better freechange mind trove probably fun point truly good game seeing games development made clear much work developers put game fun exploration biomes problem people agree biome equipment lock thing start isnt bad get third fourth biome thing start getting bit repetitive still good game specially multiplayer sadly didnt get much experience steam launch yet trying really hard enjoy shouldnt like removing alpha progression systems biggest mistake devs ever make maybe ignoring community running away reality time tell trying give neutral standpoint since lot people purchased back alpha versionseeing game comparing anything else prior rednitionsits fun hours realize start bonusesleftovers besides artifacts feel like playing hours start scratch new game experience something along lines climbing tiny bit faster sailing bit faster go youre looking rpg actual progression cube world game twenty bucks like grind like clicking mouse occasionally mouse constantly concerned healing items game covered excitement mmo combat system none subscription feessass aside missed shot interesting concepts progression missed target might come back revisit devs touch overall dont think worth wait maybe time two quick points front id like thank dev taking project completion game isnt terrible compelling reasons recommendcube world best summed zeldainspired exploration game minecraftstyle graphics progression gear based progression resets change regions exception gear still works surrounding regions zone unlock mobility items explore complete quests complete dungeons get artifacts mildly increase mobility item stats mostly nothing combat relatedthe good runs smoothly system brand new top end looks great assuming like art style great sense discovery explore first zone replayability trying character classesthe bad difficult early progress best bet dragging enemies wandering npcs hoping drop useful weapon luck based progression may get top tier weapon walking two npcs fighting right start may struggle couple hours trying get upgrade telling happen classes unbalanced classes obvious way sustain battle others easy assuming gear answer kindofnotfun region locking gear mechanism get gear luck relatively rare quest crafting alternate way add would help progression compelling reason play finishing first region exploring adjacent areas youve hopefully found weapon bonuses artifacts helpful core gameplay little reason pursue seeing biomes real reason continue thats compellingsummarydespite full release still feels like demonstration shell could lack endgame luck based awkwardly limited progression system limited unbalanced class choices stand things holding game back buy game expect initial fun followed wondering could better design decisions update game abandoned dev ran away money buyi would wait buy game see developer adds stuff game hours gameplay seen done everything repeat stuff meaningful

switch regions get addicted game want clear everything lol unfinished likely never finished whats worth price stay away unfortunately im going downvote game imagining would definitely change back recommend current state fun unfortunately impossible look amount playtime previous version game played almost addictively years years many included looking forward update already wonderful game already great needed tiny balance changes content update simply thatso much old charm removed sense accomplishment gone ill say world lot features feels alive actual game content next none compared truely shamei know theres things going wolfram wife mental health issues however much ask dev able take critique loyal community waited half decade moment people uttered critique hid shut posts gone dust leaving community regret waited longi still hopeful one day theyll come back one day game gets deserves many games try mimic style already taken spot unfortunately alpha progression pile disappointment fun couple hours realize cant anything anymore youre maxed gear skills levels basically anything grind unfortunately core gameplay loop lacks sort long term replayability plenty bugs lot grindy time wasting mechanics believe dev ever return fix issues people game cant good faith recommend current state manage find copy alpha much enjoyable experience unfortunately cubeworld currently stands years neglect noncommunication game removed many great gameplay aspects used cannot fathom developer would gut game like done huge disservice fanbase thumbs unfortunately simply cannot recommend game loved cube world alpha wollay made many questionable design choices continue support passion project say isnt amazing guy amazing developer game designer much harder say rip cube world much potential end could deliver unfortunately alpha version significantly better rewarding play understand want make new zone enter challenging essentially breaking gear obtained another zone including means travel like rafts makes progress made game feel like massive waste time everything receive essentually useless exploring new zones continents never felt punishing unfuni hope someday somebody mods game something good years waiting culminating bones amazing adventureexploration game game lacks much way design intuitive gameplaycontrols well character progressionworld buildinggame design unfortunately game didnt deliver much promised game bland playing makes depressed good couldve instead get play breath wild even devs didnt respond anything forums full banhappy mods unfortunately far cry promised game ended utter disappointment every time move new area might well started new character lose everything items stick around couple extra areas doesnt help overall problem hopefully things get fixed recommend game friends moment case unfortunately version cube world seems less finished alpha version region locked gear adventure game additionally complete zone move next basically restarting game unless gear start zone scratch end quests eventually start another zone thing unfortunately wasnt worth wait game largely still feels like early access game vanished years ago bare bones also weird progression system added version pretty bad effectively ruins open world nature game put way time old early access release one released years ago maybe would recommended hope perhaps would improve release point id pass especially price little game changed half decade since first popped current design game general doubt game changing updates pipeline shame unless rewards leveling get better game wont much hours gameplay people gear unusable part cross biome border keep artifacts level fine system issue artifacts give small boosts swimming speed handgliding speed ect nothing make next biome go different experience really cant recommend game current stage much prefer alpha stage game completely honest fix progression though abolutely amazing title unless theres huge update progression system game huge waist money time unless youre playing group friends game definitely worth playing progressing biomes rewarding frustrating artifacts ought give bonuses unplayable coop graphical lag every seconds years ago game still problems worth max recommended normal price creators create mix alpha beta content killing mobs gives exp dont lose stats gear moment go neighboring region unless got even works continent youre wont reccomend game unless like starting whenever go new biomedid fun hours playing game yes point activity many times repetitively realize youre getting small bonus restartingbut prefer alpha version game way killing mobs finding loot disappear moment go ocean biome try get island ocean boat youre using speed across ocean disappears instantly biome changewollay pixxie love games guys got know changes years didnt text alpha beta people care game listen us help us create game everyone loves cubelike rpg games game fall love withif game ever gets updated true anymore write updated review likely change recommendation version get giant update worth time even update months release felt time give game second chancesadly little changed since devs unforgivably silent regarding many issues gameit clear unexpected comeback wollay quick cashgrab going radar bottom line cube world poorly designed deeplyflawed game could fixed creators instead decided release halfbacked version promising project done itothers explained better would game disappointment moment make shorti bought alpha cube world back really happy alpha really enjoyable stable already confident wollay would able make version game even better futuresadly notwhile cubeworld improved many aspects years also mess many ways stripped away major mechanics many planned features missing seemingly abandonedi unhappy current state game lack character progression repetitive gameplay loop unbalanced difficulty name issues happy update review positive way development take better direction update years making removes everything fun original alphadont buy update downgrade superior alpha years ago exp skill trees exploration tools hangars ships etc taken away upon entering new region gear loses stats entering new regionthese three changes ruined game hope something changes future either mod update update dev started talking promising removed features return well promised features alpha days beginning review stay sake maintaining current position note review subject change promised future games promised content removed core game substantially changed worse since alpha old road map game deleted lot promising stuff want full list things social media showed heres reddit want original road map google developers policing image uploaded reddit game currently state cannot recommend region locking ruins whole experience forcing gear removed enter new area ever show region even region lock special gear helps transportation boat suddenly disappearing midway ocean astoundingly horrible design choice obviously tested game empty lifeless bland core leveling system removed true sense progression accomplished sure level finding relics provide minor movement boosts affect base stats except movement means characters progression locked gear thing lose entering new region combat skills still busted like mages laser shreds health anything current state game leaves little talk leave talk isnt good either promised update wollay said bringing back leveling system new skill tree promised races traits hes working dungeons big cities seems like game whole reworked though leave game negative review recommend game current state update think review changed positive update developers ran away money like years ago absolutely communication since release fiasco updates even deleted idea great stuff great current state pretty sad product missing tutorial ingame hints beta players dont expect anything different release day got killed rabbits cows hours day one devs explained look village get quests npcsquests quests nothing like proper quest system despite years long teasing system simply random events scattered around map doesnt matter get marked map npcs helps finding range killing mobs free npc simple basic things like simply finding place taking hang glider item doesnt help works pretty poorly doesnt give speed boost whole sense behind quests give player better equipment reward luckyleveling doesnt exist game least doesnt anymore thing developer sadly calls leveling without reason count artifacts find end dungeons artifacts give bonus movement speed swimming sailing riding etcafter finish region set travel nearby region starting almost zero except lucky enough find gear works neighbour regions upgrades got new adventure another region new pet companion movement upgrades artifacts general gear strictly region locked partly gets worse starting gear switch regions mechanic however sounds worse really weird first continue play realize almost visiting harder high level area games first time old gear interesting time could improved lot aspects point dont even keep boat glider instantly forget ride pet enter new regionthere almost none features teased past years release version skilltree levelsystem rename artifact level please level artifact count doesnt sense behind quest system also dont call got quest system random event thing reworked bare minimum could expect game otherwise pretty empty wide landscapes good also far enough dynamic experience motivation keep playing capital cities ocean regions got huge downgrade terrain oceans large empty enemies list goes ondespite kinda like game lot fun first hours day trying play mage without knowing pretty much feels like playing lot different zelda games right basically travelled hyrule hours trying finish quests dungeons first region still didnt know really made game stuff works started game twilight princess twice large region afterwards decided pause instead play game wind waker nearby ocean region really felt lot like playing wind waker sailing island island freeing region evil sorcerer unlock last dungeon region huge graveyard island fight challengers huge arena finally continue twilight princesslike adventurebut thats pretty much although currently quiet fun dont think anyone permanently fun game long term without getting disappointed bored one main aspects cube world back even year ago developer somehow suddenly removed everything worked always teased sporadically features fans alpha players ilovedi past months strangely decided give us instead neither anyone paid back anything dream vision developeryou try argue want fact developer wrote lists exactly passion project supposed games inspired planned dont work dream years without releasing anyone updating basic alpha decide oh know actually dream exactly basic starting point years ago restrictions without core mechanics already released worked lets release first let quickly downgrade terrain generation use level display artifact counter also know buying alpha way ifinancingi supporting development game exactly usual way ibuyingi game honestly makes even worse thats excuse money finance development formerly great projectexactly almost nothing actual end product see result today fact finished product meant saleso despite kinda liking played beta fun cant recommend game people except people two specific people exactthis started good turned bad years good inbetweens turn full offensive like bad prank last second people including still hoped beta joke partly built beta purpose testing terrain generation item system release important core mechanics official release turns intention punch everyone face right start personally didnt even play alpha couple minutes pc bad itat point isnt acceptable behavior anymorethe communication devs poor non existent people screaming answers everyday get nothing instead many almost randomly selected steam forums moderators abused system locked lots threads proper criticism new mechanics even ipositivei posts got locked straight deleted people tried bash developer negative comments provocation purposes thats happened feedback process beta one supposed help developer improve product fix bugshonestly development beta release cube world huge disappointmentcube world went surprise decade years development without updates except screenshots features never got released disappointment year regards gaming game huge development communication marketing financingdisasterit potential one best games

feel directly compared predecessor lackingalpha owners able directly compare two games immediately notice direct downgrade disappointed also hopeful game fun promise failed execution vastly inferior alpha build gearregion mechanic god awful cut features left right theres less game years agoit might worth future idea expect thought good direction head inthis feedback testing important keeps committing years changes everyone going hate cool many wows cute fun game music pleasant exploration enjoyable disappointed part alpha beta hoping things would changed release game progression mess

annoying good yes yes yes good great game like game possibilities travel world theres different biomes explore also find artifacts level character give better stats grindy prepared die lot still great game tho hollow shell game lacking core gameplay presents poor design decisions well cant polish turd one rolled nice glitter little changed since alpha years ago region based gear progression system feels bad seems like cash grab rerelease old game nice nice game nice game nice game repetitive gameplay poorly made amount time spent development disappointing played alpha hundred hours like

procedural terrain top notch truly reminiscent retro gaming cube world leverages modern pc capabilities render large dynamic worlds music core gameplay also among favourites time rhythm fights effects

lackingthis passion project husband wife amazing good considering people worked itdo buy think refund wait content comedo buy like voxel adventure games new slow progression type wow trash honestly im convinced dev money grabbing snake hes hes complete moron mechanics replaced old alpha version laughably terrible dont even understand could spent month developing without noticing let alone years

steam updated quite happy hear till played guttedthe gear based gameplay really weird functionality itevery time move different zone lose gear things like glider boat heres problem actually intended way supposedly reason developer took six years complete silence rebuild game around ridiculous function meanwhile adding enticing functions promisedheres crutchhes blamed mental health selling millions copies years ago steam came said stress caused mental problems im sure time almost hes trying make blameless take away criticismwell heres thing game crappy state right received littletono substantial updates years hes silent reupload steam also met silence im glad didnt purchase still recommend right everyone save cash something thats worth flatout nostalgia trip even version around six years ago aint around avoid moment waited years release getting alpha hoped would still pretty good fun waited years game finally came looked like content removed progression system items region locked shame really wanted good game cant praise game hard start cheese get lucky even able kill anything worth playing worth looking let die waited years game since alpha played hour sure tutorial handholding refunded game wait till game actually enjoyable also doesnt feel empty dont feel like game years worth updates know one two people worked honestly still dissappointing advice buy try

project enormous potential fiercely loyal fanbase already buried forgotten reason found game read review trust game isnt worth time money wasnt worth wait waited years gamestraightup good timewait progression general rebalance consider buying itotherwise meh difficulty based around instagibbed didnt grind enough waited years got really disappointed game kind rogulike instead rpg level progression skill tree skills unlocked start lose gear moving next regionoverall fun wollay promised waited years dev gave updates time scrapped delivered totally different game without even letting community know alpha way better betarelease game doesnt tell anything quests skills loot everything need discover google dev serious problems mental health development still cant trust delivered zero communication community even know waited years seems like downgrade really enjoyed alpha played death worseno skill trees removes incentive kill things wild even everything usually bumrush kill instantly regionlocked equipment huge letdown crossing region border stuff taken away id rather cross couple regions go mega dungeon obtain really good artifact instead one dungeonregion subpar artifactthe game doesnt even live alpha version fell love genuine shamehope wollay changes stuff cos isnt expected game waited years love tho could use work still really good waited long time excited rediscover game today waited age game finally update years road say im disappointed would understatement slowly fed updates twitter didnt even make game nice reddit writeup many didnt huge list fundamental progression game changed removal leveling dont get wrong still good progression game without leveling items terraria great example however game fails hilariously gear reduced basically power shift regions transportation items removed leaving walkswim slowly one shot enemies map game youre supposed want explore world freedom go want seriously curb stomped ambition right bat combat still poorly balanced years magic enemies still stun obliterate move undodgeable beam attacks reach highest tier gear region waltz around obliterating things occasionally still running odd enemyboss one shots clear developer idea balance game progression making end result slap face initially supported game bought voice opinion progress game got years silence rare leaks systems didnt ever make cut waited long download shit fun like seconds get hit die rat waited long game disappointing good enough free cos bought alpha waited review see anything really changed acknowledgedthe fun explorationbased game kinda ruined removal lot thingsno true progression makes game feel fresh play longer explore figure stuff outeven ui better old versionit feels like game massive shift focus middle development able give feedback developing maybe lot issues couldve avoidedalso wheres house building wollay wanted able build cool house like told us wed able waited years years really hoped would fulfill potential although bad game much shown cut good reason true disappointment waited years game come back find completely ruined everything good removed reason also less content started really wanted like game kinda unplayable content originally waiting game since alpha totally worth ot walking simulator region youll enjoy realize loop meaningless even gear makes game boringlets see wollay improve change thing else im playing bad scrapped alpha system chance checkoutthis game feels like girlfreind let another sleep ther apatment didnt tell yu anything later found things werent left new younger galps seems cheaterwollay still mia prolly kia walloy didnt listen feedback despite everyone unanimously agreeing artifacts needed buffedits fun hours realize even four artifacts riding cant pass thats small increase wanna love game like old times cant making open world game punish us exploring taking gear multiple times day isnt fun see idea fare sucks upgrade u level ridiculously bad last thing make legendaries actually rare want boat vanishes middle ocean entered new regionwant find gear tha rusts away entering new regionwant get one shoted slimeswaspscows entering new regionwant receive artifacts levels dont improve combat ability movement ability boat glider find every regionin general like stuff without anything feels like actual reward progressionwell game youin personal opinion game punishing exploring fell reward anything already felt repetetive pointless hoursthere good things looks music pets boat glider multiplayer lot fun still quite enough put problems minimap quite brilliant honestbut long dev doesnt fix games problems least fine tune gameplay loop fun rather go back playing cube world alpha wanted love game much harder leveling get lucky finding high rarity weapon class use half time end getting gear cant use opinion alpha way enjoyable im still holding onto hope wollay add levels back game make game enjoyable alpha want able reccomend game friends right people save money clear indication fixed wanted make game exploration ruined concept exploration adding region locked gear items bought alpha back always imagined would like complete cube world experience isnt huge fan alpha version bummer become pretty fun game little worse alpha still enjoyable bug decided let play anymore review mostly asking help boot game screen becomes white instantly crashes ive backed data uninstalled reinstalled game restarted steam several times nothing probably corrupted file would mean id restart hours progress alpha player remember game much fun although may little different base game compared played back day lot less bugfree good starting point updates come game right ive honestly much fun playing grinding friends im glad made multiplayer much easier set easily invite friend two clicks button although spawn absolutely miles away easily meet game using flight master nearest villagehowever something would like see better level ups mount riding speed lamp light range increases maybe upgrades weapons could carry zone zone even weapons could carry zone zone abilities skill trees would awesome time maybe even mechanics comes mobs fighting themdespite fact game could better future game damn good play ive really enjoyed far amazing game alpha regular update plan game could mastapiecee world currently fairly empty skills populate liven world randomness maybe check progression system maybe give player way change world well good luck awesome awesome fun first switch regions gear regionlocked artifacts arent worth grinding since upgrades provide trash overall enjoyable long run fun play little became boring quick good early alpha years ago turned shit worth pricetag good lasted guess still worth shot great alpha sucked brought beta released steam gameplayruining mechanics really hinder progress isnt much collecting items years ago still enjoy hyped let first hour gameplay boring refundedi really wanted like game cant worth year wait great longer still fun viewed singlestand alone game really fun ruined super excited game come without rpg elements alpha theres real sense progression restarting new region non combative passive exploring world interesting would worth restarting thinking get back game somehow game back first version instead improving last version recommending new updates comes get back stage suppose watch reviews browse subreddit buy game make sure something might enjoypersonally believe flawed ways one comparing alpha though may enjoy new systems implemented nevertheless game far cry completed gotta hope wollay actually fix underlying problems actually take experience purchase game grain salt watching paint dry fun costs less money way back supported alpha game ton fun playing beta full release ive much even sure may skill tree exp bar pet thirst dunno changes ive seen good ones far new stuff thats put questing better map locations zones separate equipment never stop improving good maybe well eventually see skill tree return besides dont think feel like anything missing even doesnt im happy weve got great work bringing us fun game time wollay knew version totally different alpha wollay said negative reviews pile love game wollay keep good work peace need cube world alpha steam far superior crap never got promised ages ago wanth xp system back game without xp system like pokemons without pokemons main part missing weapon based progression cool idea locking items single region could interesting although would hard make put two together pretty much get rid permanent progression game hope wollay comes back pulls mans sky game theres much showed last years arent game big cities pirates updated leveling system etc never made release current state youre hoping something akin alpha id say look somewhere else doesnt really hold wonder want time waster play listening podcasts something give shot guess game changed might change review current state cant recommend weeeeeeeeellmy english much controversy game fun short best friends partner start little tough come alpha dont expect start equally hard theres plenty bugs creators seems missing disappeared previously years dont expect improvement music great though nice filler current price much recommend beacuse nostalgia weird progression game pretty neat welcome cube world hope dont like exploring well alpha really good back day beta leaves much desired think new leveling system new unique levels dont mean anything game doesnt progression system stuff resets enter new area areas arent big theyre pretty small unless want run around chunks whole game experiencing town different mobs area youre going get benefit glider boat good weapons artifacts worse part boats glider disappear leave area warning like oceans count area like boats kind worthless game atm dont really know say wollay us first half gonna lie game good well mean werent art style wouldnt belive gamei mean combat system good wasand region system ughits laggy takes load render things compared grafics alpha lag less old pc skill tree like artifact idea less end game thingmaybe level system doesnt increase speed arifacts could increse attack hp similiar thingsit would okay new game developers sure want game didnt know make game fun players waited years worse experience well still fun playing pokemon pets doesnt worth euro well im never buying game fella worked ever againpart still hoping update game itll probably never happen well played cube world alpha exited forgot heard news coming disappointed reason old one great could go anywhere get better regions youre free understand wanted make feel diffrent wasnt worth wait well waited years release im statisfied endproducti mean yeah chill fun game relax play buddies problem cube world game mechanics first ther regionbound items features become totally useless like crafting upgrading gear doesnt rlly feel right run around totally useless items find legendary drop first min new regionthe second big problem cube world nearly progression whats ever go new region grind gear get useless artefekt repeatin conclusion fun becomes repetetive hours well sayi completely forgot cubeworld lack updates years ago moved thinking would never touched get email saying cubeworld released steam update excited download right away try alpha testers beta wow say years somehow managed make worse region locking gear bad idea makes feel like arent progressingnow people going say difference fighting stronger opponents becoming weaker fighting opponents well doesnt answer sentence alone let lay getting weaker progression makes character progressing might say well difference starting whole new character playing character progression dont say oh get artifacts along region locking gear also region locks movement abilities probably wouldnt mad gear thing movement wasnt region locked get boat mounting ability parasailing ability nuisance isnt fun especially since either randomly find randomly hope get quest shows opinion would better unlock first unlocked go one easy find obelisk reunlock movement found one dev roadmap im sure google find ease new promised features many alpha players hoping years honestly expecting bring gutted version alpha way looks like dev trying make another run peoples money disappearing another years reanouncing different platform get even money hopefully im wrong actually care community change game update accordingly like mans sky turned around became great gameto wrap one go region locking gear lazy way tiers gear make levels gear make reset would recommend game stands hope seeing reviews wollay change better progression system add features promised years ago well worth wait cube world intellectual move forward old one love change exploration based good mechanics round good game cant wait explore well first thanks continuing work game years appreciate even things players want moment like added game far mobs npcs fast travel system nice able play friends steam also nice vs someone host server see lot people happy leveling system region locking items said working team game easy dont lot people bounce ideas ideas seemed good time made see community likes dislikes improve upon like class changes agree exp brought back skill trees always add flare game like new spells abilities tank actually able tank new dungeons nice rouges snipers cant sneak way end get treasure understand though region lock good idea wouldnt much challenge grinding first biome legendary looted mind maybe could add increased difficulty increase level way keep difficulty dropping offall still like game excited see improvements make future thanks wollay well years expected dont think bad lot worse would say lot mechanics definitely feel like result one guy developing game bubble years understand lot people dont like time machine think would still buy game alpha well least pretty colors well since game coming tommorow since apart beta program feel inclined give review highly anticipated andor skeptical releasecube world wonderful blockyrpg game filled monsters quests basically infinitely sized world along infinite progressioni remember buying alpha went middle school im graduate high school understatement saying bought alpha waited little bit got brilliant taste game wait several years game reality different game thought wasthe alpha expbased progression current game switched ibp itembasedprogressionthis good badthe problem lot people associated exp cube world used alpha removing exp resulted completely different feeling game play also removed lot incentive kill random enemies rather hope rng give items even usehoweverthis progression potential quite great biggest concern work hard items less gets taken away leave region slightly faster glide speed longer diving time big problem cube world incentive real justified incentive progress one wants take hours complete one region able glide faster cant even immediatly glide switch regions immediatly weak beginning demoralizing results short oneanddone experienceif perhaps artifacts gave us satisfaction made us feel really improving would fun turn slaying enemies incentive navigated large regions would also fun engaging expierience maybe instead single piece gold maybe food could bigger item pool likescaled enemy ranklevelgold including buffsmaps unexplored dungeons villages region even treasurei think cube world would really benefit working game mechanics make sense provide incentivehowever truly brilliant game believe great potential think tons fun playing developers hard work feeling turn fantastic game entire community proud well begin destroyed exploring sense game cant really explore anymore leave biom youve grinded tried get good gear youll lose sense worth nothing lets say legendary sword one biom sword would like common lvl sword another dont get wrong love every aspect cube world fact everything made small little cubes sounds art characters crafting pets love everything still remain old cube world cube world alphasooo dont get game know good old cube world disappointed dont get game value memories old one least want keep nostalgic feeling thanks well would one expect years silence worth buy well hearing news hour wrote weeks late missed midnight beta release cube world coming alpha phase onto steam positively thrilled honestly jumping excited dumped countless hours alpha loved every minute read reviews read forums others thought immediately shot right disbelief feels people liking cube world possible even anticipation revival got steam key installed found first hand didnt even put much time although still cube world really cube world get games change creators different ideals creation might turn though scrap already amazing mix almost endless progression challenging skill based combat grandioso exploration make region bases grind ill never figure nothing goes new regions start skills unlocked dont earn xp traditionally rpg gear turns hot garbage eventually sell leave region start grind map fully revealed everybody longer procedurally generated world rts fow like reveal explore travel flight master anywhere map long gold quests new places explore actual game progress ill still playing always love game however every minute played kicking screaming garbo version cleaned replaced real cube world first put wolmeister well say different people saying ask game worth right hmmm plan play friends maybe yes playing friends disconnect things make game good enough either way id wait see future cube world maybe game itll change maybe enjoyable way game today well couple hours might get tired running around stuff anyway wait little buying ok wellthe different classes nice soon change region whole progress zero shame arent listening community well worth wait simple answer wasnt tip avoid game altogether welp game update best game ever played understand happened wollay lead scrapping whole design starting instead fixing bugs adding new features none matters though beta full release hopes still high game sure wollay pixxie initially come agreement community restore main part game way back thensupportlxtus went fun gun like years ago watered version today went great alpha huge potential shell alpha version bravo wollay look forward hearing years went great game trove somehow worse actual happened game every feature alpha people liked removed replaced systems make gameplay sense buy scam like game open world relaxing play cube world want play game walk runwhat dont like region lock boat one area suddenly gone another areaits also missing experience bar skill tree fun collect artifacts level upi hope developers bring back experience bar skill tree removce region lock future update cube world isnt fun like thisi advice buy cube world big year disappointmentthe devs almost couldnt picked directions take development would ruined game morei sure aiming less mmo grindy experience try stand way game stands unbelievably wrong gonethere absolutely zero progression acceptable fun losing things changing zones brainless idea could ever come seriously whythe version fun disappointment alpha excellent needed progress beta justdisappointing much else say fantastic wee big game garbage system game adventure punishes adventure treat buyer beware love game walk first zone realize garbage game letdown backed alpha better version developer choose commuicate anymore knows ever updateddont buy scam lol happened years happens truest used amazing game potential happened game past years games creator promising great things released thisif want hear whether game worth purchasing posting absolutely literally playing meaningless game nothing shiny loot drops good zone dropped motivationhowever cause game came recently may get much needed updates ill give two cents experienced far gamemy prosfor game based exploration pretty fast paced travelling around without mounts etc doesnt feel horrible movement feels smooth combat wastes time figure outcome quicklyalmost anything isnt considered humanoid giant tamed means tame simply grind treats figure pet likes treatswhile lacking compared back class based system gives meaningful variety like weapons deciding attack choice two subclasses determine movement options ultimate ability havemy consyou read everyone else youll read games relevant means progression gear based heavily rng reliant could take minutes find something amazing practically never find good weapon early rest zone becomes much joke dont think even kids enjoy itother means getting gear like buying crafting tied behind finding crafting books saving suppliers zoneboats mounts gliders convenient tied finding zone sadly makes hasslebosses feel like regular enemies healthzones really lacklusterloot travelling options key items crafting gear zoneboundzones smallyour actual means progression tied behind artifacts zonebound increase means get around zones slightly faster diminishing returns boottheres lot could point would rather wait month two giving depth review game release honestly better hasnt already said please make zoom inzoom somethingplease dont take away movement options like hangglider every regionplease make artifacts unique reward doesnt fit grindplease talk us wollay dont take negative criticism heart use better project done cube worldi dissapointed dont know went wrong thought game better lot things change even worsethe hud broken cant see everything trading using inventorythe combat unbalanced meet bee times stronger beggining seriousall legendary items skills stuff weird uncomfortable idea group ogres chilling forest next village well big strong kill player one hit spawning fast often villages poor maybe pumpkins corn fields flowers grass still feel like could houses empty find inside bed table chair wardrobe carpet flower sometimes npcs boring dont say anything interesting repeating favourite pet fire beetle well thats awesome mister say something else sometimesthe classes unbalanced example warrior much stronger archer water mage op class understand difference big combat game annoying sometimes mage meet group enemies impossible keep distance get anyway enemies fast stupid fight hard boring iti know things wrote beggining game thats point game better know things needs changed destroying gameplay look coins collecting system annoying tooalmost everything game bad unfinished im starting think wollay wife get money disappear forever wish wrong looks like im right considering fact responding againif like game understand like gives nostalgia love graphics music amazing atmosphere great still play probably really hope important things change future cube world thriveim really sad good thought would maybe future change rating really hope soyou shouldnt buy waste money good god thinking bro new players need understand alpha cube world progress alongside fleshed combat system means actually stood something need hope youre lucky enough either cheeseball higher level mob clear higherlevel chest find one hidden around areaand prepare potential render useless next area downgraded repeat process next extremely similar areaalphaheads would rather leveling crafting gear stand something alongside promised arealeveling systems teased twitter elsewhere system get doses yay gets oldmodding veloren dosince wol wont fuck used good steam like years ago manage nothing years fuck hell happened game point region locking system bad system goes game entirely remove system think game would lot better please please please bring back exp system things done could easily recommend game current state recommend staying far away game game needed beta alpha hat fell love available public different game promised different even hardcore fans trouble find motivation keep playing wollay needs release option play alpha rules much like runescape old school whats feeling demo years ago fun play full game oh ya disappointment cube world first came bought right away loved beta love even bought alpha supporting idea thought game potential hopeful idea would grow something truly great didnt happen impressive demo game never fully realized time move bought game alpha good time moved life wasnt mad wasnt counting days overall pleasant surprise see come backthe game current state certainly isnt everyone lacks lot depth long term nonetheless good time second time around believe game watch potential though repugnant infantile reaction much community might cause wollay ghost us wouldnt blame fair say cube world somewhat overpriced say im hoping future updates justify providing constructive criticism retrieved sea angry gamersothers pointed new levelling system leaves something desired due start gear whenever reach new zone particular find artifacts impactful considering theyre main persisting form progression throughout adventure really would expect something interesting eg glider speed player needs incentivised thoroughly explore zone however none changes alpha really worth throwing doritos pram fortaking beautiful relaxing game fairly easy pick playing friends makes better fun discover new things game mechanics exploration decent diversity customisation races subclasses weapons pets easily sink many hours game enjoy exploration sake got game alpha rough could see good game burried could amazing years later feels like minimal progress made anything design decisions moved bad direction really hope turns something good theres lot interesting ideas unpolished initially bought cube world alpha quickly realized essentially playing tech demo decided shelf wait got update fast forward six years game still doesnt feel less like tech demo fact feels imorei like one current state cannot recommend cube world graphics nice unique overall game design appear well thought time waited game reach full release many masterpieces created legend zelda breath wild slay spire like open world games friends wanna kill time id say go though theres

around map like botw treasure spirit opinion great idea spirit helps make travelling location location much enjoyable scratching surface comes shit world would like added cause fuck might like game beginning bad job explaining get discouraged figure game blast similar minecraft idea fuck would hate throws world context survive well thats exactly case cube world please give game chance might enjoy even missing lot standard conventions present mmos would also recommend playing many friends cross boarder feel like northkorean go wrong used much fun trash progression antifun mechanics even begin whole situation bloody messas writing review game released alpha backers playing game weekthis game going years without update respectful towards backers developer suffered lot pirating attack extremely violent comments initial launch back go details clearly shows severely hurt soon psychologist see impact violence people devastating especially perfectionnist personnalities led wollay redo huge portion game doubti one enjoy game mechanics find really frustrating especially lack significant long term goals appreciate removal xp level bound gear enjoy gameplay enemies locations feeling adventurethe development history game could definition unfair hype game disappeared finally back whole years later people went crazy expectations unrealistic granted current version game feels like things removed thus experience lessened far know thats expected alphas betasyou may like game may wish hope receives updates sure way developping game pretty bad humble opinion communication would gone looong waybut please remember human poured heart game maybe think much demanded keep going personal attacksit excuse bad practices removal negative posts forums instanceof course review game negatively absolute right thats want hope little review help judge things bit clearly anything fun part begin happened gamethis monstersized disappointment especially compared alpha skill tree remove level system game feels even emptier years ago alot features made game super fun gone hope fix start someone bought alpha game years ago waiting time cube world release happy say product worth adventure rpgs charm offer beautiful world play though isnt game offers enough progression play consistently years bright side however could minor tweaks think come game time bottom line opinion contemplating buying game pay enjoy hours current state bit hope progression tweaked way makes game hour experience rather hour one absolutely fun hours played game ill agree majority prerelease gamer region locked equip right way keep us entertained long makes feel like whole progress made absolutely nothing goes changing regions though youre playing area really feel progress find good equip point take boss like mobs without getting stomped hitthe game needs changes agree wholeheartedly recommend game hope much fun playing c understand people upset things turned still think game good however hope doesnt discourage wollay improving game addressing everyones concerns maybe im looking rose tinted glasses game always special place heart honestly feel fixedimproved simple changes may exactly hoping still enjoy game nonetheless recommend game think needs improve bit one improvement would reinstatement leveling system thoroughly enjoyed cubeworld past still much odds region lock relics found actually gave meaningful stat boosts think region locking would felt satisfying comes earning upgrades big change alpha game still brilliant new game blast played alpha consider completely new game blast good time killer cube world downgrade alpha many feels like waited long game could much clearly need improvements fun exploring growing understand kind direction wollay intended idea regionlocked gear effectively makes efforts nil im upset loss skill tree like idea artifacts effects amount effects could gained adjusted better sense permanent progressionif willing put issues aside suggest getting game different alpha game still plenty life hopefully updates future long live wolay understand someones issues region locked equipment find works well multiplayer everyone strength regardless many areas theyve cleared though movement speeds may differ leading entertaining situations also makes taking long break playing easier go new area continue never left shaking rust may varynot mention cant think many rpgs progression soley equipment based personally find quite refreshing flaws enjoyable game would recommend like pixel stylepersonal opinion like youre able play lizardman think pretty neat certainly different alpha expected game play ive enjoying quite bit nice play friends feel like youre level entering different region changed lot since alpha still like fun awhile first region get legendary gear complete region dosent take long hours less find legendary gear early isnt much else going another region restarts unless got gear region next takes hours upon hours grinding things region even days two grinding usually get green blue purple gear rarely one legendary gear even getting artifact even somehow main gear completely keep full strength neighboring region everything every region pretty much grass plains generic enemies dungeons quests get boat glider reins etc quickly becomes repetitiveif made crafted gear gear made gear region become gear mains artifact dungeons completed make grind go next region restarting complete beginning less grindy worth get new region isnt muchthat simply enable people able mod game let people make want reviews claims game unfortunately true still lot fun exploring beautiful landscape simple combat held quite would say still worth pickup least case study horizontal progression done almost right design choices questionable worth wait creator understandably gone dark due massive somewhat ignorant response many within existing fanbase modding community saving grace objectively game fun experience one exploration games actually enjoyed issues game lie three particular enough ingame assistance descriptions skills access classes choose etc many ui elements going menus crafting objects npc markers woefully unintuitive however difficult fix creator game continues work confidence eventually remedied also suggestion mr wollay npc important information give marker head said need say make marker disappear attempting talk variety uniquely named npcs spread town knowing whether got information available quite boring little anxietyprovoking regionlocking transport itemsi understand regionlocking bell flute harp act milestones completion region obtaining boat heading ocean region immediately lose boat awkwardly swim hours find another one fun player reason dont see games getting rid playerunlocked tools abilities imagine frustrating would play hollow knight hours suddenly lose dash ability method movement made player feel like progressing stripped away reason feel crippled frustrated gear regionlocked something understand like unique mechanic primary reason frustrated many people different alpha progression mean bad assure never play another game progression like cube world proposed fix vehicle problem spread multiple regions unlock permanently boat available first ocean region player enters glider available starting region climbing shoes available first snow region gives players incentive keep exploring even reset gear significantly longterm artefacts weakit takes many hours complete region permanent buffs receive reward insignificant mention half potential buffs get proven actually work current state game reward completing region feels like afterthought understand small bonus supposed incentivise longer investment game sheer amount time takes players reach point notice bonuses far long however one quickest fixes community honestly surprising gotta increase swim speed buff per artefact game breaking gives player sense noticeable improvement recommended fix make artefacts give stronger boosts make feel worthwhile explore regions also make artefacts bit valuable worth searching could make trade artefacts make item unaffected region locking provided regions move completed already way areas completed feel interconnected motivation players increase size territory powerful absolutely believe three relatively simple changes implemented reviews game would become mostly positive positive reader braved entire wall text thank would recommend hopping onto cube world reddit nexus mods getting cube world mod loader experiment different mods fix issues ive talked bought game openmind see potential fantastic memorable game changes could rolled months whether buy wait reaches point would pull trigger experience game despite negatives ive discussed game fun exploration great sound track unique interesting enemies great art world generation fun combatmy rating right changes implemented rating goes tips included game also take note potential buyers find town near spawn point talk npcs tell specific location item enemy marked map traversing completing quests progress start strong enough kill even weakest enemies primary goal explore search itemslocations staying hell away groups enemies spawn enemies give exp theres reason try grind start find couple pieces star gear start take star enemies small groups quests able clutch way better rewards stronger become change subclass guild master town change abilities eg rogue subclasses assassin ninja ninja focused speed assassin stealthremember kind guys remember game developed single person years slammed upon release show sympathy bur remember doesnt excuse criticism love game unconventionnal exp mechanism region locking know play actually quite satisfying complete every region finding methods get good gear fast rolling around get legendary weapon fair amount content musics simple nice wouldnt recommend youre hardcore fan old grinding level killing mobs system overall ill recommend would like try another way play rpg game isnt exactly everyone wanted release think still fun game would recommend friend gameplay combat feel clean youre game think would like reach peak cube world gameplay may wanna get mods reach exp idea game used progression system kinda wacc antiplayer game charming joy sink hours every despite problems exist still would highly suggest carefree fun game solid gameplay excluding things lot things nothing adds make feel like accomplished anything items reset region theres really overall goal game fun friends still relatively meaningless gameplay fun somewhat engaging several glitches online play interfere battles sometimes even singleplayer glitchy theres angry mob review bombing game paid product change view years ago knew nothing game maybe week launch say like pretty great isif youre looking game something know nothing well heres generally expect listdifficult fightszonespecific loot means always something never become god seemingly endless worldcrafting upgrade system optionaltaming petsmountslistif want game youre always able foot friend lot friends cant play time travel zone match gear level mine reset go definitely worth look like kind endless roguelikeexploration type game receiving lot negative reviews personally like game still one got game years ago much different dont think goodin regards still enjoy think negative reviews came people expecting alpha still think alpha regards better still think version perks much easier opinion get going first spawn one thing would like see changed though region locking gear done attempt make progression system would start new region see coming trying dont think right dont know solve without getting rid intention although still think try find way remove good dame couple flaws game wont everyones cup tea certainly isnt bad game ive found much enjoyment since accepting isnt exactly wanted enjoying youre fan roguelites youre going enjoy classic rpg fan zone essentially treated new game new run minimal arching progressionnew players hard time dont read guide difficult game understand color code system ranks powerqualitydifficulty enemies quests gear blue gear fight blue enemies blue quests doesnt help spawn gray gear even white enemies tough startthe art style lot carry game seeing creature explode pixels never gets old pets quite cute fun collect music good would like see sound tracks tracks become repetitivethe combat addicting personally feel combat felt smooth skill based alpha release feels gear matters skill still enough depth rate combat acceptable watching listening bosses use major abilities dodge common mechanic always seems make combat feel rewarding always exciting get stun water mage bit overpowered healing stream maybe made ultimatethe progression system hardest pill swallow game like said system reminds roguelite style game progress obtaining artifacts increase movement speeds gear plus mark end especially blue higher quality really valuable getting legendary plus weapon easily help carry though many zones gold also valuable type progression since saving suppliers easy way obtain lot gear zone strongest point game alpha current game exploration aspect feel ability zoom map somewhat takes away current game find exploring map screen mark locations instead traveling zone still run interesting things travel band npcs might tell new quest boss right level might drop upgrade may hear many people belittling game alpha dont let dishearten cube world amazing game still long way go gladly support whilst game definitely going get negitive reviews sould lookingat game unfinished beata six years agothis good game wanted still got game hope updates fix game loveable standardbut would call game investment im quite shure moding thingbut heard rumors lets hope get mods fix disliked thingsfor f makes amazing game decides showing everybody game goes dormant years decides completely destroy original game writing positive review may ask dont support wollay anymore anything hes jackass leaving us reason im writing positive recommending game future modders modders cube world hopefully going fix wollays disaster making game like alpha hopefully add new mechanics id wait weeks either comes hiding modders gonna fix game game potential bad game theres many features need rework content added keep faith modders make cube world great change gameconcept much take high risk insecure dont reply anything whole years alpha fine fun play new progression system trash satisfying basically restart game every time enter new biome idea skilltree thing pretty much everybody appreciates every mmorpg remove essential part game dont get make choices individualize character pathetic game game still lagging recommended specs still frames render distance feel scammed play game progress doesnt matterhope dont like exploration traveling everything reset trash moment leave zone got also lose nice tools like boat hanggliderso want see another zone make new character practically thingi wasnt lucky enough money years ago buy waited long time play couldnt disappointed tried god hope game goes back previous glory hold flicker hope wanted alpha exactly content restrictions pseudoinnovative stuff exactly loved much winrar better purchase wish game didnt region lock wish reason explore wish loot matteredits alpha wasim mad maybe listen community help make game everyone wants wish leveling system like earlier version still good game play wish like good game buy sale witcher far best game ive ever played geralt rivia favourite character medium wont go details game rpg fan play story excellent characters excellent atmosphere excellent world excellentalso cube world pretty crap dont play game play witcher instead group friends trying classes could probably get upwards hours rpg exploration fun gamethe game innovative approach progression wont keep everybody entertained forever game well worth price negativity flowing around stopped getting game made feel game horrible time game went sale decided pick actually alot fun feeling exploring finding new ares lore different quests combat isnt bad seeing xp system got removed still great game feeling getting good loot random structures rewarding worst part game starting get past segment game gets alot better would recommend game people want nice relaxing time mods pretty good game mods game fun mainly removing region lock bs super difficult start get decent item becomes touch doable game world lot fun always feels like new places explore mods game decent put lots effort hype game wont let like go without fight alpha received free felt unplayable originally without mods first world hoping mods save update year gap couldnt speak player base see would enjoyed changes game put simply gameplay super unfun repetitive playstyle reward reason many sales relied massive amount hype get day one sales many people didnt refund hours play time get thought would get better region locking badwithout region locking absolutely god like wanna game amount gameplay played wanna say enjoyable learned new system works obvious flawsi like idea challenging new area arent steamrolling backtracking worry friends levels gear compared areas however gear system works could improved adding degrading system instead outright making gear useless upon leaving gears intended area would make system far tolerablei also like idea end goal area get artifacts give character permanent stat increase long term progression however also another flaw fact increases stats glider speed mount speed light radius etc make tempting go long term progression actual stats combat would also much better execution ideathe gameplay pretty much feels alright though enemies could use scaling tweaks balances make fair player combat learned enjoyable others may like itthe visuals really nice look nice colorful voxel styled game makes exploring around appealing experience compared open world gameslastly something felt add playing solo experience get repetitive sooner rather later played least one friend made game feel lot fun less grindy could say lot games get legit felt like much enjoyable buddy playing alongso overall decent big flaws could improved wanted continue system neat looking game lot better playing others games current system location locked gear makes impossible feel like anything matters youll spend hours zone unlock full set legendary get two artifacts maybe head new zone effectively make new character classes play exact min played hours slight variation coming weapon choice game opportunity something good progression system gets reworked isnt worth money even gets reworked youre still looking game arguably worse alpha mod removes region lock feel confident toil wont erased nice time waster good exploration game recent news future update addressing concerns im hopeful game sort like mans sky recommend sale since still get decent fun current version current long gameoldwith complete stop communication dont see potential fixes updates future game feels incomplete still fun really want wait big enough saleold reviewa game needs time get use toit certainly different alpha still lot funeven though lack overall progression besides artefacts bit sadbut yes still lot bugs balance things need fixedits rough still lot potential opinion get eventually years rewrites wasnt enough guesssolo multiplayer matterrip horizontal progression without purchasing mods game seems like hours long get awesome gear beat area move new area restart basically new player small boost exploration stats chance find gear bring slight stat increases new area lose much want continuing play mods make game fun wolfram von funckmore like wolfram von fuck content wolfram von funck great dev dont get wrong hard time communication community game alpha masterpiece changed form progression quite frankly sucks hope continues updates game people like dont abandon game playing due lack progression wollay needs change progression system gaining xp bought game day came absolutely loved despite flaws bugs reworked beautifully minus way regions work character items become absolutely useless regions quite honestly play thing every hours depending fast grind region need skill trees back need xp mobs back need actually progression enemies
