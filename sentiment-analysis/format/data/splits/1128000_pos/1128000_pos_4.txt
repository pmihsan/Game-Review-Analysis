pretty sure development team two people ffsi believe good run therei still get chills hearing music load game ill play alpha every oftenits bad game people expected bought game back first released standalone appreciate released new update assumed game entirely dead unfortunately game still plays though alpha developer chose completely change gameplay system feel actually made game worse always feel like new player arent progressing ive heard good things mods tried honestly hard little room improvement bought game back alpha available picroma site whatnot alpha fun good time exploring overall mechanics simply done maybe hours didnt friends wanted play thankfully isnt alpha great beta personallythe first treasure seeking hours almost bliss discover area youre lore game spawn points point cursor click teleport bunch neat utility equipment game lets whatever kind accomplishment decided go hop lava volcano top swam ocean little bit killed billion angry dogs whatever get essential zeldaesque utilitynow might asking hey next doesnt seem like im missing anything special equipment keys whats next yellow named area seems peculiar area might get artifact boosts one utilities minuscule margin would something truly complain thats next point game leaving area youre inyou might noticed kind drops symbol next region names saw stats nothing different rarity thus held value hope held onto kind region adjacent prove pieces equipment useful powerful equipment worth next nothing region aside origin well equipment useless utility area must sought thing truly get keep artifacts bonusesthis switch flipped people berserk mode tables got flipped go hours gameplay rinkydinky artifact near nothing progress scale downward whole idea would much better adventure game areas scaled difficulty gear scaled away origin nondrastic fashion artifacts didnt give stats didnt actually help characterthe way progress formulaic best find town map buy best gear repeat quests port far enough away get desired amount loot get better loot difficult quest artifact quest rinse repeatim angry game turned way im sad less passion project blunder mess someone seemed like stopped caring fun bought game ive bought loved original since start far nothing like original generally terrible bought game early alpha build playing years ive seen grow alot time yes game needing work small dev team im constantly impressed ive loved game start highly recommend people stick beta changed built fixed things feels like incredible step right direction personally cannot stop recommending game got alot potential bought game years ago loved gotten worth game time alpha definitely got beta love beta love way wollay taken game purely exploration aspect landscapes beautiful abundance mobs npcs fantastic combat system wonderful alpha course im like others would like limitations altered slightly time change improvementscube world one favorites since came even latest rendition think largest issue able go kill mob right gate like alphathe game definitely takes time get used alphamode many years leaving first biome plains hours game time youre patient willing learn take slow perfect game youcube world definitely worth eyes new old players like said plenty time improvement change although dont see needing much bought game alpha love art style combat simple still challenging good game could get hours playtime enjoy however developer extremely unreliable explained due harassment made mental health worse went awol years receiving level harassment looks like disappeared im doubtful even bug fixes near futurei enjoy game however cannot recommend wollay active stops running situation actually communicates people care game tldrgame roughly hours content cannot recommend whilst developer silent seems disappearing bought game like years ago alpha beta versions quite different game still lot potential neutral option yesno recommendation thats would bepros character creation still done well though options though future many classes choose try spec swapped town glidersmounts make getting around easier lots pets tamecons many features teased years game regional lock equipment fine dont like stuff like hang glider etc gets removed id rather get nerfed picking new region makes better somehow less stamina usage glider perhaps way tell npcs talked spamming town find last quest pain friends list isnt sorted lot friends pain find one want joininvite bought game originally loved still love nowupdate honeymoon wore im sad pine better version game near daily wollay come back us bought game six years ago alpha six years enough time wellfleshed fantastic game come rightwrong get pleasure exploring vast empty worlds nothing interesting seedo game twinkie video games interesting ultimately devoid substance youd fun playing tictactoe least theres variety bought game way back alpha good old timesnow broken shell former selfthe addicting gameplay loop made game fully removed replaced cuckolds tale progressi happily continue playing alpha bought game way back came alpha reason dont preorder buy many early access games cool ideas game unfinished dev mia certainly worth state dont expect updates bought game tiny released boring sense progression ripped hands due region locked gear nice due fact people basically made game pee pee poo poo seriously though tf though region locked gear good idea bought game first came loved steam im feeling ill itthe alpha better needs updatethe combat okay rewards skillthe relic system great rewarding way useless skillsthe loot system bad since progression first region completedall items get start feel lame never get keep outside region got intalking npcs fun first giving information region showing locations core region items dungeons begins get tedious quickly thought work temporary region youre makes feel uselessgathering relics levels levels dont mean anything long run higher level means wasted time useless thingsmage broken melee bad enemy mages hardest fight quickly devour health youre melee cant fight dodging doesnt help majority time gets killed fast unless youre anything stealth abilities melee enemy pushover unless melee welltowns cool useless youre going region short timeif want fun choose big region lots things stay eternity would fun start anew another region every great youre basically starting new game every region enter ehh wont tell play game thoughthe game okay pointless game ive ever seen state right games could compare alpha fun kept playing hours actually got better items whent got keep region regionthere mechanics didnt touch end shallowdont buy updated bought game first released basically everything went darki visited everywhere done everything wish never bought itwish creator would keep bringing game back nothing come bought game alpha back day say great confidence alpha way better like concept treasure hunter hunting artifacts leveling system least entirely dont like equipment region locked miss simple skill tree alpha made leveling feel rewarding want play game wait months gets updated wollay might fix game sees bad reception bought game years ago put hours heard getting update sprung sorely disappointed dev effectively mia little communication number years guess shouldnt surprised update hot mess sure annoyed worth money find alpha version want know game like bought game years ago alpha showed lots promise years silence developers excited heard something finally happening cube world unfortunately longer game paid game mechanics totally overhauled making game far less enjoyable removing sense accomplishment known direction game going go would never paid simply give game positive review current form wish developers would revert game alpha start wanted rpg thought paying dont know enjoyable bought game years ago super excited play hes really done anything years definitely feel like another money grab hes gone silent bought unfinished game five years ago co op fun friends didnt imagine tech demo would see light day steam bit polished state game back difficult recommend others playing game solo certainly wouldnt buy full price todayi would recommend getting sale fun mess around friends totally boring bought sale alpha period addition quests flight paths thing positive added negatives still remain spawn near enemies times health double damage find gear quests often rather far requiring long walk said overpowered mobs gank causing respawn away quest making walk longer hope game gets better also hoping would get better years sorry wolly least take solace fact didnt wait years play game like people game fun say alpha much fun betabeing shotted every mob visible region fungearlocked progression funlosing gear switching region fun recommend cube world current statethe region lock system really solution want play game blocks hinders much logical expansion game almost seems like joke alpha near perfect still great base expand upon easily excusable alphas meant expanded upon current version game go peon god literally one item drop rng reflects progression rate like region lock system invented could become incredibly op impossible alpha bar shitting cows non cyan dungeons level walk steps right brought back pleb status balance permanent combat upgrades would make problem worse point self would feel useless hit certain percentage would unceremoniously become god literally anywhereit also seems past years combat worked enemies run predictable manner sure different skins effectively like fighting mob others projectile based spittersnout beetlearchermage beaten simply walking left except mages dodgeable mages ring mages combat boring literally useless kill world quests drop better items enemies even fill barthere long term goals unless want increase light radius forever asking much actually actual progression mobile game nibble experience slowly work fully featured skill tree going spawn encountering different biomes harder smarter enemies maybe actual reason grind long term goal take bosseslords requires use brain beat instead using hit kite tactic require iq executethere much things wrong could effectively go forever might update later recommend game current state good idea going extremely bare bones doesnt replayability justify purchasing yet major flaws core progression game creator refuses acknowledge even communicate maybe another years game worth buying right nowlook game called veloren much potential game still enjoy game region locking new progression system also understand people dont like since feels unnatural still good game however maybe could bettersidenote soundtrack really nice still remember kind enjoying game years ago years late still game worse really sure dev managed kinda trash ngl understand design decision reset weapons armor understand design decision seeds rather one preset giant map based one seedi dont understand removing levels experiencei dont understand removing skill tree favor current skill systemi dont understand removing basically types cube usage pixelarting weaponi dont understand removal utility items supposed capital supposed procedural supposed faction leaders faction interactions faction gear years waiting game completely different promised even back twitter updates etcthe worst part fact cant even play game properly since towns dungeons framerate tanks legitimately computer runs starcraft ultra perfectly fine cube world tanks fps singledigit reallyeven taking consideration plea emotions depression etc wollay pixxie go fullon radio silence pretty clearly exit recommend game current state maybe created modding tools somethinga shame since part backers way back cant accurately recall many hours ive played game long ago bought even though loved way back still felt thought missing much even though lot changed release game still feel like taken change better progression experience wisepros things really enjoy cube worldtowns feel alive npcs give directions certain landmarks region give questsi like world consistent seamless friends join progression per character never need start go friends instance places visited always marked completedin older builds game feel like progression getting better gear leveling far slow understand gear per area still feel like im able get something done recent buildi like time passes dont recall older builds game time scaleplaying friends makes game infinitely entertaining specializations fore class makes things feel little unique far game play styles go even depending weapons friends pickthe map always visible even havent place however places havent learned marked map also use map locate areas youve already making easy find places youve youve fast traveled friend far away startedeven though start scratch new regions fun especially friendsive noticed game seems biomes something dont think existed older builds game years ago havent yet really enjoy happy see far game come excited see planned futureconsmisc game perfect things dislike games enjoy arent things definitely think need fixing per se however feel mentioneddespite said progression feeling faster find new gear use make new region game effects gear doesnt transfer per area unless name gear brought outside area full stats neighboring regions annoying time one youre playing equal ground areas havent previously explored artifacts give small boost becoming stronger overall take time overall feel like could worth iti feel like game balance issues far ai go mages feel especially powered cases almost didnt aim hit beam fire especially devastating travels point b instant said classes like rangers opposing mages dispose almost fairly warriors rogues may disadvantage due short rangeequipment crafting doesnt really seem like viable way obtaining gear since crafting materials arent common also crafted gear like gear useless outside region crafted better find buy equipmentfinding items like boat hang glider new areas little annoying youve grown used using mostly traveling significantly easier themthere ton races character creation options id love see available players usewith said really want people consider giving game chance ive noticed getting lot hate people barely spend time playing write review saying shouldnt spend money copy friend game ask theyll let try arent certain buying yet feel like lot offer even flaws like said game perfect cant join game say could initialize already everything fix finally cant tell fix get rate good cant level pets anymore happened ocean biome ware lots enemies cool bosses ocean feels like big empty blue crater nothing hell happened progression system fun intriguing explore new biomes find new bosses level beat even super strong enemies punishes exploring outside starter area thought good idea disappointment anyone even little touched alpha cant love game anymorewhen first played earlier version

wollay hope youre shut game flopped cant recommend game right many bugs many changes like bad region locks removing xp gain skill tree whats point even mention many bugs lag spikes friends countless internet problems occurred like sudden fog walls invincible enemies forced disconnections overall much happened much changed became one big sshhiittstorm hope fix broken game actually deliver promises review cant recommend game based dramatic changes gone seemingly removed lot existing planned content willing change review gets better though cant recommend game anyone likes rpgs drastic changes made core gameplay loop cant recommend game current state progression boring artifacts repetitive grind lead rather stale game play enjoy first area immensely maybe second come point get sick thing virtually gain imagine clearing dungeon getting shot mage bosses way open artifact chest lantern light thanks wont keeping eye cube world updated change review figure way make fun engaging cant recommend gamethe region locking mechanic slow start hour two running around hoping find piece equipment allows actually something make game excruciatingly boring swap regions againits tedious boring insanely grindy mention long term rewards get useless since stuff goes towards gets taken away region anywaysmodders hope game developers gone ghost havent given updates since launch cant recommend current statethere may content overall concept game changed much isnt recognizable anymoreand isnt fun anymore long run cant say much hasnt said already since early alpha days filled great promise amazing systemsafter thinking little bit yes way progression works resetting upon zone entry make marvel play multiplayer dont worry leagues ahead friends things oneshotted fumbles aboutbutthat could easily done multiplayeronly world scaling together something feelsanticlimaticid type lot people already done new thing say hope wolay maybe relax much toil may everyone wanted consider finished mind find break please wolay plenty lessons learned theres kinda nothing better move point cant understand people defending game incredibly boring wouldnt play freeeven people claim like dont weeks playtimein addition development awful barely additions game alpha years ago additions worseits bad im waiting dev announce joke real version coming soon cannot recommend due fact dev took years release game almost step back alpha go radio silent get kind communication ill likely change review dont see game improving cannot recommend game current state like refined alpha teased back january wouldve probably different opinion cannot recommend game alljust fact equipment region locked enough much worseafter years screenshots wollay posted showing features implemented dont existthe things promised alphas roadmap nowhere seen cant forget removed xp skillsthe universal progression system game artifacts overall miniscule combat boosts diminishing returns dont make impact allits less game alpha version cannot recommend game current state much changed removed alpha different isnt necessarily bad feel finished core gameplay loop fun region based equipment feels half baked losing travel items especially feels bad top removal many promised planned features kind makes feel like wasnt intended version instead got id keep eye see anything happens post release still potential could next mans sky cannot recommend game early alpha adopter patiently let wollay take time im baffled almost ways less game alpha things promised halcyon days nowhere found features many us looking forward included state game launch laughable im sure people enjoy game bought died somewhere along way hope game gets post launch content perhaps complete reenvisioning strong doubts cube world nothing would make happier come back change review game become promised instead suddenly became cannot say like changes made game played alpha game still pretty charming maybe get get run five frames per second worked fine minutes frame rate tanked reasons hope find fix computer powerful enough run itdidnt get play much maybe issues game fixed modders cant describe amount disappointment feelcube world one favorite games cube world anymore sure worth moneytime dont buy noti cant believe waited years instead fun open world rpg received hard boring pointless repetitive experiencesorry truth cant recommend game state im sorry waited years cant write name characters cant play paid euros game thought good six years ago cant even play game like b r u h wait ive played league legends years amount shit theyve put cannot even comperehend completed zone thought venture onto ocean see find seconds setting sail boat magically vanished region locked exploration gearafter waiting years release game im gonna go back play alpha couldve maybe overlooked gear changes taking away boats gliders etc changing zones takes away fundamental aspect game cant say changes made encourage exploring take away tools exploring current progression system turns every zone checklist makes feel like starting new game everytime leave zone essentially progression think progression system attempt hide fact actually still content game around hours youll experienced everything game offer think definitely worth get sale around maybe consider wait content added decided change thoughts game giving much time actually trying multiple times going new biomeszones clearing much work time rewards get stats get complete dungeon minute worth getting takes hours complete one biomezone state game currently recommend getting game first hours fun complete first dungeon back square one gear worked hard useless new biomezone wait see creators change game see mod game future really need say negative nancies roomthis rpg play different commonly used people complaining locked region gear however actually explore notice adventuring regions bad people think beafter playing new version game tips guys think choretalk every npc biggest help gamei would recommend trying explore ocean regions first objectives towns islands annoying thing find boat get smooth sailing pun intendedpeople also complaining exp exp gain different yes different played alpha still tried bad unlock artifacts fight inside castles regionbiome defeat boss inside rewarded stat boost either swimming climbing pet speed torch range etcthis game makes explore lot done go new biome mark everything map doesnt look normal middle mouse button example strange circle formation stones mark map white dark looking mini houses mark lava pool inside frozen biome mark anything see normal looking map mark likely something importantyou need give game time making judgements decided wait long write review wanted wait give developers chance something truth told fun time cube world liked whole artifact thing core gameplay fun enough however even like get boring really fast especially hearing exact sounds music adnosium think thing game really needed patches kind work done perhaps new region maybe option go back old progression players liked etc instead seems happened devs totally disapeared hope still working maybe planning big patch like mans skys developers vanished think waited long enough put two cents right game fells yet abandoned know comunity puts lot pressure devs behavior vanishing reason returning years game built much resentment game updated seemed like picroma actually gave shit would whole heartedly recommend hell remove review day something happens though conclude would recommend game sheer fact developers ridiclious belief acceptable totally vanish reason danm time enjoy gamei never got play much alpha due overall bad open world exploration rpgs back went game unexpecting mindsetthe game becomes repetetive maybe hours everytime enter new region lose boat glider climbing spikes reins even gear gets reset starting back square one mention every zone seems even things available themthe game lacks simple things saving progress lore discover ability descriptions non existantthere lot needed id call even close enjoyable exploraition experience grind every zone play alpha game maybe thats like pretty chill grindy adventure game play friends brutal start learn systems place master regionthen much want region new adventurehonestly polarizing title lot history ive known cube world month really dig price right youve following cube world years seems like youre expecting perfection youre letdown play alpha back day developer went radio silent save tweet two every year hadnt followed development game closely release surprise one thought welcome character creation hours ive played game time writing cannot im sure recommend game current state youre thrust world seems almost required speak every single friendly npc tutorial get help youre dropped world basic gear near town left devices longer possible use skill defeat harder enemies gear level handle one shot gameplay loop talking npcs beating enemies grinding loot beating quest areas level youre geared enough dungeons containing artifacts increase movement speed tiny increments compelling feels almost pointless reach neighboring region gear completely useless special items boat glider unusable find progression reset aside tiny boost movement speed artifacts new regions lot easier play friends multiplayer theres issues since everyone spawns far away everyone aside host end star gear everyone flies via flight master dont know game progress even updated big patches hope improves game recommend friends play alpha back came enjoyed serious flaws game felt alive variedmy issue current version isnt really gear lack leveling etc rather fact game world seems much emptier barren used power mobs seemingly randomized example would chicken star solo start game star crab cant avalanche issues map generation like campfires spawning bottom ocean star mob packs spawning top npcs essential progression didnt expect game released like dont recommend didnt play alpha version cant say anything game compared current version honestly great exploration action rpg usually overlapping genres experience point progression action progresses exploration longer either challenge rewarding cube world avoids problem softregion locking progression exploration done region still helps regions knowledge artifacts isnt region locked artifact buffs start make improved quality life rewarding feeling going love able encounter higher level enemies im geared evaluating like explorer whether fight possible whether worth moment even start area completely surrounded enemies cant deal flight master completely visible map make always scout new regions im even hang glide spots likely combatfree events like chests top hill try start bit gear therealso playing friends incredibly easy everyone massive map spawned different areas inviting people seamless fast traveling onto eachother easy classes compliment eachother items shared without ever worry buddy leveled dungeon advicescout map ahead time using mouse button place stars map zoom scan around looks like unnatural event plan youre routes finding town flight master near shrine goal love sweeping new areas themuse flight master often free travel friends one nice thing flight spots purchase gold one time purchases use often want afterwardstart island ocean areas youre trouble land use flight master island hop youve found boatlastly im usually complete perfectionist rpg exploration games wanting find everything im finding game fun taking taking pace great friends someone whos area probably tons spare gear joining already started problem didnt played alpha watched videos itthat said love game love system well thought couldnt imagine exp system region locked gear would work epic endlessly playable rpg wouldnt region locked gear would steam roll every region first one exp system would later steamroll thorugh everything system constantly stronger enemies wouldnt work aswell numbers would rise rise pc crashes well maybe also algorithm would hard programm thinkjust think genius system completly different everything know awesome wish ideas like also dont feel like starting bad time find items give huge starting bonus next region quest likely star weapon hour easypoints improvementartifacts rewardingmore quest way plsmaybe also quest limited specific biome type always see something newquestpls lemme pet petmore structuresbiome limited structuresin general contentmore symbols waypoints would nicebetter balancing different classes believe game room expand currently figure theres lot content behind think wollay always room improve thougheventually one area get point cant find anymore quests npcs area know dont items areaoverall think game definitely room improvement also enjoyable current state enjoy game however remember original one alpha came watched favorite youtubers playing became excited finally able use something could get play saw longer sale extremely upset found happened waited waited waited every would see something new pop wollays twitter announcement release dropped everyone including excited finally came saw almost everything weve seen twitter updates longer game lot stuff changed feel like game still great though think need slight improvements moving different zone works think progression much longer things increase stats permanently hopefully wollay listen majority fan base make improvements well wait see indeed like game kind know wollay thought makeing big changes removing exp system sooooooo reagon lock literally everything except stuff think reagon lock ok removing boat hang glide bad think shouldnt use mods stop still exp mod guy working skill artifacts alot like gear stats combat system good first gonna get rekt everythingi watched alot videos im saying saw videos hours gameplay like game super confusing dont take wrong way minecraft clear way starting since game come years least people know trove clear way telling quest dont know cube world game acts like sandbox want way opinion add way see quests unlock talking npcs going memory much take new player like hope add something like would make worth miss infinitely scaling skill trees alpha otherwise overall improvementi love exploration aspect game regions lot smaller used time theres somehow much onetheres plenty incentive talk wandering npcs many add points interest map points interest often regional gear upgrades upgrades include gnomes raise quality items buy town crafting books allow craft higher quality itemsthe combat amazing maybe even better subclasses feel defined used differences much prominent dodging still always subclasses ability jump higher usual allowing dodge horizontal attack jumping quite useful feels absolutely amazing pull offmy biggest gripes game regional gear lack information locking gear specific region feels like inconvenience anything reins boat especially problematic riding readily available form transportation sailing far fastestas telling player whats doesnt really happen kind get thrown right game making character information get abilities youre left figure everything else barebones control scheme nothing game explained youi would talk multiplayer isnt clear dont friends game thus dont opportunity figure process playing coopi loved playing alpha love still worked time love finally released im thrilled playing full game heavy exploration aspect npcs helpful finding good stuff figure lot stuff still amazingly fun play like game right hate workswaited years loving original game thinking every yearwhat kind alpha player liked full legendary geared liked combat hence loved dungeon farming geari liked strong got exploring felt strong enoughnew cube world doesnt offer cant recommend game right nowam saying game absolutely noteverything changed happens spread good word game recommend buying years dead silence get game feels like even less content alpha released back hope devs dont go radiosilent respond criticism improve game doubtful recommend buying game brings joy rep recommend game current difficulty curve steep start barely able fight even weakest mobs strength entirely based loot drops either get lucky find drops make overpowered early unlucky find constantly fear attacking anything doesnt take much theres also structure spawns much chance running legendary beast common weaker enemy fresh crafting doesnt really help game crafting barely feels worth times resources either feel rare expensive better chance finding better loot grinding gear regionlocked youll see pointed multiple reviews yes gear applies region picked go outside region becomes useless gear drops allow keep stats venturing another region gear rare ive also heard gear limit regions used cant say sure played long enough test special abilities pick also given treatment gear leave region goes away includes things like hang gliders ability ride pets combat bit shallow nice abilities change based weapon change specialization town thats start abilities change play game found attack combination works expect keep using duration play little progression game youre fortunate enough get gear make nearly unstoppable wipe region clean get artifacts leave region however different starting new character progression get artifacts boost things like running swim speed even differences negligible youll barely notice change youre grind difference look biome enemies youll facein summary game shallow mess endless pointless grind clearing region moving another one different remaking character first hours game play pretty much entire game change scenery lamp light radius little bigger think game lives alpha state numerous systems things game quite fun complete first region youre left nothing start blocks sidei think game good game essence couldnt recommend recommend keep eye see anything changes game positive manner write reviews felt like needed things find stupid complain aboutmost people complaining alpha completefleshed game actually side step yes xp system gone yes lose items cross zones mark changes make game constantly challenging encourages completion zones make next one easier without change players would become overpowered making bored quickly point infinitely generating world lastly complain creator ignoring community feel entitled dev man team job struggled mental health think drop everything cater say need grow upthings actually bad decisionnot allowing use transportation artifacts transportation essential get game walking around feels slow riding mount keeping transportation would make easier go biomes keeping difficulty new areas well artifacts annoying part though grinding hours area big reward artifact improves transportation minuscule amount personally know replace needs change something useful fun maybe different colored mount idkwhy giving game positive reviewi spent hours release playing game friends blast game visually appealing game challenging enough kill us constantly poor teamwork leaves extremely satisfied beat mob extremely difficult combat satisfying different weapons different things giving player bunch different ways playshould buy gameyou buy enjoy game sink hours ability watch show something require full attention enjoy unique style game never played game enjoyable friendsyou buy want game years ago want overpowered challenged hours think aaa game ability fix criticism weekthings hope forfixing transportation different biomes artifacts would also appreciate gradual increase classes player play maybe add druid another healing class besides game great hope people give honest try instead giving hate train game originally almost like everyone played years ago dont agree everybody whos dissapointed game understand dont entirely agree think lot things change years dont get mad game believe update improved already really fun game issues wont deny believe however issues nearly innevitable especialy minimal playtesting throughout years blast game espeacially multiplayer go grab friends make even better dont care hype dont care expectations enjoying game couldve something greater still could game fun worth price enjoying lot playing greatest dream game developer doesnt get discouraged negative reviews continues work game people seem forget game made entirely one man wife like right end story id love see content added dont even know start review honestly bought knowing update would suck wanted see yeah right sucks level system region lock items enemy level scaling skill tree completely killed awesome progression game feeling explore world would like know dev really thought region locking items would good move everyone would like game completely sucks current state dont even motivation move another region explore map completely dumb way items equipment work played alpha version till lvl cant even play one hour straight without ragin entire system dont buy wolfram add mod support let community fix game end wanted play old cube world dont even really know startits absolutely baffling people trying hard defend update almost inarguable made game worse years agoi really really wanted refall love game changes mind boggling im sure someone else made comprehensive list unnecessary changes important one change core gameregion locked progressionthis change beyond dont think ive ever seen case developer absolutely destroying work much one sincerely hope wollay going return older form update full game release severely doubt changes game back used ill change review positive one rather negative onedo buy sunkcostfallacy fans waited years full release waiting six years full release justify downright bad game unless wollay fixes core gameplay cannot recommend game good consciousnesshonestly youd better playing alpha dont find process losing progress gear mobility items repeatedly explore new regions compelling gameplay loop stands artifacts worth effort obtain provide substantial upgrades cannot recommend cube world current state dont know fellas kinda like new changes dont like wally region lock everything else really fun time game amazing opinion get mod disables region lock dont like dont like idea restarting completing zone get small buff next zone small buff may even go towards increase damage defense traveling around big maps hassle dont pet yet reins reacquire go another zone way know people might like kind game reminds much mobile clicker games dont like gamethats dont like game become said mod removes region lock fantastic multiplayer game good fun im still fun update stop fun get mod enjoy good game dont normally leave reviews however case felt compelled tomany individuals upset cube world live expectations rpgnow following game years always understood passion project team two think thats alot unsatisfied reviews forget game wasnt created large team infinite resources said people correct questionable game design choices however choices opinion make game unplayable fun still enjoy playing cube world still love game wollay pixxie thank work love put making unique experience dont recommend buying game yet since unfinished probably wont finished time soon dont recommend game expensive little brings relevant progression running simulatior feels unfinished much games better cube world cheaper cash grab release break promises coward developer literally zero comunication dont suggest playing game nothing like version purchased dont think people give wollay enough credit talentbecause idea else make game badi game years since alpha lacking terms content pretty fun combat simple fun dodging warrior could also block skill trees simple satisfying allowed get stronger stronger abilities usually pretty simple uses would often spam much possiblei loved knockdown stuff luckily combat hasnt changed much basically using heavy attack knock enemy attack satisfyingremember mentioned skill tree yeah well removed rpg game apparently theres way upgrade stats couldnt stand playing game longer especially shadow much fun used anyway start abilities unlocked youd think cant possibly difficult enemies spawn practically random levels cant fight half things encounter alpha would sometimes encounter bulls pain pretty much impossible kill half times died chance well cause pull hair years wollay add skills rework map maybe one asked skill tree removed try game release jesus christ wollay dont think horrible game could good problem friends multiplayer spawn literally kilometers apart im refunding game unless gets good update im purchasing dont understand people complaining game much better years ago definitely doesnt punish exploration regions big take everything moving one region another gear set back part replay valuethe previously released version cube world alpha alphas always subject change given time developer clearly thought direction right one gameof course game isnt without flaws artefacts could maybe work transition regions probably forgiving glidersboats etc waiting long game im happy able play polished version dont understand loot levels restore go different biome good game travel experience bad need find city rare level system changed good defet monster day long quest dont gonna level need find artifacts thats really rare skills system good deleted could make complicetd bigger made small poor thats beta game improves good luck update make better dont understand reviews negative personally cant stop playing see people dont like region progress thing wich indeed little bit wierd without would ran content much faster time explore regionsi think developer add something like artefact related place place number artefacts get combat bosses something like thataside game great play good amount time personally im great time playing alone friend general ideea game relied exploring combat see wayby way game worth money friends play times much entertaining playing fiends choose different classes dont fight lootthanks attention dont usually write reviews seeing negative feedback getting feel like musti loved game back alpha years ago even though little different im still ton funis game would recommend someone thinking playing solo maybe friends game countless hours amazing funif didnt receive game due paying alpha wouldve purchased either wayim really looking forward content updates cant wait play dont usually write reviews almost feel need game let potential buyers know expect game moving forward ill try structure concise orderly fashion make things easy possible understand included tldr bottomill limit review two subjects developer game developerthis game quite bit controversy baggage attached feel potential buyer made aware first game announced sold around years ago alpha state included roadmap development well received many looking forward new planned features detailed said roadmap first weeks release developer released minor bug fixes disappeared six years read correctly six years communication whatsoever occasional twitter update saying things like new map system works every year interaction community updates game explanation going nothing whatsoever many theories disappeared well official statement developer choose believe implore research matter six years later returns announcing cube world steam well beta launched old alpha players jumped try everything went south like really south people happy changes dev made expressed dissatisfaction steam forums discussion page dev respond lock delete negative posts ban users giving negative feedback essentially trying censor silence naysayers community people got angry forums became battlefield white knights mods flamers valuable focused feedback thoughts getting lost somewhere things calmed somewhat forums still something mess sad part even whole mess developers little voice communicating community done nothing address communitys concerns way shape formnow get point developer recommending game simply put cant trust support game last time sold disappeared six years leaving clients hanging whats say wont also going actually communicate community developer terrible track record arguably perfect example everything developer indie never im sorry say faith trust developer feel obligated warn potential users approach developer caution theres much say developer handling game order keep things concise ill stop game itselfso six year disappearance developer comes back everyone ecstatic excited see back see game fell love fully released finally excited see added sixyear period new quests dungeons regions classes items etc added short answer well cube world wasnt even close game promised six years ago features actually taken rather added features like leveling skills random map seed generation armor weapons new leveling system boy large number players like simple look forums reddit show roadmap developer presented us initially selling game thrown wayside wouldnt problem except fact developer never communicated changes player base paying customers blindsided us radical controversial changes game paid supported six years ago heres outline new game mechanics process give potential buyers idea game worksyou spawn almost naked random location oftentimes get killed repeatedly higher sometimes leveled mobs rhyme reason spawn locations spawned next legendary tier enemy maybe get lucky rng cause mob drop piece gear youre extra lucky gear class playing actually wearable also random quests random npcs give gear youre lucky youll find one matches tier level somewhat close movement game somewhat slow stand good chance accidentally running higherlevel mob path kill rinse repeat geared tier gear fight tier mobs rinse repeat way tier take area dungeon get artifact artifact increase random stat related exploration extremely minor increases swim speed sailing speed climbing lantern light etc combat increases whatsoever keep mind thats important part comes later leave area go back beginning paragraph read except time dont spawn walk im serious leave area everything character resets gear resets back zero lose exploration items hang glider boat harp flute etc literally start back zero like started new game thats gameplay cycle cube world remember artifacts dont really end helping new areas boats hang gliders spent time trying find previous region gone let alone fact artifacts dont help combat whether good system everyone decide absolutely despise feel new changes terrible game seems punish one factors made great alpha thats exploration beg research formulate opinions quests procedurally generated overarching story complete meaning likely thing every region area literally quests different names different locations cube world used endless exploration adventure seems focus endless repetition well almost endless considering one map seed everyone game shares unlike minecraft map actually finite run things eventually ever get fartldrthe game surrounded controversy developer poor history involving limited abandoning community years changing game exponentially initially promised roadmap without letting customers know censoring community etc new gameplay cycle fun engaging real progress made ever dont want overly negative support developer long journey get leave honest opinion current gamewhen purchased alpha family played heck girls would collect pet treats fun regenerating worlds son would go exploring leveling try get strong enough beat difficult dungeons fun game fun excited morehere many years later kids grown less time game grind unfun everything seems geared pun intended long plays spending lots time collecting stats order get item artifact move onto another area cant pickup play like used game forcing playstyle dont like everything thought fun alpha removed cannot give current version good review game years ago would never bought itwe got moneys worth alpha hopefully continue play wont playing current version tried fun hopefully dev reconsiders many changes returns cubeworld unique inventive game years ago mark dont want lose hope gamei still like fact mods easily addable game makes good dont write reviews games suggest anyone looking buy game wait improve game right terrifically fun rewarding truly different alpha amazing dont get hatehave watched alot videosstreams finally play myselfi really like dont know ever read guy bought game alpha many years ago old enough buy pc minecraft came friends always looking alternative like stumbled upon game honestly didnt play whole lot concept exactly wanted alpha kinks checked game every year like years think read dealing mental struggles trying make everyone wanted pressure put apologize hope matter people say overcoming struggle finishing something big game found peace closure id love see game grow become even expected even hope well dont need write lot honestly game lacks lot things enjoyable long run like meaningful progression one biome pretty much covered everything since reset every biome region lock mechanic needs get skill trees back combat pretty boring crafting items pointless crafting materials pretty scarce artifacts get completing biome less underwhelming meter radius upgrade lantern fun get provide use really since dont see shit night anywaythis game could great state cant recommend anyone reallyi still hope devs turn around even dont adress concerns fanbase pretty much funded game dont recommend would fix messed would great levels would actually give useful stats alpha dont think bad game lot going good game cant recommend right region locked gear hang glider etc times im sailing boat randomly disappears new region really puts damper exploring huge map dont even know gona start wait game long time like many others game get still pretty good like play like walking try find staff around end game fine goldyellow gear end gona travel next region thet moment progress stop coz max gear lvl gona kill every thing take h get one think able full gear fully completed regions dont fell progress fell character stronger anything find blue weapon plus gona make half task next region easy hell dont really care people saying game ive waiting play years thoroughly enjoying dunno couple friends bought alot fun playing played alpha released years back yah stuff changed doesnt bother like looking artifacts killing getting killed bosses dont really mind whole losing gear travelling new region fun go new place get strong also think could cool changes might make game better course skill tree thing alpha interesting dunno impactful maybe would cool gear game adjusted cd damage effects skills something like dunno couple pets think pet ui stats page would nice maybe pet skills tooi think biggest thing like player coop buddies always run problem finding games play together perfect us make one friends play water mage op healing anyways fun enough friends dont like thats fair feel like people salty changed think naturally people really resistant change enjoy game enjoy enjoy game region lock putting overall enjoy game fighting works dugeons changed alpha enjoy game level system different normal system im fine sits well cant wait play friends enjoy game someone didnt play alpha doesnt live alpha version still fun play rights recommend playing friends add experience enjoy game better worse alpha list basic combat greatly improved alpha addition subclass unique ultimates advanced combat made worse removal spirit cubes olist looked cool added buffs weapons help combat olist equipment region locked exception gear effective neighbouring regions one unlocked fixes medium term balancing expense short long term balancing boats gliders reigns also region locked meaning olist exploration current region encouraged exploration neighbouring regions discouraged olistlist enjoy despite controversies difficult equipment challenge enjoyed alpha hundreds hours mostly multiplayer alone obviously worth im probably going tossed biased category isnt biased choice purchase current state without playing first would im honestly sure however say running one area solo rewarding challenging fun get hang mechanics running second area fun well couple pieces blue gear hours challenging fun worth dont know id buy current description reviews ive never felt ripped ive played plenty games cost hrs enjoyment rest multiplayerim looking forward trying bit friends ill probably bench keep eyes open updates might fix progression issues perfect worth yes frustrating yes game interesting design doesnt top list games id replay hundreds hours hopes could hope devs dont disappear id like see continued improvements game bit begin next project either way id recommend playing like voxel style games adventure rpg feel enjoyed kind realized literally every artifact region locked reason instead maybe making artifacts little sparse encouraging adventure items become nonexistent entering new region becomes grind fest move basic survivability enjoyed playing game friends family regions disappointed everything longevity regions got gold weapon everything around easy challenge point also feels like missions finding items hope modding community save know fact wolly isnt good enough developer enjoyed alpha also love game nowdo buy game expect game alpha stage changedif like gameplay mechanics buy enjoyed alpha game lot still enjoy playing beta changed overall still enjoy even hours feel bad making negative review still support creators personschoices made games design kills fun people including carfeul want buy everyone find motivation continue playing first zone completed possible game fits standards consider buying feel like case feel like might person doesnt problem game tried playing sure isnt alpha finished product ever alpha beta idk man think fun also admit music nice feel like went car dealership payed ticket draw free car arrive find got golf cart needed money repairs buying new car feel like alpha actual beta beta actual alpha happen feel like potential still treasure system updated include permanent buffs useful character skills would wonderful plus think weapons continued evolving got instead becoming useless would help feel like theres reason go next zone ive zone started might well start new character since relic upgrades hilariously get gear yeah thats cool ive never seen one drop besides likely would class im feel like game gets criticism deserves simply didnt live years worth hype yes flaws region locking gear annoying progression overall individual regions bit jank still find plenty fun requires patience like exploring completing games youll get good longevity aesthetic charming combat fun albeit unfair times apparently alpha skill based havent played yet familiar become current systems pull better feels yes flaws game half decade ago sounds like something might like chances feel like product direct reflection emotional rollercoaster developer went years worked product wish wolfram best game feels empty compared back alpha small children may enjoy currently worth price tag feel bad writting think share experience beta played piracy version beta cuz didnt buy years agowell years waiting many us expected many things watching wollay posting incredible pictures twitter huge cities huge bosses many things dont remember always tought game going boom comes awesome wrongin web developer see things actually waiting like skill threes many things actually feel frustrated high cant describei much wollay fun im probably always going know pass trought always tried add content add things new version waiting fori played hours say played content yes mean hours know content literally complete game mean get legendary whats next repeat whole cycle thanks loli hoping wollay breaking cycle make something different indeed hes current path actual mechanics broken thats think mean hell man maybe someone complain say dont understand rpg roguelike played many cant literally think years development game theres nothing play maybe im hater perspective im huge fan wollay know fix moment think game bad hours everyone say expect people obv dont think mechanics bad badly implementedall mechanics need good implemented things like skill tree bosses bassed lore game fix region lock add custom weapons add huge cities potions armors add contenti play months weeks know wollay change perspective view game moment game worth hours cant recommend im probably wrong im aspects hurts much write negative review waiting years wollay please turn bad game one everyone remember lives feel old progression system much better new one turned game feel many noticed progression game alpha beta changed much however think could serve good way guide game back towards greatness wont damn game use alphas progression tje betas exploration aspects like region system minus gear locking could see game becoming good played ton alpha would prefer leveling skill system anyday though voicing oponions negarive light send wollay back abyss nother years id want avoid tyvmas community cube world enthusiasts formerly make clear current path game taking steered clear knew loved game maybe maybe make game keep making betteras review cant recommend atm dont think project doomed either find cubeworld fun game tho one big thing may turn leaving region armor weapons utilities region locked means got god year sword region region b sword super weak basically unusable thats armor also need refind stuff region like boat hand glider things change feel better game really slows get explore regions fly one aiming quests doesnt sound like something wont like isnt game permanent stuff game like artifacts crafting material potions food find strange many people dislike new system exploration comes question whether want create new characters become overpowered new system id argue pretty innovative needs minor tweaking become hit system basically allows infinitely play character without becoming broken beyond compare encourages travel explore new area foot yeah feels like starting new character terraria know sucks hermes boots wings awhile get used system wouldnt work locations looked like crap uninteresting thankfully cube world looks incredible vistas game almost breathtaking breath wild thats saying something mention much content present compared alpha different factions dungeons enemies etc theres lot see well worth potentially infinite amounts fun friends know played hours alpha alone heres another find game fun explorative rpg flaws im interested seeing changes happen beta period first encountered cube world sometime alpha even available buy obscure site name completely lost memory dont think around anymore couldnt refind id occasionally visit page keep date development never thought id get make steam review cube world due part fact knew cube world even knew steam played alpha bunch enjoyed immensely however would reach review likely aware alpha went unupdated game spent years isolated development following years silence like many others received complementary steam key gave steam release tryall said years development isolation simultaneously kind quite unkind cube world many ways game improved example combat removal skill tree giving players full set abilities start makes much consistent streamlined set combat mechanics help make moment moment gameplay enjoyable building character easier streamlined terms environments biomes shrunk meaning longer takes major time investment find new environment type explore theres lot new content experience terms new environmentsworld generation equipmentquests etchowever release isnt without issues lot draw comparison alpha flow progression almost entirely eradicated compared alpha rpg style levelling system gutted region based system left place loot exclusively useful region obtained though loot also used neighboring regions furthermore utility items like boat hangglider treasure tracker reigns etc region exclusive region biome every time move one biome next essentially start game maybe little boost loot cube worlds greatest fault currently stands writing review almost entire removal overarching progression bringing focus away constantly seeking stronger opponents thoroughly exploring smaller areas power take dungeons artifacts simultaneously made exploration areas feel completely redundant main goal game rigid structure renders cube world pointless second cross border one region another thing keep permanently artifact buffs come form small buffs specific types movement speeds ie hang glider speed boat speed climbing speed etc well lantern light radius take many increments even make remotely tangible improvementi never managed get enough category point felt anymore powerful dont make powerful make faster faster traverse areas faster move next areas traverse faster well yet significant portion movement types youre upgrading need reunlocked every region significant portion time alpha spend exploring map traversing world fun new system doesnt allow region minicubeworld rigid structure forced world means goal area work way strong enough getting artifact youve scoured biome artifacts either stay mess around cleared biome youve unlocked move start process making slower controlled repetitive version game alpha steam release ocean biomes favorite alpha excited oceans finding exploring new world side steam version reason favored oceans oceans lack ambient mob groups open water clearly communicated location points interest one point interest island cut filler gameplay mainland biomes suffered making faster efficient progress anything oceans empty wastes dotted islands points interest located trying prioritize exploration exploration turned chore rather treat spite still fond cube world steam allowed neutral reviews id made review neutral alright would recommend researching game make sure alley even remotely considering content removedchanged since alpha well features promised yet implemented top hype discourse easy lose sight reality gameplay cube world actually like single mans passion project still impressive wollay could quit developing game time thisd last available release game buy youre content fact could never updated content fact could updated way radically changes flow gameplay everyone honestly doesnt deserve nearly much hype praise hate received game everyone outright bad little bizarre developed bubble years possibly back developed bubble wollay returned silence mercilessly harassedtldr cube world alright single mans unfinished passionhobby project hard recommend account frustrating core gameplay loop inconsequential progression allround extremely repetitive nature followed cube world since alpha still great alpha found cube world weeks alpha first taken store page found going sold got super hyped ignored reviews purchased try boy feel bad people played hours cannot get refund one hour playing came across npc characters multiple times lost gear twice due area joined two regions minutes pure walking around looking something every single enemy came across would kick whatever npcs around helps ass new idea xp leveling doesnt make good one clearly executed poorly another complaint game single player unless friends dont think rpg bunch people running around run make friends whats even point exploring also entire map revealed even bunch updates game isnt going playable long time hate say want game like go ahead play gulp trove barf still better interested entertained cube world could ever provide final rating fully recommend game one condition everyone wants buy game install free mod gets rid regionlock makes items scale fixes issues game fairly easily progress game still hopeful developer wife fully integrate changes make game reminding charm old alpha cubeworld gave honest try really years waiting lead disappointment game deviates far expected ittook everything fun like character progression made everything worse fixed stats rng loot cant even use actually getting anywhere slog grinding hard anymore game simply refuses yield point hit brick wall cant get stronger keep trying move fun anymore gave game positive review moved another region get community pissed clear wollay didnt want game like back alpha something became aparrent beta game still great personally sink hours problem play easier start new region money gear might everyone please look videos decide purchase get lot mixed reviews game friend spent days straight playing opinion far worth lot people complaining leveling system removed didnt much impact alpha like levels didnt mean anything anyone whos actually complaining go back play alpha see changes opinion better get complains still great game tho get criticisms different alpha love though really fun game give game positive rating enjoy time though completely understand many people wouldnt think theres interesting ideas done perhaps quite executed best ways main hope developer doesnt get overly discouraged negative reviews obvious interesting design ideas though admittedly could benefit disappearing bit less giving game secound chance honestly lot fun u feel adventure u find play style understand game really takes get good understand difficulty u get reset move new area lore stays plus gear stays region around keep gold consumables crafting gear well nice artifacts gold crafting materials carrying nice buy good gear right away u get shop upgrades eventually enough materials start crafting good gear crafting expensive think system use biomes first also pets carry would cool u could ride time harness region lockedone addition would would add tier plus gear like star gear double plus gear would much harder find craft overall harder get plus gear gear would global could u equipment every region balance would start stars would need powered white green blue purple gold progress like region star gear becomes weaker u find white gear upgrades power star gear star another rarity gear would upgrade star gear yu would weak first biome gear would power upover like concept state game feels like adventure xd got hours fun game play first days beta totally worth didnt play much alphathe start brutal hand holding every time gain items work zone found loved timethe game needs additional character progression get play restarting scratch every new zone gain items gets old quickly also could use many little ui tweaksfor person passion project awesomeberserker forever got boat sailed feet disappeared things like game may change review future updates improve experience worth imho got cube world alpha liking idea rpg got along lines half finished roguelite cant recommend current state got moneys worth good laughs butthis literally scam figuratively literally dont support got alpha first came loved itwell hours beta rage quits latei learning game much changedits like zone world quests gear tied zoneenter new zone starting collecting gear zonemake sure complete zone going nexti hear switch back gear zonesi hope true would nice got warning cross zoneoh well mater adapting changes first step changes alpha release massiveand well done yet run bugsthanks wollay pixie got game way back alpha released liked still like nowthe gameplay quite fun progression unique spent lot time playing games never came across anything like give tip get ahead try making neutral mobs fight hostile ones gear c savagealpha dogsthe developers really nice responded quikly questionsi found bugs considering indie game rate got back loved problem developer completely stripped best parts game went completely silent honestly best scam ive ever seen gg wollay gg got free technically alpha player still want money back games developer vanished twice hope improved upon youre better trying find friend alpha play since got offer got game back alpha even though changed game great even better friends run around see find world got game back alpha beta lot different alpha shouldnt listen everyone complaining changes game game feature doesnt inherently suck different alpha players used personally think game still amazing region locking adds lot gameplay time good thing going get better sure tweaks game could get still amazing game much worth purchase especially friends play withfor example maybe dont remove gliderboatreins miduse make cant reactivate different region wont fall sky stranded ocean let universal get themsecondly specific enemies drop specific loot like rocklings drop ores think right food related enemies drop food loot probably already works something therethird dedicated servers would awesome mmo style enemy respawning first people dont clear everything would love see world full players running around pvp would also spectacular since dying doesnt really take anything fast travel thingmight add later regardless still amazing game get friend play got game today played straight hours honestly fun ive long time much fun exploring land find monsters kill loot find everyone given game bad reviews upset like alpha really like playing got game first came like great many people alpha put hundreds hours playtime excited every time showed possible new addition yearssadly however everything alpha updated version beta removed levels removed exp removed ability keep gear removed skillsyou wanted go island bad strong sudden crossed border epic weapon armour worked getting useless unless small area gamethey added things sure end lose sort triumph sort see thisi got hard work instead repedative constant grind little show everything stops workinghopefully fixes back alpha levels untill ill play old version got key alpha way back feel like downgrade wait buying maybe another years grew cube world alpha loved game much cute design procedural generation amazing combat system understand wollays development timeline game full stress anxiety mental health problems gotta give honest criticism gamethe progression would make sense less instant somehow realistic lose progress explore new area game deflates excitement makes feel progression hasnt happened rpggrind games supposed make feel like youre becoming continually stronger game rips away instant feel extremely bad way wollay treated cube world community release alpha newer steam version guess im minority say actually enjoy game played alpha way back came fun got bored aimless lot world explore much really get people like sandboxes wasnt mecube world got lot flak separated regions individual progression loops equipment special items thats actually favorite thing changed goals start go new place still goals reachif make complaints would regions could bigger gameplay loop could last longer also ocean biomes auto give boatbut hey everyone gets opinion think fun game guess game enjoyable like old fun play sessions launch past days trying play game caused computer crash believe fun truly worth purchase lot fun friends also fun playing solo really enjoy game play lot future also dont understand people keep saying alpha better version alpha beginning also pretty difficult well end game boring repetitive way contentas well bunch fixes game lot fun game alpha still version room improvements already worth price better memories making bets whether game would updated actually playing fun hours lost interest change regions start scratch takes long fully regear time move regions maybe wait sale interested id avoid otherwise gotten game alpha years years ago better back high hopes alpha terrible enjoyable maybe te first region leveling gear farming end absolutely useless sure get ever better hope since loved alpha high hopes new release game played alpha years ago patiently looking forward major update since game current state missing numerous features weve either seen development wollays twitter means big rpg multiplayer gamer really feels like absolutely endgame true progression increases various movement ability types gear drops even legendary feel quite underwhelming say least xp talent trees leveling xp increasing power never removed expanded revised high hopes game like people first liked fair amount realised fcked game isthe alpha showed lot potential better progression system game almost every way betterthe thing hurts fact seems like developer totally abandoned game although game could use updates fixesoverall really mean really want check ous id wait sale unless developer returns would recommend excuse go cry corner high hopes game announced released steam expectations completely trashedthere seems less content alpha version xp system gone instead god forsaken region lock fetature punishes explorationand top havent heard word wollay since launchthis game lot promise opinion got wasted recommend buy game least current state hopes high thought would build promising alpha nah biggest reasons loved game removed changed drastically free exploration restricted region lock mean could explore want wont riding pets hang glider boat climbing claws yeah good luck exploring holding w half hours see weird looking tree something dying something trying find new spawn point walk distance loved huge cities dungeons xp skill tree gone god even miss ear sound sleeping inn also could well make new game create new character instead going new region wouldnt different hate everything previously acquired uselessunusable dont remove game steam library make buy game could explore another area gamejust remember refund window hours played game back alpha whenever come enjoyed greatly share thoughts towards release although realmlocked loot extremely annoying felt like crippling areas simple mod resolves makes game much enjoyable point contention leveling system believe original system much better rewarding whereas leveling feels meaningless mod mentioned disables arealocked loot definitely game would recommend anyone enjoyed alpha quite fun hours absolutely indications losing everything change land also annoying im waiting content change review feels like always thing best moments friends playing alpha sinking hours upon hours well waited waited something come felt like every day wollays twitter waiting excitement hype perhaps undoing undoing many others loved alpha base game cubeworld fun things going questing system needing artifacts level upwhich dont get started brighter yeah ok dont even mind region locking system better done skill trees combat system good fall sky crossing regions actually gave good laugh first time happenedmy overall main issue feels like soul gone game friends could go around hours beating unbeatable dungeons fighting fierce bosses kind want like game anything world cant said core game still fun id say play friends id never played long much journey one imo could make better artifacts useful keeping traveling gear travel regrinding gear fine anyone plays rogue likes fine high hopes cube world sht hit fan everything region locked everything worked hard honestly would super happy uploading alpha version game steam add biomes weapons npcs etc build game since alpha releasethe new leveling system without xp takes getting used think good alternative regular xp levelinggetting better gear way go bit like zelda games also xp system instead rely items become better played version last days enjoyed quite also multiplayer friend minei hope development game contiue current state development recommend pleasure already getting moneys worth alpha sadly game receive imagine wow reach lvl beat final raid get thrown back lvl permanent strength repeat process times total permanent strengthif sounds fun game also developer even semblance community interaction would swell happen hope game choose one im leaning towards thumbs bad game im one gamers bought played original soon came years ago back adventure game lite rpg elements adventure game lite action elements dont fault wollay trying something different messing around new version prefer older systems let start stating game going itpositive beautiful voxel world maybe prettiest voxel genre landscape beckons explore nintendo charm polish look feel sound feels like im playing classic game modern engine collecting pets great past time game assist combat double mounts etc love gaining new pet like questing find something new subbiome explore keeps magical feel open world wonderous place explore plenty different biomes hang gliding mountains boating across oceans deserts jungles oceans volcanic swamps leads thenegative beautiful voxel world explore preferred explore feel handcuffed one biome ocd allows move another think cleaned leads another issue like starting every biome gear specific biome along things enjoy slow build rpg repetitive grind arpg starts constantly id problem wollay going towards arpg rpg keep slow permanent progression would still one major issue combat underwhelming especially warrior class close range class combat feels clunky uninspired since leveling defeating enemies easy task early stages feels unrewarding get coins end avoiding combat fun game trying nudge towards arpgso allinall little disappointed never played alpha recommend checking great game hidden behind counterproductive systems maybe hell fix rerelease itll perfect tons fun old version compared one got replayability fix simply starting new game new seed really enjoyed looking interesting seeds loading playing investigating new version provides couple hours gameplay since region functionally others hours version game think happened everything good fun happened neat features adding advancements tweeted like forgot going sell game studio fixfinish point save face thinking getting dont game fundamentally broken believe steam allowed even sold knowing history clown making hours record played friends ready put away good friend figured system works started talking npcs town everything made sense fair warning region system artifacts experience experience positive lot play time says played years ago group friends good solid weeks fun ran content sat waited updates updates dried word began circulate abandoned devs cut run uninstalled moved forgotten today found mentioned steam got old account redeemed key steam took stab say changed lot better seen become really disappointed actually got less used progressions cut next nothing short grind cannot experience devs past state game justify recommending game lengthy history cube world alpha tester six years ago buggy errors needed optimization know didnt care enough good game keep playing great time fast forward experience really hasnt changed mean good way know internet hate machine works people recognize flaws game best try destroy shoveling crap developers try get many internet lemmings join process possible led game shuttered six years words effect others living breathing human side monitor people often forget thisyes cube world issues mistakes made one saying isnt true however truly believe game deserves better reception received game beautiful full exploration simple fun aaa title never meant new beginning treated suchso whats awesome voxel open world dungeons craftingwhats game difficulty needs character progression isdifferent quite fun wrap head around game currently needs optimizing polish throughoutthats pretty much strongly felt game lot potential six years ago nothing ive seen far changed opinion may cup tea truly believe fun game worth time price check watch game evolve lot nostalgia game carried far ive gotten id lying said didnt fun certainly ive reached point im rather discouraged game likely wont get many hours anythe big problem lack longterm meaningful progression gear reset every new region best gear regions outside immediate vicinity near found huge problem gives distinct feeling treadmillyou start every skill youll ever get theres progression tools get reset every new region enter gear either similar actual progress make finding artifacts provide tangential benefits arent particularly notable satisfyingits bad enjoy gameplay skills levels mean something gear works every region could find motivation keep playing id feel like im getting somewhere making lasting progressbut cant im treadmill never ends changes gets boring fast point would better revert alpha version played years agoi hope wollay chooses make improvements given pension radio silence nobody know either happens doesntif bought original alpha get free email picroma support go worth hours nostalgia fun stuff gets old futility gets crushing youre thinking buying first time id suggest itall said dont agree hate sent towards developer game regardless current state fact managed two people massively impressive deserve praise hope development continues however long takes end day still think game charm ive found anywhere else lot respect dedication wollay developer game one many play game half decade ago back alpha steam release literally everything different new features really cool exploration important mechanics great ideas well implemented game still lot fun mostly nostalgia sake think game potential great right wouldnt recommend purchasing perhaps future update fix issues fingers crossed could choose maybe rather yes would quite yes love love relationship gameplease understand even without official means record number hours played game lowball estimate spent collective hours past years playing alpha kinda hard find time play im college even hooked game time reali never found addicting game single engaging game ever played reason would stop playing due time restraints put hours civ terraria xbox ive played hella csgo games fun high game fun matter situation level sobriety time restraintsmy relationship game might reason im giving praise devoutly following game previous years rediscovered forgetting years game captured attention due fact lot minecraft youtubers reviewing giving high praise game even within minecraftinfested youtube space bought wollay stopped selling thought inside club people legitimate copies game even insider outsider mindset always held would eventually go sale would available friends buy showed friends werent interested big portion actually interested game disappointed wasnt available purchase sale status reduced normal consumeri say without doubt game fun worth dollars long deal somewhat janky multiplayer experience long enough get considerable accurate sense feelings release probably tainted glassesnote free product disclaimer due alpha key owners getting free steam key due patience still bought alpha key therefore purchased game receive beta version steam free long time alpha player really want love game however feel everything loved game taken replaced pointless endless grind leveling system changing zone based progression isnt necessarily bad thing fact progress essentially reverted back nothing beginning new zone less artifacts receive give small stat bonuses useless bonuses like gliding speed makes stale experience game alpha received high rarity weapon felt set play wanting needing replace game nothing really matters since redone soon enter new zone top zones big exploration extremely limited want current gear really hoping wollay apply type change system make feel even little bit rewarding loved game years really want succeed cant see right cant recommend buying current state enjoying time game progression game find obtaining next tier gear satisfying updates definitely needed get reins boats etc region bit needless biggest thing worry developer theyor hes one guy think wife dont good job keeping us date would nice know game still worked enjoying new adventure cube world new system may turn lot people dont think couple hours play game justice levels increase character stats gear works beyond one region super rare music added enjoyable surprising new biome type explored hope ost becomes availablethe world truly infinite endless even lore heroes cults treasures treasure hunting also fun hidden bags gold armor weapons everywheredungeons unique far delved caves castles sewers coliseumsto name think game gem reminds every publisher wants piecemeal games garbage dlc buying complete game feels quite refreshing part games journey since day created cube world discord server years ago recently hit members crazy ride still cant believe game nowto game different game different core mechanics compares alpha version game current idea progression game made longtime gameplay get hours fun exploring opinion still worth wollay decides update game contentwise future even worth getting waiting years buy game glad finally got chance saddened poor improvements made game never got play alpha version get watch iti also learning become programmer make game like developer game artist wifewith mind see many flaws game improved get qualityoflife patchesi want start game good combat best part cube world template quality every game made future mechanics clean flow really well battle five buttons used left right mouse button mouse wheel button shift r controls simple makes combat interactive swtor skyrim co op feature best ever seen game looking minecraft lan easy play friend friends although may part world randomly generated everyone plays map spawning location looks right enemies scale well players near make easy solo boss became powerful raid bossnow bad aspects cube prestige system fine little system get bothersome quickly becomes bigger bigger issue combined issues region locked gear feature prestige system grades star gear star gear think would fine way make gear relevant regions play region locked mobility items like boat hangglider saddle climbingboots items lost entering another region special items like treasure spirit sky flute spirit bell fine region locked core game items like mobility redundancy weapon upgrades horrendous region lock weapon youll upgrade star weapon youll get near end item crafting mechanic crafting items last major issue ill talk high cost items star tiers difficulty finding crafting items well planed large list friends steam people issues finding friends currently trying invite play filter friends list alphabetical orderwell read far thank remember cube world still beta game currently still room improvement sad see problems alpha beta hyped game finally want note issue hear people talk removal traditional exp system rpg games think fine cube world trying progressing system different way also understand exp system traditional mainstream standard refined many years gaming everyone use exp system hard weird people use exp system waiting years every time posted games progress twitter gave hope hope one day would finally released believe came birthday perfect gift ive waiting long time thoughti utterly disappointed words express disappointment communitys get easily offended pretty good portion rather huge portion itat point would best sold game game development company game future hands likely vanish another years wont even apologize fans feelsbadman waiting actually able play game years getting play worth hype gave massive world region locking colorful atmosphere lets feel like even investing game hours end still satisfied wanting play come appreciate systems new version game equipment generally tied specific zones must carefully pick battles quests feasibly win however first hurdle game finding appropriate equipment tackle challenging quests foes incredible size exploring starts lot fun quickly becomes tiresome fourth fifth time massacred creature wasnt quite field view really look systems online tutorial beyond basic command list press played first public releases many years ago really feel builds fun even respects simpler respects skill tree layers complexity removed thankfully crafting still interesting voxel based upgrade system still present feels combat never ever become complex first times figure elements class outits difficult recommend game right really feels unfinished unfinished game feels unfocused world creatures within beautiful way interact fun interesting sometimes player goals feel like work enjoyable experience hopefully updates alleviated given history developer updates past would surprise picroma completely disengaged another years see another substantial build followed game since alpha wished good much potential years development time version good would recommend purchasing alpha version dedicated website version wolfram please come back craft us masterpiece know create lot fun beta version got boring fast speaking alpha players perspective disappointed wait years update wish wollay updated alpha create entirely new game im sorry writtin harsh bigger expectations beta would look likemy wishes kept alpha hud kept old skills class kept skill tree system kept exp farming leveling system kept old structures like castles dungeons forests etc kept unexplored map added quest log added skill added new structures like beta added towns cities etc added creative building added reasons go explore example traveling biomes transporting items gifts npcs npcs eventually update optimize pvp made gold coins platinum coins use endless weapon armor customization designers animals meaning pet food massive region boss requires defeating smaller bossesthrere many cool features beta small would make big difference alpha example friends list flying friends free hope near future get see points writtin speaking hope yet game responsive bugs beta despite changing anything core gameplay related expect cant change whole game week ill give time vanish face earth well thats ill make final judgement never happy title screen edit expected still good never posted review dont know ever againthis game great experience past still alpha play time timei cannot play beta already havei decided play single zone instead exploring expansive map terrified idea resetting progressi moved different zone hours decided would rather find literally every single inch anything starting zone find equipment important movement tools againi loved old systembeing able progress infinitelyhaving skillbased enjoyable although rather empty gamewas incredibly fun online played friends years ago kept sanebut game feelsconstrictingi cannot progress towards goal game anymore besides finding artifacts improve abilities percentages similar chance find shiny pokemon pokemon gamei dont want explore cube world anymorethere finding unique exciting terrain anymoreif really wanted could fly ends planetfinding nothing climbing speed upgrade hours grindingpleasethere nothing look forward toin game never written actual serious review felt like really needed step amazing work wollay put gamei one guys bought way back alpha version really loved game mechanics put almost hours release clearly see difference alpha big changes wollay said went back several times make mechanics ground release really looks promising course finetuning left overall amazing game play game compare alpha please try long enough understand changes made enter game open minded like bound alpha really think great time really understand big changes wollay made game well thought ofgive try see effort wollay put game typical rpg clue people complaining playing game around hours strait love yes first hour two spent running around dieing trying different classes finally found class enjoyed archer rouge got foot hold amazing world game took also played around multiplayer heaps friend figured could fly one another great agree game could leveling system class dont think holds back game hours played mate nearly completed first region great fun would highly recommend giving game shot get chance go open mind hopefully someone reads gives game shot cant wait see game ends updates keep great work wolly experience alpha anything besides current release really enjoyed game far game lot travel time beating stuff get used little game tells beginning id say two things id say hold back perfect exploration game really feel game shouldnt much flak motivation energy bother review heres short quick opinionsunk hundred hours day im guessing basically im saying im experienced cube world players loved game literally wanted cubeworld quests bosses dungeons fun didnt get instead got poorly designed poorly implemented rework entire game ones denying update absolute trash sucking wolley loved cubeworld broke heart many even like new system simply implemented correctly straight design choices bugs mean intentional design choices quest items spawn certain locations entire progression system wrong opinions subjective isnt simply work well previous systems sad new decent content like bosses dungeons quests locked behind system go anymore details game sense progression art form videogame explain thats original cubeworld one knows honestly even worth completely lost motivation beautiful game played hours beta version cube world would estimate roughly alpha came ive enjoyed versions one main reason exploration aspect different biomes joy explore named areas like huge mountains incredible procedurally generated areas filled enemies quests hidden secretsregarding changes alpha beta understand reason change progression start unsure would work started new ranger character called bert set first region first thing saw group sheep thought problem charged bow ablaze ass handed spawned another unknown area set dodging different mobs running spotted patch started new players next village middle nowhere feeling lostby chance found village started chatting everyone could see map started fill points interest differing colours investigation showed difficulty areai set found volcano strange blue teardrop called treasure spirit stage idea managed beat low level mobs realised gear woefully powered anything green aboveas walking teardrop appeared led cave chest found blue level bow game changer finally could start take slightly tougher areas game opened unlocked lore dungeons really started enjoy game cleared map every dungeon entered supposedly artifacts strange purple force fields blocking areasit turned needed destroy crystals hidden towers one guarded sorcerer tried multiple times even fully maxed gear potions active got beat every time decided take step back think idea climb tree near tower snipe worked turns sorcerers cant climb trees managed kill boss destroy crystal completed first region artifactsi ready move new region knew power would disappear would starting good amount gold artifact gains knowledge made big differencei started slowly new region got town back swing found enough differences generated biome wetland quests really enjoy found huge mountains underwater caves vicious cyclops guarding legendary gear also watched sunset sailed back town pet biter beside felt goodthis game explorers like leave reality behind adventure best way play treat region new game new things see go explore quests require strategy solve helps keep things interestingim sure game everyone would say give go open mind think pleasantly surprised owned cube world since thoroughly played alpha beta versions game turned regular boring rpg level much everything easy stop playing game uniquely styled rpg instead make new character level slightly going difficult challenges every region nothing gets easier makes interesting opinion think artifacts could buffed bit lot people good solutions complaints people however couldnt stop playing game truly interesting think maybe added gamemode alpha style kept beta style well people would probably inclined play theyd choice whether want play hardcore style think shouldnt say bad traditional rpg like alpha version plenty people good time many people giving game fair chance pros consistent sense improvement gathering items always lookout better weapons armor feels great finally find pet system great think features pets could added make interesting already lot detail thought put theyre one useful things game implementation regions different biomes detailed different buildings dungeons awesome music wonderful immersive soundtrackcons need reason kill monsters level bypass anything isnt legendary would like reason benefit continue kill weaker enemies slim chance getting weapon boats glider reins permanent dont really need explain one ocean biome dont want swim island island find boat tutorial needed new players basically impossible know supposed unless look online play game since alpha got say nothing used however still think good game deserves love getting right played game since alpha like wouldnt recommend past knowledge game want try something new give try played cube world really enjoyed even tho keep dying startnow load press play go white screen cut even crashed computer really like game far want play soon hopefully ever wrong fix soon played cube world hours fun perfect beta game built two three people cant complane fun look forward updates game alot potential played cube world dont really like itwhole idea game cool actually rpg game without major rpg mechanics character got almost progression system always lvl thing change gear base gear hard beat even passive mobs actual quests dungeons need look better equipment luckily found epic weapon one altars able clear dungeon get fun fighting dont understand zones system entering different zone gear collected becoming totally useless look new gear also find even climbing claws boat glider cool game hours fun grind one zone without patch adding character proggression playing exploring new zones useless look exactly different biom played cube world almost week bad game problem game difficuilty progression system start cube world dont know anything dont good gear get one shotted almost anything tutorials hell didnt even know get quests game talked every single npc first town yes game hard needs clearer objectives different game alpha another complaint side artifacts reason play game get artifacts hard even worth artifact dont know permanent upgrade breaks region lock rules let keep rest game would cool one thing artifacts useless boost stats like riding gliding swimming would much cooler gave ability good stat enjoy difficuilt games sure give try dont like get refund otherwise wait sale enjoy game things need fixing played cracked version alpha man worse things liked skill trees exp based progression skill system gone replaced utter garbage im refunding game think worth price recommend played hour thing run around trying get beaten bugs much stronger best game played four hours relly like little hard understand first started relly enjoy myselfi recomend game played since early alpha years ago still favorite game date could recommend game much fun get back explore big open world really enjoys new combat zone systems providing game play loop real nice allowing grow power overall play highly recommend great friends great job devs played alpha disappointed well version game steambut believe get better recommend playing iti still love cube world pleaseif game would get developer promised everyone would happy played game alpha friend hyped saw got released quite mixed feelings game though system mechanic changed instead able equip strongest weapons gear immediately needed level order equip wish traveler like pretty hard time loved high gear entering new zone causes gear get low quality rubbish ones quite unnerving multiplayer sections also fixed got way worse first lack performance joining player host always huge delays minutes dying spawn server trying catch also would really appreciate option let friend spawn town thousands kilometres away never reach stuff find quite interesting instead annoying say hate lose collected items zones like riding gliding stuff alright leveling system could still interesting combat though added back improved buuut instead removed entirely getting items feels repetitive zone game still carries lovely theme enjoyably cute looking sounding always found way cute look friend bein chased mobs sorry buddy keep running seem changes mobs immediately chasing sight anymore least distance much shorter dont get beaten every half minute anymorehosting joining server friend much easier going game opening menu click host join new areas music added since alpha carry loving detailsthe quest system got improved single zone makes hard keep running friend curiousity gets better lot little avatar enough make look sweet sometimes absolutely ridiculous feel like good game issues need know beforehand never played alpha might consider changes normal recommend playing friends yet always try could also local issue friend focus zone though want improve feel like moving remember lose gear could get quite repetitive getting items next zone thoughwith mild lack improvement still recommend game put many hours game steam say one best games ever played really enjoyed game lot far lots fun grinding worried whole region locking thing first heard found items use couple areas one got feel way better conquered two areas far im looking forward morepeople keep saying good alpha would disagree game upgraded every way possible even new progression system better take someone played original alpha really enjoyed tiny time frame ive died mean played lmao really funpeople might like new system honestly really fun though havent played much might change doubt game seems get fun difficult gets say liked alpha item region lock good atm also many features canceled say hype kinda killed game fast soon played game noticed game much worse alpha released years agosince hasnt update yet wouldnt recommend game since game isnt could beand im pretty sure game wont get updates future better leveling system better progress system maybe better story would great waited years get love alpha wolay fixed annoying alpha questsno fast travel fixed great thought first glance took deeper look found wolay made game fun old comer borderline unplayable amazing wonderful beauty grind taken away removal level based system frankly furious wolay reading think game would benefit readdition level based system grind would suggest playing alpha instead waited long game release finally thought going greatest game ever played found regionlocking exists disappointment felt time almost crippling honestly prefer alpha lame excuse beta thinking buying game dont game current point unplayable fun like hours loses magic game supposed open world however restricts gear items boat one region dont waste money game waiting long finally people may saying bad good actually play quit playing minutes main complaint region locking even bad wanted game long remember six years ago wasnt old enough make money buy computer could even handle cube world let alone buying game taken websites store kinda heartbroken felt like would never get chance play game even though game six years later still feel way back theres much still desired title many mechanics missing actually game point majority time spent walking circles talking uninteresting npcs cute dialogue noises getting rear handed back silver platter basic enemies latter isnt lack skill either barebones even call progression system doesnt allow player skill even factor gameplay enemies hit way combat kiting npcs succeeding incredibly low chance get better gear leveling experience removed would okay replacement incredibly antiplayer loot system character level based level gear equipped straight fit gameplay surrounding cube world whether player even survive enemy attack entirely dependent whether lucky enough gear drop incredibly low drop rate turn leaves user enjoyment luck rngthis prevented enjoying game case point half hours ive played feel like ive gotten nowhere understandable lack direction voxelbased randomlygenerated open world game today execution subpar always earlier releases much fleshedout fun ive seen isnt game wanted bad six years game sitting somewhere wollays backup files hope someday give us isnt late game fixed havent played much peoples experience pretty clear still needs changes havent really played hour yet played alpha time alpha every attack certain flow even climbing walls felt good beta cant say feelings carried alpha found never getting bored played hours cant seem get play hour wollay know might going reviews feeling really sick stomach bad reviews completely understand anxiety attacks need listen customers want game amazing right doesnt charm alpha didupdate find stuff took almost hours even find dungeon cant complete equipment weak trying find good weapon depends rnggraphics beautiful good decent bad good allgameplay good good meh goodaudio good good bad baddifficulity press easy significant brain usage easy learn hard master difficultstory story text audio floating around average good outstandingprice free worth price recommended hear lot complaints game theres enough content someone content explore countryside level character move next countryside repeat smoothly colored whimsical graphics awesome varied aesthetics skills good number races classes try honest god dont get people freaking game close perfect indie game come long time super technically impressive person projecti guess totally sucks ass tho spent years projecting dream game onto victim large hype cycle give honest shot open mind prefer alpha almost every way find annoying dont ui party members also played like hours alpha total got completely burned multiple times honestly see many people played alpha upset get play time first time player game full release really enjoy game fun exploring go npcs get information certain locations items combat enjoyable like races included game lizard frog etc would recommend game especially get coop buddy join con game confused research level level system many artifacts game gear based entering new area gear basically useless awesome honestly dont get negative reviews problems cube world almost entirely balance issues half everything wollay promised added game shown following reddit yet everyone acting trashed game didnt follow promises ditched game goodwell im tell theyre wrong start playing cube world jump colorful dangerous world adventure explore region progress find key items access new areas obtain new gear help traverse map take progressively stronger enemies progress exploring every place see highly detailed world map combat dynamic nuanced different enemies take different approach fighting cant always easily circumvented gearing max exploring world taking unique challenges different regions fun engaging found staying late travel new places several occasionsas downsides gear crafting purchasing needs balancing reworks fill progression make worthwhile use resources useful tool smooth progression artifact bonuses need progression curve ideally following horizontal parabolic curve rather currently shallow linear progression order make appealing noticeable effect early game without diminishing negligible amounts late game items help smooth jarring transition region next theyre rare theyre unreliable theyre easy obtain highest tier lowest tier meaning theres reason go anything else loss transportation items across regions needs similar mechanic among various balance changesbut game still fun none downsides make game bad limit good game bei hope wollay keeps working cube world think game good lot potential could unleashed simple changes frankly nobody give dreams people arent satisfied progressi definitely would recommend cube world fan open world games enjoys aesthetic game able look past glaring balance issues hours fun hope wollay continues develop game something would recommend even people honestly dont know many people hate new version cube world first yes game changed majorly bad things like region locked items leveling get artifacts help small things make people go away say u god like weapons could kill everything one shot would get boring pretty quick still far better alpha version main game still hasnt changed really leveling system regions still great looking new monsters help make fresh recommend game friends seems encourage teamwork also fun alone better close friends thats got say honestly dont understand amount bad reviews game getting think come cube world alpha fans feeling betrayed gameplay changed muchi also played alpha felt pretty empty alpha duh new version game seems interesting fun played friend mine hours plan playing morei really like game maybe stayed time beta fair years alpha little short beta mere two weeksplease wollay even critics harsh keep working little gem still believe become truly wonderful game tho ffs get team members cant keep working complex game alone already puzzling youve managed build something good alone ill give years development lot honestly dont understand seems like awesome game tweets product end seems like even half game saw region locking honestly biggest thing removal type leveling system xp systems help feeling progression cents honestly feel bit betrayed ive put hours alpha extremely thrilled found finally fully released following game extremely closely come find closed beta wollay didnt make game compatible intel graphics cards rip laptop play alpha fine way discriminate intel users betray long time fans supported spoke highly throughout years youve silent honestly think pretty good game played years ago think massively improved honestly wish could still love game much content removed alpha release gameplay changed much get pleasure playing gamethe entire time playing kept wondering would get better didnt went back alpha wondered hell game went wrongdont buy game wish could say worth year wait honestly wish didnt write review game massive let time waiting updated hope things game go better time bearly give yes dont want creator get another mental breakdown hope game keep getting updates love hope game gets fixedessentially items determine strength leveling doesnt seem mean anything anymore gain artifact adds useless stat swimming speed oh boy youre level entering new region feels like starting new character items region locked items used anywhere seem extremely rare quite jarring exploring longer able use hang glider boat entered another region repeat quests last region order gain game great could explore anywhere actually retain progression terrain also changed significantly seems like interesting features templates havent come across mountain ranges like remember giant ones seemed stretch heavens exploring seems like chore start square one entered new regiontaking account think much game like bought game alpha wouldnt buy price hoped official rerelease game would somewhat like alpha back progressing much enjoyable skill tree gear progression exploration wasnt punished encouraged gain better gear items restricted regions leave region gear founded would become useless quests neccessary items hangglider boat repetitive shouldnt taken away found decided go another region hoped wollay would release fix soonits weeks single patch lets seejudging older alpha footage game much much better state xp system skill tree anything version doesnt anymore get wollay wanted something unique sadly turned south really fastyou got good gear better stay area otherwise useless thats right region locking rpg imagine playing borderlands going new dlc area suddenly legendary gun suddenly deals damage instead collecting artefacts hope enjoy climbing speedthe cool thing like game map instead randomly generated rather get dropped random location gigantic map nomanssky style wollay even got house coordinate game actually got huge revamp would means recommend please dont spend bucks game yet cant give positive loved alpha im kind meh thisnot big fan gear based progression spent like hours probably killed blue mobs get blue weapon class plenty hour farming tons purples getting many items cant use none cheesed star gold minutes completely skipped purple lucky gold wep drop everything easy except mage bosses literally getting one two shot feel like cant complete everything region get hit twice mages im dead half gold half purple armor liked setup progression alpha better like world one better feel like made progress hours like minutes progress progress hours alsoi could care less region locking want able get stronger outside hoping dropin opinionif world old level system levels region specific would still better opinion cant recommend game really happy see released alpha backer enjoyed hell alpha bought bought rpg walking simulator attempts pointless combat zero progression want explore game choose going new region rolling new character well essentially thing progression reason invest time single character unless want really big light radius review wont count got game alpha backer people know certainly game infinite progression enjoy good glad enjoy wouldnt bought game known feel like kind lost way game years silent alpha felt way like complete game dont know much play game feels like wasnt even close enough gotta say one unfortunately love game love game fun difficult prevented friend buying game worth state despite great potential starting pros game still many good sidesprosgreat ost music hypnotisingdecent combat systeme requiere bit aim

incredibly empty boring others nice boring run inside hoursfor game repetitive hard bad way dont give feeling acomplishement first hours playingit great potential cant recommend want cube world ever play wait game years cube world want say ive game supporting since beginning coming back game full release heart warming love yes things different maybe people expected game im enjoying im still first region know basically restart move im loving hope creator okay know gets negative feedback doesnt well know want baby though want start fun game world amazing traverse quests fun however combat progression taken massive hit quality almost point fighting anything except certain quest sites progression ever region locking gearmobility artifacts absolutely nothing combativedefensive stats stats upgrades abysmal swimming climbing shit glider riding really dont anything relic upgrade really hope wollay continues update game hopes becomes something walking sim want start stating game much potential potential many aaa games came lackluster content like destiny etc wow game gone downhill preface experience game alpha player since day came following games development past years many others enjoyed alpha immensely putting probably around hours playing many sessions lasted around hours brother friends however noticed waiting months update lost hope game loved wasnt going become constantly teased wollays twitter years later even found playing got bored finally moved onto gamesnow beta finished full game released tell anyone expected anywhere near adventurous exploration rpg hoped could playing today instead feels like wannabe legend zelda horrible mechanics drab movement overpowered enemies sense accomplishment whatsoever rather fun game explore friends go far away lands search challenging dungeons worthwhile loot stuck home region unless want start furthermore many interesting mechanics alpha taken like spirit cubes fantastical upgrades weapons alongside regular wood iron cubes even skill tree allowed interesting ways could upgrade character climb ride fly faster normal alongside slew mechanics alpha amazing teased content past years wollays twitter mostly nowhere found leftover game files would like tell replaced worthwhile system alpha full release level artifacts give small upgrade lamp light radius glider speed swimmingdiving speed increments lamp radius upgrade increased glider speed etc whereas alpha leveled fighting enemies got skill points unlock skills skill tree upgrades artifacts leveling gave increase strength allowed venture world full release experience even exist skill trees taken replaced ultimate move permanently start game cannot upgraded made better way abilities also stay shift ability right click middle mouse never upgraded way staying completely static disallowing diversity games classes subclasses per class equipment bought hard earned gold alpha replaced equipment find world fine realize cross border explore world hardearned equipment taken away goodbye glider boat reins etc rediscover meaningless repetitive quests make walk across kilometers land able equipment hour ago also hardearned equipment weak starting equipment even worse find equipment thing weapons allow leg next regions however far rare work neighboring regions finally point progression system game get artifacts give lackluster meaningless upgrades traveling abilities weapons equipment taken away move next region spent hours conquering difficult dungeon previous land point travel ability upgrade cant even use equipment anymore point game find artifacts level dont even make stronger give special abilities whatsoever point fighting anything moving new region losing stuffin end game changed triedandtrue method experience leveling terms vertical horizontal progression horrible mishmash flawed progression ideas worthless gameplay could rate game today would say nice game exploration fun gameplay fine beat first dungeon find nothing new interesting without starting could rate alpha wollay teasing past years would much closer offering lot content explore fun gameplay infinite fun friends many years come cant get want know played game five hours played alpha upwards hours ill try make simple write prosmixedcos compared alpha general feelings tldr never played alpha give shot wait get mans sky treatment future updates game large shallow puddle wollay trying best give time figure things way works communitypros graphical engine much better runs smoothly map marker system much better like zoom mini map though markers could easier see map maybe add black outline make slightly bigger zoomed quest system works better stumble onto questing way often exploring like use spawn points fast travel points way enemies interesting uses game crafting fun interesting bioms explore intuitive crafting system normally spawns near town give easy quests things unique cube world charm bring lore factions actually reasons talk npcs quests see saymixed xp stats skill trees skill tree whole zone system interesting concept see many balancing issues whole map shown fully generated without need unique seed loot based progressing system really weak start hud simplistic prefer traditional information packed hud goes lot rpg roguelike conventions hud game systems mini map could improve looking like old version functionality new versioncons times feel completely aimless sense real progression loot loot progression system randomized dont map uncover already fully shown clearing map fog makes feel like youre something right lot loot drops wont class loosing mobility items cross zone always especially exploring islands real reason explore beyond bordering zones lot crafting items recipes compared number items problems world gen buildings inside dungeons cross zones making impossible beat spawn locations far making ur walk boss minutes long sometimes bring back old spawn system use new system fast travel points quests marked easy medium way harder start would nice given items craftingweaponsarmor completing quests towns world gen less detailed varied ex tree typecolors town size layout making harder get game way keep track quests real quest lines types quests must haveplz official modding support modding keep game community alive decades take lot pressure community devs community already fix made game better look skyrim stalker minecraft fallout many gameseven flaws would still recommend game someone hasnt played alpha wants experience something interesting fun friends played alpha maybe wait bit new cube world still fun still charm compared alpha feel work progress game breaking bugs lot missingchanged features one would expect rpg roguelike probably due wollay scrapping half game months release great potential though like mans sky needs good team testers feedback dedicated support though updates addresses community issues im going continue play alpha keep close eye gamejust dont hate wollay much hes trying best make vision come true also trying make game everyone likes give room breath im sure hell come back address concerns dedicated community know lot people hating game currently massive changes took place years updates communication devs get pretty clear lot people prefer old way progression alpha standard experience level based system personally still enjoy game played probably hundreds hours alpha like lot people enjoyed new system different dont get xp items used progress move around faster region found exploring world npc telling get artifacts region youre move next one loot becomes obsolete new zone items boat spirit bell found nothing carries new area essentially start fresh artifacts find give small stat increase carry throughout zones however small problem artifacts dont appear increase ability damage duration movement based stats disappointing isnt end worldi major problems find items pretty easily within hours grinding exploring im taking dungeons area system works like rpg essentially traditional rpgs best gear beginning zone help endgame boss game gear still behave like essentially treating new region harder difficulty really major difference games abilities start people prefer unlocking abilities time fine doesnt mean game terrible get startthe biggest problem release game devs explaining much leaving player figure everything works managed figure things quickly others may need guidance totally acceptable however devs gave tips launch beta mob difficulty based color dont think full tutorial necessary controls easy learn better descriptions open certain doors buildings dungeons neededoverall game looks stunning back years ago still plays similarly expecting content years yeah wont lie little disappointing make current content game bad least still lot since havent touched game years feels like brand new experience love game currently look forward spending time know features removed stuff changed think game awesome like remebered know playing fun game know back story game development know happened disappeared said leveling system changed probably worst change ever game needing time release need need people help devs required help finish aspects game regionlocked gear something need help onliterally reverted back leveling gear based level star level item worthless youre fighting level everything feels like level get gear also needs small tutorial taskline give idea everything game offer youre going strings attached gameplayfix theses add game nice game enjoy friends right feels like someone holding something forced release game cube world wanted isnt cube world fans wantedthe game good missing something every game usually recommend developer needs hear feedback get change stuff nobody wanted changed know reviews game mixed lot complaints going around enjoying would love see changes players mentioned classes grinding otherwise willing put current status game awesome give commitment like hours grind beginning little tedious annoying dont good rng game amazing play friends beautiful landscapes defeating bosses almost always drops good gear continues progression area looking fun laid back adventure solomultiplayer game definitely good one looking forward future patches like make game even betterps btw want start game like absolutely broken op make character wizard dps actually dumb attacks fun know game came lot hate however think absolute masterpiece worth time know review one positive id like state didnt play development dont know changes id like start feature bothers region locking gear feel like gear wasnt completely voided whenever crossing regions wouldnt big deal friend finished region started huge hassle getting anything started next going taking highest tiered enemies hard time even damage small beetle next region frustrating personal opinion criticism game id like see small tweak even gear power reduction although seems like huge deal see added otherwise love game ive enjoyed hours game besides one hiccup launched game spawned ocean biome happened beautiful land generation previous version islands small flat pancakes opened map already discovered every ocean biome looks disappointing also happened fish ocean completely dead sincerely hope sort bug like aspects new version im gonna give positive review new version lot flaws wollay doesnt update tweak game goes hiatus update review negative one like get items want go new region also yellow items new region uselessfrom hp dmg add levels make every region harder harder make legendary gear legendary common dplaying friends might make repeating grind fun alone neahupdate found keep gear regions find example iron gloves anything end name like like like like like made yes like like like recommendations community think itll solid game like hope put old skill system game like casting vote ratings like like like know people upset region locking implementation artifact based leveling instead standard experience leveling still thing game great potential great play friends regions still huge plenty explore moving disagree people saying game lacks feeling progression get new armor region obvious enemies fight ones cant favorite part game killing enemies getting new food items using get new pets havent much time play yet update opinion game changes note bought cube world around believe played alpha like sure feel region locked gear kinda makes sense basically enables exploration direction without numbers get bigger like many games feels weird maybe thats ive never seen done beforeive seen comparisons loot based progression games like terraria minecraft yes better youll never feel like lost progress even stuff still gets harder around cube world could definitely still use tinkering department still enjoy purchased back whatever year first offered alpha release son definitely enjoys watching play offering theories certain things way thats makes fun kid name pets decide let using location map visitthat said boss fights dont feel right inability anything damned laser mages gets grumpyi dont know worth bucks fun far hour mark still discovering things like itsure things make game enjoyable like region block level progression game still fun maybe changes would better like bringing back exp system something similar everyone including loved im one people played alpha version changed lot still love picroma hasnt given game like levels customization character debt pet system skills game none exploring game even beautiful graphics weather either day night ambient definetely alpha better like many others waited many years game like many others disappointed game waiting least one waiting game years still feels incomplete xp completely taken game honestly feels like alpha extra bits pieces truthfully large let hopes game think time finally let cube world rest heart game would never like alpha zone lock mechanic shit locking stuff get hours gameplay one zone pretty bad get another zone need get everything get decent stuff game pretty easy progression degression like art style gameplay elements need changed like extrem additions added alpha version love exploration matter far go theres always enemies fight loot collect fun would much like friends get hands try playing multiplayer like game fun especially playing friends sure funyes understand people disappointed due massive potential yet utilized plenty waited years like even though understand negative reviews even less every alpha player even value money nowcurrent downside negative reviews boil lack rewarding progression feelingjust put also right progression artifacts bit climbing speed light radius whatever little bonus time amount feel rewarding sense progressioni think main issue comes simply lack communication last years degree understandable people lacking experience community management sure good gamefixes main issues quite simple good redditsteam posts like artifact skills equipment progression finding example addtional gliders rather unlock region prestige system meaningful levels overregional conflictstory many quality life improvements would get workshop support point ideas community would solve itselfso recommend game simply due reasons enjoyed far every minute hours play time bucks hour fun seems quite fine developer said still wants add specific elements game work thought current state already enjoyablechanged recommended last point statement continued development deleted blogpost leave like see actually like game im going lie would rather turn back like alpha still like im blast friend playing like game much sucks beta game leveling system liked took leveling beast person map really like find like kite boat rope ride pet good game needs updates would good game really nothing far like game endless challenges done whit area move complete area simple fun although difficult understand start give time understand becomes fun lose gear pets items like potions stay dont lose items cant used different biomes found think like dont get bored good armor wrong like game think people dont like comparing harshly alpha havent played alpha benefit going unbiased mind havent bored nice adventure game lot potential also really fun friend like new direction game took beta maybe include old alpha picroma website new players never got play steam like getting games price picroma great games dont take criticism personal steam community hard developers like overall game lot thing dont like region lock thing done prevent happening would great like part game became dogshit years nothing like region locking allows play friends without making new character like region locking quite different alpha tho would recommend game price little bit high think great game overall like game lot like game right many fans know much hope change future like game matter like game although feels like something missing still like like game like game sure else say purchased game way back day ported steami looked forward steam release happy getting visibilitythank work gameit seems bit harder remember enjoy

hundreds hours good game spend dozens like gamenot years agoi still like like timeline like unique gamei think theyll many ideas put itnow theyve established nice base game like update alpha released everyone people would play wolfram remove region locks make separate worlds maps obscured fog exploration thing againgame okay shit better alpha like version game alpha version strongest weapon area doesnt mean strong another area kinda like region lock system however prefer tutorial start kinda hard beginner region lock system shouldnt apply gliding boat well enjoy playing game like liked lot lvl system think region thing dumb liked everything game alpha lacking stuff sure super entertaining gamenow nothing super dumbed version former self main game mechanic relies bdoing thing againb without type progression sure theres progression every region region done theres nothing left bstart absolute scratchb another regiontheres thing gear super rare makes gear also work regions bbut theres way knowing whichbthe things keep artifacts increase utility attributes light slower use oxygen underwater quicker gliding quicker ridingyou level artifacts literally nothing number theres stat increases anythingin short enjoy thing endlessly without kind progression game liked leveling system got keep items thats gone kind ruins whole excitement years game liked loved actually dont feel like playing anymore liked ultimately stopped playing problems regionlocked gear fun game explore find different tools time started new region loved visual design enemies pets landscapes envisioned game would enjoy seeing new landscapes fighting different creatures collecting every pet finding every food etc wouldnt get old really didnt get old got frustrating areas couldnt access get equipment needed access areas couldnt access equipment locked areas realizing way finish region without cheating modding maybe finding artifacts regions eventually getting back one seemingly brokenmy enthusiasm ground halt honestly enjoying three weeks didnt feel cheated felt disappointment enjoyed game could tell things hadnt tested werent likely fixed im sad couldnt continue enjoy playing liked alpha liked alpha played quiet lot like comments suggest beta lot wasted potential cannot recommend liked alpha liked old cubeworld like new one people complain region locking prevents locked friends hop join friends without overleveled outgeared sure isnt convenient system hope skinsaving system implemented still look great favorite gear matter regionlocking takes old grindwithoutsubstance gameplay loop infinitelevel mmo revamps least objectives meaning like playing new legend zelda game yeah yeah yeah yer gna get sword temples yep zelder woah evil ganonesque something youre starting square one challenge onpros combat teamwork multiplayer friendly charming visuals many ways play playerset objectives openworld encourages explorationcons travel options shouldnt reset regions combat fine reset gear travel doesnt need slog bugginess ai lots variety still needs make regions feel truly differentdont go expectations anything like old cube world typical levelbased rpg explorationdriven adventure game fun combat easily worth liked original whatever liked start game continued cant really love like alpha release im little upset whole game got stripped way repetitive zonesbiomes little story get ok dungeons ok challenging wish old skill system kept stats reset move different zonebiome feels punishing rewarding old skill stat system bioms would adapt rather descale user biome overall liked game start didnt get feel alpha right rather would go back playing alpha sorry say wollaypicorama fked overall love cube world played since alpha games dev disappeared selling bunch copies would get torn apart cube world kept playing hoping finally alpha players review bombing game alpha build let explainthe alpha build vertical progression game fight monsters get levels get gear level fight monsters rinse repeat started random world generally hostile creatures travel packs pick fights carefully die things like squirrels seriously squirrels worst beedy little eyes ahem sorry dont know came anyways youd level aimlessly explore find dungeons level get gear die lotthe released version reviewing different beast yeah still die lot dont even think attacking squirrels spent time crafting finding better gear longer level traditional sense vertical leveling swapped legend zelda horizontal progression system talk npcs learn things tackle fights order choose yes find loot gear still vertical progression overall region horizontalthe map structure changed well instead random maps one game map mapnos infinitely big functionally least every player starts different region candy hundreds thousands kilometers apart order play friends join game use npc fly anytime change region gear goes storage start part people issues within rpgs progress new area shiny new gear last dungeon shopkeep boss etc starts feel like old gear monsters increased difficulty force need new gear thing happens except nothing made harder start back functionally serves purpose also means one come region join fully equippedif take game like rogue lite explorative open world rpg works great find plus gear carried well artifacts function traditional levels goal find carry perks next regionall works game legitimate fun get plenty time best friends game tough really breaks stories build along way running forest night accidently finding ogres dying panic friend feet away laughing got agro hes fine right find love cube world progress cut want experience game funi hope changes soon make review positive one love cubeworld lot fun however dislike region locking feel like take game would much better love everything game except region locked equipment restricts true exploration biomes although get permanent buffs region done dont really appreciate swimming speed weapons gear inventory items vanish took step leftgear count false progression prolongs true grind gameits beautiful game good emphasis exploration currant equipment restrictions really irk cannot recommend unless dont mind gear reset everytime want go explore world beyond play friends love game love wollay good game love world looks map game play love love love love expected still love playing love greati probably grow bored month two two days ive played hours feel got moneys worth love love itshure things could changed like boat cross border stay boat get gonesome artifacts options maybe base dps love love love game personal view game dont like shove arse anywayi love fact game actually hard easy kill mobs cant stand move allyou need doge need run actually use potions healing items fighti love every zone harder fact mixed level mobs everywhere kept toes dont get killed yes zone harder making armour worse still better started need work gain better armour thing making mobs stronger except way easier code make way less bugs would loads numbers screen otherwise arent happy change pretend next damage health see literally exact thing problem see game artifacts give levels arent powerful enough think add base damage base health artifacts would neat also removing ways transport doesnt make sense could keep ways transport buff artifacts would make perfect game love playing family learn game mechanics start playing zone becomes fun keeps mind busy hours recommend people watch videos stream see like right different game alpha loving much exploration hope devs add things future love rublox love running around seeing world current way game cant bother working get good gear lose leave zone dont mind high level stuff time run losing gear every new zone isnt id want love sailing spoiler cubeworld spoiler love developer never gave project im really happy continued development nearly years waiting said game waiting pretty much knew gate going like game nostalgia thats still true many things changed removed even game years agowhat going developers head introduced region locking removed old leveling skill tree system game progression aspect stats based weapons enter new areas stats get completely reset ive played three hours im still level goal anymore youre supposed find artifacts essentially replaces traditional leveling artifacts crazy difficult find find increase base miscellaneous stat dont affect combat allthe old game goal purpose gave incentive play theres nothing progression removed almost entirely please please bring back old leveling system skill tree hope developer listen criticism fix game know must disheartening hear feedback fans putting much effort game years hope understandable final product looking said think really cool developer give keys alpha supportersim definitely going come back game region locking removed traditional leveling returnsit would great least option steam beta settings switch back alpha version love artifact system holy crap remove regional equipment add skill tree make infinitely scale want gods sake love artwork overall look game however gameplay live expectations fell short love fact theres life cube world long since updated really appreciate getting steam key despite immensely enjoying alpha version cube world cannot recommend beta versionthe removal xp mystifyingly bad decision opinion used could kill higher level mobs level gear based one remaining quest first zone spawned character hp last mission one npc hp constantly oneshots barely make dent killedso leave zone gear zeroed essentially start scratchi mean cant build sculpt environment cube world exploration add penalties games root playstylewhat remember cube world alpha heading random direction exploring would pass biome biome finding new creatures tame new sites see nights pitch black needed get city find sleeping bag stuck eventually would get lamp lamps different rarity levels specs press f turn lamp youre apparently already carryingi really dont feel magic alpha featurewise gone dramatically reverse thats shame love game waiting dont listen negative comments bum hurt like every rpg play think differences refreshing beautiful game one problem game heavy processor play games light laptop hope optimize game really get stuck well done wollay pixie fantastic beautiful game love game really needs skill system progression without feels

difficult really great experience would recommend especially wollay ends adding better reward leveling love game love game ive playing prior steam release different thats ok easy move slowly explore get strong enough take bigger challenges stuff drop like sack potatoes makes satisfying come back later revenge nothing obvious handed either adds satisfaction discover something interesting feels bit old school love excited play family releasedhonestly easier im sure would enough content keep playing hard time putting love game bought alpha six years ago loved played since game may even put favorite games list definitely would put excited gamesbut sadly version fallen short removal xp leveling system makes fighting almost enemy main overworld completely useless also region locking makes game feel repetitive boring right cannot recommend game keep checking see changes get made changes wollay sticks game change review right twenty bucks worth love game unique mechanics work lot people

immerse order full grab lore story world progression system needs little work comes regional transitionas far progression system goes could work well instead player losing stats enemies become stronger like become etc like alpha instead go would bring back infinite progression get stronger monsters keep getting strongerand definitely lose sailboat glider reins mean wow completely sucks instead turn artifacts upgrades alpha got travel device could upgrade travel devices skill points obtain glider boat etc enter new region find another boat upgrade existing boat like making go faster glider longer mount movement upgrade also happened leave first region without finding boat glider etc always get another regionthese simple changes make leveling completely enjoyable even still find flute harp treasure stone etc every regionoverall game beautiful soundtrack awesome game play actually enjoyable please work progression system good starting point needs little work yes recommend know wollay dev continue working game feels right loved years ago still love nowpros exploration rpg rewards exploring neat locations explore music good great voxel art fun character abilities smooth controls gameplay skill rewarding gameplay easy start coop endless difficulty pet dogcons region locked travel items forcefully slow progress little incentive fight things outside points interest lot walking map fog war weapon customization feels useless fights feel impossible even proper gear single player friendly overall levelling feels unrewardinginbetween dying penalty crafting rarely worth region locked gearedit still stands cannot recommend game developers abandoned still feels like early access loved alpha loved alpha love could improvements sure game still already great absolutely region gives hours gameplay even go slow problem fresh start time still plenty fun honestly confused people play short time get upset start couple hours gameplay hours long max stats would probably lot upset current region locked gearas suggestion think good simple improvement would making travel gear reigns boat hang glider climbing spikes nonregion locked still available region instead artifacts upgrading speed things finding new regions versions would increase speed travel items artifacts could boost base stats minimally instead much game change would allow bit easier travel exploration actually boat across ocean ride border nearest village make artifacts bit impactful going new region personally like weapons wearables region locked give meaning moving region region loved alpha played hours years checked twitter reddit discord updates cube world couldnt excitedoptimistic sadly disappointedthe alpha content game current state region locking gear removing xp removing skill trees removing hotbar removing underwater fights making ocean infinitely less interesting things make different game alpha cube world anymore disappointment game salvageable cant see ever good hoped would current state wouldnt recommend game worst enemy loved alpha game everlasting feeling impermanence towards work beta huge letdown id completely fine regionlocking exploration game artifacts highly coveted actually something make ride pet faster something similar sort change game make work feel like genuinely matters cannot recommend game loved alpha version game played replayed friends amazing game sure needs things added improving gear zoned move different zone core great gamefrom playing alpha version see great things cube worlddont take plebs voting game giving fair review try loved alpha version tried love version instead getting really cool update taking game next level got new game feels like alpha plus game barely anything alpha game feels really empty beaten first biome beat next biome restart zero really annoying play biomes different biomesthe potential game high hopefully fix loved alpha gameplay good thing dont like rastart get new biome understand makes game basically infinite endgame endgame alpha rewarding would even one early game difficult loved alpha definitely like alpha terms progression wish better alpha sadly looks like modding community might able fix major issues people game dont know long last dont think game worth money yes copy alpha loved beta game loved loved isnt even strong enough word describe much enjoyed beta realm possibility apparent start game truly overwhelmed good new game looked like going even better wasnt matter hard tried enjoy first world eyeopening enjoyable felt like original content first reached new world realized different horribly game taken turn wasnt fun anymore exp removed super repetitive thus game isnt would enjoy pains say dont recommend loved game back great still great whole artifact system flawed makes game never big goal little baby steps forever loved original aspect alpha lot changed beta approach leveling gear needs work though swapping areas nothing tiny boost meaningless stats doesnt feel satisfying lot fun however since allows maintaining difficulty explorationmy one request would update alpha nearbugless state allow players revert alpha beta going properties game selecting version want play betas tab way allows people enjoy legacy game maybe add steam multiplayer alpha people dont deal portforwarding loved game hope game developer well loved game first came much potential back reason got changed kinda messy grind resets whenever go new biome shame man damn shame hope change review future loved game first came alpha state love game however agree majority public say newest features arent exactly way wanted new leveling system isnt exactly wanted level scaling isnt great either still love game play even knowing flaws would want everyone else things like alpha beta first alpha didnt reset gear every time went new zone spirit cubes fantastic think need brought back anyway wish say wish great gaming experience loved game loved game become mean like starts get really fun constant state improvement beginning game hard going die often dive missions suited gear improves gets really fun game time going traveling although wonderful soundtrack comes along provides sort peace mind cannot express words travel lands far close different areas begin emerge playing different soundtrack adds gameplay overall would recommend game looking chill yet fun sort game play friends great pick would describe game legend zelda minecraft mix mean said already thousands timesalpha cube world thisi would loved alpha happens dont communicate years learn mean kinda fun problem get lot progress lose mean im enjoying weird development design choices overall still interesting game mean better friends mean yeah sure downgrade game alpha might unpopular opinion thoroughly enjoy game think exploration fun yeah price little steep type content youre getting overall joy play might minority im enjoying cube world stands im type player wants repeat experiences microupgrades equipment basically chasing power level ultimately means nothing due lack end game wanted id play cookie clicker insteadmy goal playing game see every biome offer tackle every combat encounter thats designed appreciate unique builds course tame every pet possible version allows arguably quicker beforeim hours ive conquered biomes time ive done ill likely hours clocked thats money well spent think price per hour compared media like movies etc empathise people want old alpha system back aspects build id love smoosh together create sum best possible happen long wollay isnt dissuade blind rage somecombat fluid skill based aim projectiles think positioning visual aesthetic gotten richer dropin dropout impressively seamless making playing friends easythis im optimistic new improved versions could way miss alpha also enjoy current version come hope see updates future glad supported game alpha cant wait see big things waiting future game interesting kinks choices make feel unique game satisfy players game game enjoyable community developer miss alpha comparing alpha version literally definition chad vs virgin meme wollay really fcked game alpha great dogsht honestly miss old rpg system hoping update instead scrapped favor new loot system feels like thrown togetherthe skill trees ditched large bummer enough variety skill sets enough spells wollay communicated alpha testers missed alpha came cube world prior expectations good game beginning game difficult one careful one shoots cant spray n pray gameyou consider youre region locking gear bit strange surface different traditional action rpgwhen get new area things harder youve got get new gear anyway think need tweaks balance thereyou absolutely lunched mages instanceand would greatly benefit series tool tips popups tutorial new players like rpg action elements strategy youd probably like game want mindlessly mow mobs get best gear dominate rest game probably played aplha really happy beta anounced sadness many players dont like game exploration forced yes also fun items almost go explore nearby regions flow artifactsystem nice design thrills know fast travel world collecting many game works almost explanation like games designed want explore features gimmicks help dummytutorial hope game updated reguar basis dont let hate get wollay keep going need make clear everyone review bombing game developed two people spare time full time job managed still produce quality game unique individual find refreshing people coming romanticized expectations like spent entire years since alpha developing cannot realistically expect pleasedthe actual gameplay maintained enough nostalgic parts loved alpha yet added enough new mechanics make game worth another hours play scratched surface excited explore cube world need preface following unmodded cube world awful installing mods required fix progression system incredibly easy results infinitely superior experiencethe lack proper xp system bit let first experienced progression best safely say im fine early game hell start accumulating power shit hits fan fast exploration entertaining satisfying though whole map revealed start puzzling decision relic system cool well combos effectively various stats gear grant payoff lore entertaining without region lock proper progression scaling move away started cube world everything id hoped would two small changes fix game many ways resulting experience imo ton funnow stuff applies base game dungeons fun explore enemy variety extremely good solid landscapes absolutely breathtakingly beautiful complaints whole map revealed reveal explore segments worldmake mistake developer goofed hard effort community make better makes worth buy honest opinion never knew adventuring exploring beautiful charming world could boring heres proof happen hard sum cubeworld boring game play really comes fact theres meaningful progression game loot becomes useless changing zone zone pets inconsequential character progression barebones cleanly picked bleached skeleton honestly fun combat incredibly simplistic theres nothing worth picking cubeworld gameswant loot based rpg monster hunter world path exile torchlight name fewwant rpg fun action combat system dragons dogma dark souls monster hunter worldwant better character progression literally pick pretty much rpg yes including fallout indepth rpg cubeworld inspite fact fallout minimal rpg elements compared skyrim stripped rpg elements compared oblivionwant cute voxel game content pick copy minecraft download mod pack go nuts personally enjoy ftb infinity evolved current vanilla game still far better never paid game back someone salty money lost fact im refunding game quite gladly game could still become special buy change review game stands serious scam people denial sheer nostalgia nostalgia even defended wollay twitter twice currently game worth price asking worth defence getting never played alpha fun far give chance maybe updates soon never played alpha neither beta dont care disappointed full release game really good need balancing sort tutorial super fun im glad thank wollay never say game absolutely horrible levels gear like trove gear nigh impossible get starting game nominated game storyrich game joke game story oh rich recommend game case youre looking mod changes made steam release unmodified unlock tool traverse world like hang glider boat leash ride mounts even weapons armour get leave region none still available works zone region large theres probably several hours gameplay first region get second walk border new region back square one unlock relics boost base stat everywhere could hours work healthremove restrictions mods like region unlock uarishackstv youll get life set region center move harder things become thatd add challenge multiplayer stretch game bitproblems still exist however lots items pick world cant use certain classes play mage ironcotton balls become useless youre unable use upgrade unlock equipment doesnt tell youll gather stuff cant use time frustrating happen friends play though reduce chance epic drop get sold bugger coins later onit fun need know kind experience youre getting play friend recommend game mods find alpha version game web new progression system ok doesnt really give anything completing region mods change get relics fix see going game sad see fall little flat game still great doesnt really give hr game play hoping beat first region got bored mod game keep going note devgame super fun think needs little work sorry hurts know baby spent years need tweeking needs better rewards relics takes good amount effort get end dosnt feel worth started playing long singleplayer stand point fun thought feelings rng based game fun play game multiplayer horrible system get randomly chosen spawn may turn friends worlds apart eachother another problem game hard start without much information may find difficult level first levels many low level mobs spawn able level fast game become extremely grindy system game promises improves rng style systems spawn difficult mobs around may sound like complaint believe game huge potential become great game right early launch quite appalling disappointing half expectations since initial alpha launch originally came game hearing good things alpha excited wasnt able get alpha met dissapointment game actually released around hours play id gotten first artifact travel new area nothing carries doesnt feel rewarding anything artifact boosts minor anyway theres help theyre eitheri found bored didnt really feel like playing anymoremy final verdict go fucking play trove originally got game back first gained popularityyou know meme skeleton sitting computer thats waiting updates game finisheddo buy game never done say maybe developers one day change opinion instead go play trove originally positive review im changing negative reviewthe good game looks beautiful music great little variety gets old quickly combat seems new skills added nice respawn points great addition game new npc types new creaturespets new buildings quests dungeons etc minibosses lore added game bombs usefulthe bad updates since release fixes mp exploit artifacts next useless zone locking really messes flow game especially using boat travel cant find weapon night time dark cant really anything since cant see foot front forces go town use inn hang glider completely useless making land travel slow npc ai hasnt updated easy get boss stuck tree corridor building etc dont care new crafting system removal crafting items majority community would rather alpha version game back instead current releasethe unforgivable made change review positive negative lose respect wollay pixxie since supporting game first came communication since release single worst thing thing devs could done expected since wollay us past six years deleting blog fb accounts removing planned update website simply amazing leads believe people wiped hands clean game causes also lean towards notion took money ran believe well hear believe update game anymore originally defending wollay mental struggles bullying events listed cannot defend anymore manup dont let sticksandstones get support product simply lost desire even play gamethe uglythe community went one least toxic becoming toxic gaming environments ive ever experienced discord steam forums went shit least reddit somewhat tame sad truth probably mostly adults acting like children platforms people ashamed grow tfusomething look forwardsome great souls making mods change gameplay completely small qol changes devs lazy fix past years hope game continue hands people since devs disappearedfinal notei highly recommend skip purchasing cube world dont reward developers like download alpha enjoy true experience cube world thrown together haphazardly current disaster currently supporting developers like sets bad precedent gamers originally positive review planed game current state cant rightfully recommend cause dont think like playing great alpha still see find way get play patiently waited years hoping game would one day come new content expect entirely different game game design fundamental level work region lock makes absolutely sense place game like game matter personal vary much enjoy game yes things enjoyed alpha game lot charm mu son enjoyed playing vary unique game play unforgiven start challange quite enjoy could use little fine tuning things could improved really continue enjoy playstyle art style many hours come one things miss ran across huge boss would often tear ground leave destruction path made feel really careful personally believe better got course still flaws biggest one progression really existing artifacts seem games main objective dont really help weak make difference somethin easily amended reigion lock good gameplay addition imo makes replayability better players keep boats gliders reins switching regions however overall enjoy game right personally dont like region lock overall still enjoyable especially friends personally like game never part pre alpha initial release game watched many videos streams understand people coming gets old aggravating personally like difficulty aspect game absolutely love new leveling system work progress game made developed along patched bugged total two people great would recommend anyone loves rpg like games course theres still room future updates dlcs thats gets excited dont let negative reviews get keep working pace theres always gonna two sides people dislike game others like absolutely love personally like ingenuity come design ever challenging thing id change little custom ability leveling lore ties world story progressing zones personally really enjoyed even tho first pretty much fuckes ass play fun yikes new update bad dev vanished like issue solve want recommend cant played alpha multiple hours got chars lvl played beta guess share honest opinionwhile alpha flaws considering lvl progression difficultysystem alpha things rightplayers able improve characters using skill points felt like u become stronger u playloot fine distributed early game like lvl felt pretty good u noticed flawsmonsters either challenge nearly unkillable efficient way lvlgrindplay get quest defest roaming bosses reset time againalso world alpha felt quite empty dungeons pretty much always thing changing regions also didnt really change things dungeons looked pretty much every regionthere quests less aimless wandering around creating challenges gothe beta things better gives clear goals lots quests every region world filled enemies strength ranges start fresh character barely beatable totaly possible beat wich great logged first loved hard difficulty game presents youthat progress gear balancing benefits makes game really hard start super easy u got lucky drop time skip white green gear directly aim blue itemsi like aim reset entering new region feel like reset bit hard keep pets good think shoes glider boat carried wellalso id like collect stats leveling gear loose wouldnt feel punishing also provide greater goaloverall like direction beta taking alpha build think way go changesadjustments madeim looking forward great future game played alpha released say liked good rpg game didnt stand much gamesnow year counts cube world finally admit nothing like alpha buying game looked like alpha disappointed however buying game adventureexporing stle gameplay might enjoy iti enjoy new quest system leveling quite unique mean try name another game leveling system one would like see enemy scaling state game either getting shotted basically invincible controversial topic like region locking gives challange got bored aplha hours nothing worthy fight anymore change would love see reins hand gliders boats wouldnt region locked kind kills funin conclusion looking beautiful adventure game endless biomes explore friends would recommend game played bit alpha true game taken strange path although think game still fun played lot alpha cube
