brought friends lot joy bit play beta want support game however giving good review though intention ignoring games faults decide buy game know quirks isnt perfect said lot provide somebody enjoys exploring collecting crafting small amounts grinding class based combat game still going stylei recommend playing friends though enjoy playing solo almost muchalright ill start saying absolutely see lot things people taking issue reviews however lot things changes made alpha build lot us played back people really enjoyed version game included major game changes artifacts zoning jarring due changes spend first hours kind lost totally enjoying however get hang class semiefficient character building fell right back enjoyment satisfaction played alphaaside major game changes also quality life features added game already make worth playing least kind interested alpha things like fast travel flying new key items exciting fun play around definitely consider improvements hoped quality life features would extend past game play like perhaps something could considered tutorialadjacent least controls listed menu like functions keys game zoning classes artifacts town vendors crafting really isnt explained clearly also things like old cube world creator probably changed game released dipped money look past still good game nothing like og still good game ive admired game time youtube videos like finally gotten chance buy try youve enjoyed paul soares juniors adventures youll likely fall love exploration options great im still learning hands time im enjoying moments come ive around game since alpha never alpha copy watched gameplay super stocked game completely different worse though hours one character far basically maxed two areas far think current system might go character might try character types like many people said artifacts pointless hell saying youre level artifact could mean less loot feels awesome though said youre absolutely trash beginning game stars combat defense youre way powerful play mage probably strongest class soon get yellow weapon gg take negative criticism grain salt game gem gem cleaned cut problems could easily fixed beautiful world awesome monsters balanced exciting class system updates could role fixing balancing progression maybe story youre someone willing put hope company dont buy game dont see game left like even opened modding someone would clean ive enjoying journey spend first biome still working atm sort emptiness killing mobs without xp miss leveling pets leftovers drops really fun way yellow lose bit joy knowing red items likely present yellow highest biomes seem rich deverse punch gut leave items longer useful boot boat pet riding dis heartening many new features add alot depth compared alpha questing joy though rng element doesnt always deliver handmade aspects dungeons certainly shine spicing rng worlds addition treasure rooms way open creative enjoyable share game extremely fun crawl freind though alpha fun xp solo cant say would enjoy iteration much alone also different mobs npcs really cool hope anything suppose really hoping rather using npcs meatshields would quests involved teaming like player people dont play multiplayer incentive want play others enjoyed alpha ive fun far problems seems everything biome hand enjoy idea finding creative solutions full great ideas even arent perfect also graveyard saw monstrosities night glowing eyes hulking baddies looked really cool nightshurikens damage maybe highwater mages still strongalso still level hours xdso hours working together brother last hour gained two levels found artifacts first biome moving say though artifacts effects got enjoyable idea carrying things didnt appealing also went new biome got pick whatever gear liked look adventure first degrades armor gear wasnt bad punch gut reins cant live without items dwill continue update play ive enjoying buddy week still like current region lock understand many complains system feeling unfulfilling feels like im going new adventure every new zone go ive looking forward release cube world since word first came played alpha enjoyed definitely fair share problems dev went silent number years twitter updates would start showing year little frequentlyin current state sadly cant recommend game sense progression gear region locked except piece gear randomly rolls allows used regions outside region found utility unlocks sailboat hang glider reins allow ride pet lost crossing regions includes removing boat cross one ocean biome another havent plummeting sky hang glide regional borderthe persistance game minor character boosts gotten finding artifacts world give incredibly minor buffs things like move speed lamp radius etc minimal mean lamp upgrades giving light radius instead radiusi game could great balance changes certain things stands right cant recommend given past state updates communication people initially purchased dont high hopes game receive sort consistant updates currently game still feels like early access title ive playing since alpha yea sure gone changes since questionable still fun friends understand region locking way like rpgs within rpg get friends op current region start new one friends challenge passion project normally would consider customer company considering like ticket experience mans work art might exactly enjoy know statement resonate see side im saying feel ive playing since alpha beta could fun theory even different teasedpromised falls short every mark years development seemingly moved sideways forwards doesnt bode well future game alli wish could recommend thisedit game abandoned surprise surprise ive playing alpha quite written popular tools back regarding server management cube world set proceduraly generated world everything voxel based free explore however game feels repetitive short cant really enjoy multiplayer people since anti cheating measures everything stored localy default control scheme abysmal okayish game hours falls short providing meaningful long time enjoyment ive waiting years sadly seems improvements base level things integral coop rpg present shared multiplayer friendly player summoning sadly current state must tell looking play friends avoid time another year nap ive waiting game last years enjoyed back day soo much fun moment started didnt feel connection witht game lot things enjoyed back day removed world empty back day took hours run around trying get materials get better gear still havent gotten really loved game hoping fall im really dissapointed know might get hate playing hours leaving review cant play need refund hours got alsmot nothing well work real life dont need work free time id like enjoy moment game little bit challange next challange game offers also offers big open world small ammounts everything memories ive waiting game longit wasnt worth wait ive waiting game since waited six years traditional rpg depth skill trees infinite level progression infinite worlds via map seeds originally promised picroma websitethis game absolutely none cannot tell disappointed learn progression ever permanently stays iteration cube world menial stats actually anything make stronger cube world alpha least interesting game loop release destroyed fun game loop made borderline stupid choice depower player daring explore exploration based rpg nothing game matters beyond initial region steamroll anyway get single lucky drop cannot recommend game core gameplay changes heavily current state absolutely replay value beyond initial hours first region even feel great play ive waiting years game come finally changed lot original alpha mostly positive ways quests much better theres much variety interesting things game things dont like much enemies giving xp drop money good drops enough still worth kill another thing im sold region locked items definitely keeps game stagnating think intended tweaks feel like region locking could lot better ive waiting long game played nearly hours beta remarks definitely like challenge beginning basically start nothing hard hell get anywhere items equipment think totally worth region locking system way brutal taste spend much time grinding stuff go explore new region youre basically left started havent played enough see much artifacts stack change difficulty level entering new region im excited see grind takes still good game youre sort thing imo would happy could keep reigns boat glider etc entering new region ive waiting years years play game admittedly saw new alpha version finally come backlash received little scared play didnt want play game dreaming hyping ages actually turns badbut actually think whole exploration factor added fun used sure run around lot gather boat glider whatnot along get good enough gear order actually permanently level stats artifact isnt leveling isnt everything skills strategies good running life things turn south think thats really entertaining ive waiting years game come finally good old releases unfortunately ill give go time goes update review accordinglyfor ill recommend caveat isnt really game previously ive game ever since even loving game major problems devs refuse oppenly communicate community game development ever since people got play doesnt feel like polished product new version major problems well game lacks progression play infinite game cycle hours repeat everything devs tend dissapear took money people almost didnt update people plans future january almost remade game scratch game even genre anymore action adventure game simply play exploration game sake exploration cant recommend people stick game even tho feel could unique fun line man sky ive followed cube world since excited hear release coming steam played alphacube world offers similar experience legend zelda run around slaying monsters acquiring gear items drop gather money healingcrafting items wilderness whacking weapon offers similar minecraft experience moment making character released world without much direction case recommend looking guide someone made community page world wonderful bright vibrant colors daynight cycle gorgeous rotation slow enough doesnt ruin fun reach nighttime takes roughly hour voxel style using small cubes instead large bricks like minecraft appealing exploration great one zone ive explored typical plains pockets forests fun adventure gameplay engaging really enjoy combat figured rotation abilities keybinds similar overwatch working bound mouse buttons others around w key changeable like creatures great ive fair share absolutely vaporized squirrel capable ninja dodging punching disturbing hive hornets proceeded mob punch fists wandering near cult meeting graveyard approaching thought friendly ogre nighttime using lantern classes really nice ive started warrior specialized guardian shieldsword combo gameplay play classes specializations different playstylesthe controversy surrounding game based item progression throwing traditional xp bar experienced games alpha stated earlier ive played lot rpg games need level wow one whopping levels could skip level progression instantly make characters enjoy current content would agree gearbased progression cube world brings better allows start playing game sure issues small nitpicks see easily updated fixed overall play friends sport legendary grade armor gets brought level join go new zone gather artifacts lose upon entering new zone things like climbing spikes remove stamina bar requirement climbing reins ride pet etc armor weapons stats added onto zone acquired simply lose stats entering new zone entirely lose armor weapons like initially thought negative reviews nice way letting play indefinitely adventure definitely better friendsi highly recommend game people like terraria starbound legend zelda diablo minecraft would highly recommend playing friends ive got say im trying best really give game benefit doubt seeing development team lovely couple grew game wanted much developers went hiatus game great idea original alpha phenominal right currently cannot recommend beta simply made alpha amazing unique simply cut betathe removal rpg leveling exp removal blind yet rewarding exploration randomized worlds couldve createdin return sortve mix enjoyable work ethic grindy alpha looteresc leveling system extremely much time consuming inconsistentheres hoping instead dismissing review nostalgia trip release cubeworld realized originally perfected rpg rewards player exploration means steadily improving instead time consuming rng ive lot fun game knowing gigantic game potential im excited playing year hiatus pros limitless adventure literallysimple progression nothing difficultsecrets lots foundcons progression seems artificially plantedcurrently nothing levels earncrafting seems almost pointless almost helpful youve started new region time everything need actually make gear matters except first need quest gives recipe items usually difficult one youd need gear complete anyways almost pointlessoverall lot fun game hoping see wollay game like maybe new classes skill trees etc ive really good time game get changes alpha version take game tons funseparate progression biomes means explore without compromising progress friends coop mode version also eliminates need grinding goal get better equipment randomly obtained quests bosses tackle harder ones battles quests varied fun challenging tons mobs discover lots pets find collect seriously understand fans expecting refined version alpha disappointed reason ignore cube world ive game since alpha wish wollay stuck original ideas updated already place instead stripping best elements continue play alpha hope one day itll get updates deserves ive put thousands hours continue im sorry wollay pixie cannot recommend current implementation matter much hurts ive game early access steam long time great fun play friends explore game changed ive game since first sold taken market game quirky fun first thought would updates case anything game fewer features alpha leveling system tutorial sorts skill trees anymore etc support game nothing money grab made developer rewarded ive invested quite lot time game past days highly recommend game unless issues time management gaming like doi spent hours exploring first zone enjoying every moment regionlocking system could probably use iteration really bad unless youre rushing zone zone anyhow want big bite adventurethats digestible friends easily join onthan cube world game ive invested several hours game completed two regions gotta say dungeons favorite part game overall incredible like zelda game region combat simplistic skill based especially given absence longterm progression continue play happy bought game especially fun friends multiplayer feels much better alpha problem hackersmodders kinda ruin fun kick game current system gear work regions unless find gear good adjacent regions gear thats good several regions levels increase base stats reflecting number artifacts artifact gives stats swimming speed climbing speed future addition combat stats go artifacts adding special abilities artifacts adding rare equipment added affected region lock would good quality life changes gameplay loop hope wollay pixxie continue work game bring refinement current system course programmer understand thats huge undertaking two developers choose continue development bring quality life updates would certainly pay microtransactions cosmetic items nothing pay win pay dlc simply donate money either looking forward many hours cube world definitely recommend game even controversy around new system thanks filling gap childhood beautiful game ive looked forward game long time disappointed turned game great concept vibrant world right cant recommend game really hope developers arent put launch continue work game community feedback mind game great though game doesnt justify price tag youre looking play wait sale wait hopefully improve day comes game good better hoped gladly buy cant justify refunding time ive never much disappointed short period timeill begin positives thingsthe concept really great gameplay responsive game style wonderful graphicsits honestly really appealing dream lots things could happen playing gamelets forget updates developer posted twitter game could seen fair reviewthe progression system huge pile concept could great appealing farm hours swim speedexploration yaaaay boat lets explore ocea boat disappeared farm boat hang glider everytime enter new region interesting exploration conceptwell least like developers communicate well community youve come riiiight place fact wollay never says anything problems pointed community maybe one day hopeso yeah dreaming great possibilities game offer fact transformed nightmares really hope something done game improve actually alpha years ago way much better ive owned game since alpha played years sunk hundreds hours alphathe alpha wasnt perfect fun lot little annoying things funwith hours beta say game still fun sure lot changed better somethings need fixed tweaked alpha build new item system focus equipment good basis needs tweaking exploration focus fantastic region locking needs reworked going new region still really fun finding plus gear feels new musicmonstersquests new dungeons amazing new respawn system great welli hope game keeps getting updated matter many gripes hear fun worth money fantastic base needs polishing ive owned game since first released like decades ago promise youtubers servers life taken sale dev vanished years later started posting updatesthis went sorta okay really bad never lasting potential years could changed somehow made worse expect make game awesome truly think would end like thisi waited years holding onto hope let many things could done went ignored poor features ive paid game six years ago didnt even get lousy tshirt freaking jokethe final game features far far less content thant alpha got rid skill tree crying loud alpha rough edges miles ahead final productive paid alpha access years ago truly excited final version arrive say im mad im disappointed would lie mad confused disappointed publish giant worldgiven beautiful without ability develop charakter important parts inventory purposely reset leave biom boarders kills longtime motivation instantly especially compared way alpha playedif youre contemplating purchase run fast run far bucks bucks much clear regression alpha version gamethe flying anymation scalable map cute though ive played alpha lot liked despite lack content new release opinion garbage new version cube world could really nice game content shuffled much lot things removed instead mechanics etc used wollay added lot non player friendly garbagei recommend buying game recommend wait ant see wollay going fix game hide another years ive played alpha betaalthough alpha beta lack content well fleshed rpg aspects wollays beta version current version steam executed extremely poorly regionlocked gear makes nightmare already hes stacked exploration gear region locked removal skill trees makes progression horrid essentially reset character time move new zonewhat game needs really good tutorialintro phase thrown instructions expected play game fleshed content storylines removal regionlocked gear scaling mobs would betterwollay also tendency vanish communicate community especially viewsopinions explain decided choose concepts ive played nearly hours beta honestly feel deflated waiting years game loved played many years im happy got steam version free owning alpha feel got monies worth playing alpha someone new coming game paying steam id refunding game within minutesenemies hard levelling biome specific itemsall bad bad bad additions game think might go back alpha world weeks hopefully well see wollay listen negative feedback make changeson plus side love map markers ive played since beta launched believe beta better full release game id lying said didnt fun playing full released game id recommend solely visual style alone graphics fantastic voxel style lends well cubeworld bad good things game believe good features far outweigh bad especially price point ive played game hours im done nothing dont buy game bucks even worth half price ive played game hours far lets get one thing straight means bad game different love game hard explains nothing like game like theres hand holding think thing game suffers alpha players players idea play alpha players say game much better progression released version progression goes different view cannot stress enough look things game theres lot wont explain pretty fresh perspective rpgs game getting bashed people arent giving chance rather complain like old version complain difficult theres nothing would recommend game highly ive played game plenty alpha version let tell current state really lackingtons features got gutted completely removed game people got promised back completely different game main problem progression system resets progress every new region went rpg fashioned game roguelike genre experience gained killing monsters thus sense killing running simulator one quest another eventually gather enough information locate artifact yes artifacts way level collect keep bonuses another region seems okayish dont even provide combat stats sailing speed nice memewhile gear taken another region got plus modifier certainly easy find additionally area plus equipment still effective regions heavily limited ranged based circle picked means could range like blocks another region next youre really unluckyin years waited release wollay developer never released update alpha players never responded community however sometimes posted pictures content get added games final form percent proclaimed content even game experience system got gutted january year pretty much made whole new game like months makes sense right really looking id rather wait another years actually get something good ive played game since alpha enjoyed every stage playing game likely put least dozen hours game honestly progression mechanics different games want experience system levels game isnt however love exploration based progression system ive almost completed region game satisfying look things ive completed game starting feel like conquest much area conquer anyway love game definitely recommend ive played game since steam ive probably logged hours game alone lot fun playing friends im glad see make steam worked well ive played game since first came years ago clocked around hours friends blast remember fond times exploring areasclearing dungeonsmobsgetting petsclearing map fogand overall messing around first heard game going finally released steami much hope started playing prerelease version ive let severely game empty shell former self honestly cannot recommend ive read comments agree degree sides pain get new gear fun friend see groups npcs adventuring together thats none subtle hint get friend friend gets really fun soloing opinion fun ive really enjoyed coming back game six year wait like exploration taming pets seeing beautiful sights fun often onesided combat encounters game definitely worth playing shift rpg grindkill enemies game encourages exploration took getting used im completely boardtheres something nice looking map picking locations look like might secret gear placing stars places want see setting see find along way planning routes based gear would faster get boat riding pet makes look world broader sense creates excitement around youll encounter reduces fatigue comes typical rpg grindartifacts underwhelming definitely need better effect ingame whether thats significant boost base stats something else encourages exploration revealing map markers x type location showing npcs talk map marking specific pet random boss locations theyre nice memento ive ive really enjoyed beta felt less grindy alpha new progression systems felt like breath fresh air theyre without problems region region progression definitely feel great definitely speed go zones get resources gear gear works adjacent regionsi definitely recommend game honestly fun sit mates play however id like see progression system expanded id wholeheartedly recommend game people regardless fun beta think people havent played alpha would still enjoy game ive waited years game update let alone come steam came years ago played almost month nonstop many gave hope years ago faith wane though always part believedfast forward years later today finally becoming realunfortunately progression system isnt something enjoy im still happy came doesnt feel like game played years ago still recommend cute style fun exploration though finish first zone may want keep playing still solid hours fun ive waited years wasnt disapointed played beta official game released ive clocked many hours region locking feel extends games replayability whats bad thing theres bugs get patched day theyre discovered thats nice love wollay keep amazing work pixxie ive waited years post reviewcube world timeless classic adventure exploration genre beta could use work overall enjoy ive waited six years fine dont think wait days great title anyone likes rpgs questing exploration try verygoodgame ive watched alpha years ago loved always wanted apart taken play mind numbingly boring empty id rather play trove progression gone game nothing implemented replace think good idea leveling gone skill trees everything rpg isnt also thought people joking region locked items thing insane made think smart rpg suggestion final verdict dont buy game alpha got right alpha rpg elements like many others played cube world alpha expected game changed lot couldve good thing made game better many would agree however game made better many years developers inactive okay roguelikes games progression shortlived might enjoy cube world game little disappointing especially much enjoyed alpha much like many others high hopes game turning quite game region locking happened hope died wanted like game stands letdown fucking love gameeveryone hating honest playing region lock grew region lock system prevents losing quests although similar feel unique fun every hardcore difficulty makes learning difficult fun imho wollay pixxie took money ran threads deleted information deleted basically website disappeared like feeling going release care updating im sad cause really wanted like game despite negativity relaxing game incredible gameplay cute nice like exploremaybe price little lower like everything waited least years aside rendering bein playable tad bit disappointed way renders overall good experience lots less room run around without stick around loading thought typical rpg levels max caps skill system worry quick loop fight gear fight clear dungeons go new land repeat love game friends system doesnt sound appealing may wanna steer clear one absolute best party play games ive ever played friends easy join together go new region basically enjoy condensed mmo regularly play eith people fact hours least coop partner like playing mmo together without needing grind end game wait queue dungeons stuff party friend friends anytime gear together kill dungeon hours youve got mechanics downthe combat fast simple learn fun master definitely recommend cube world heres link first hour start warrior class character enjoy honest trying play game played alpha years excited game finally came steam quickly found current version nothing like alpha relearned game played span weeks gathering everything getting new high level gear decided go new location put way back started every mode transportation items removed found quickly whenever enter new zone gear put back lowest level need full set gear zone get bland quickly assume game much fun friends everyone spawning separate location find city fly single location luckily free however take large amount time depending spawns feel like changes made sake innovation rather fun wallay put years life game working wife thank even issues running around friends amidst pure chaos fun worth issues people still fixed get could still get alpha would recommend game playing new version hours went back played latest believe better xp loot skill progression go back alpha focus adding content systems interact one mistake seen many times early access games creator release really cool experience great reception change drastically original vision instead expanding made early versions struck gold trying make something perfect already exactly needed much appreciate creators attempt deal issues shouldnt completely reworked game lot fun playing latest alpha moment im level warrior riding camel desert couldnt even kill anything new version wollay removes region lock items adds appropriate scaling better stat boosts artefacts games new levelling system fresh fun breaking mould traditional rpg levelling systems grinding enemies etc whole artefacts level idea intriguing executed poorly nominal stat boosts per artefact fixed fantastic system based exploration creating fresh dynamic experience however case right recommend buy game yet fixes patches come game superb worth money anyone tells get game get anyway probably beautiful chill yet action packed game play admit years kinda long also well worth wait need remember one person made entire game loved alpha version much better people need calm stop giving negative reviews wait changed current version alpha release new buyers would think impressive update leads believe current version sharted means publish game steam enough changes alpha wasnt simply rereleasing obvious cashgrab yet still blatantly cashgrab makes question development done additions strange gimmicks nobody really cares like mage able float npcs giving quests lore etc changes alpha arent additions near wholesale awful b dont buy dont support dev b doesnt come back worth unless mod takes someone defendexplain game fun provide guide make fun probably isnt fun game games like dwarf fortress need guide understandmake fun simple minecraft inspired adventure game shouldnt hard get intousually alpha time listen users bugs features likedislike etc maybe form roadmap achieve something based input ignoring everyone making game want play end game probably want play progression alpha felt slow start progression beta nonexistent converted skill trees dust deleted sense true progression kind leveling relics boost minor movement stats reward hours dumped dungeon crawling gem crushed dust like dreams fans mixed button id use iti fun version alpha incredibly flawed recommend different type person would recommend alpha wasnt region lock would give positive review real couldnt stick original plan add excited game come alpha much promise road map exciting exactly looking earth would add region lock small biomes preach exploration yet punish wants running randomly get dismounted earth would want quest get rains every time want leave biome doesnt work dont understand could posibly think could wolfram von funcked game bad reintroduce leveling system make feel like actually progressing zone reset progress would play recommend right repetitive easily updated needs alphaid recommend wait major update remakes game back alpha years ago would happy things currently isnt yet want believe time devs wont disappear without word communitys requests taken account im leaving positive review want encourage dev continue working game think currently great game u liked alpha cant promise u like talking alpha version would completely recommended itbut really feels like neutered version fun things loved game gone granted add quality life features content content doesnt mean better game everything terms actual gameplay made unfunit really shame ever fix game id happily jump back onboard looking forward years thinking buying game would recomend finding mods like first buy mod actually super fun xp progression mods came alpha extremely disappointed new game dont future expectations updatewise grab saleif plan playing alone definitely get saleif plan playing friends worth full price didnt play alpha friends remotely interesting didnt play alpha honestly recommend game due popular belief ive enjoyed hell game although changes werent best game still enjoyable didnt play alpha maybe youll

execution making feel hours still level barely halfway completing region system new exciting experimental bucks definitely get moneys worth tell plenty room grow game never played previous version cube world please read reviewthe reason reviews mixed lot players played cube world alpha version unhappy state game release level progression system changed since alpha well gamechanging factors ultimately expectations high suddenly droppednow let review game somebody never played cube world prior purchase days agothis game interesting leveling system yes region contains least one artifact get exploring region talking people obtaining better gear artifact gives slight upgrade something level progression gear doesnt transfer regions meaning start grind lot fun enjoy unique system game follows system definitely everyone though another aspect game enjoy exploration exploration forced thats would expect open world adventure game exploration game opinion done well never get bored wandering around could hours adventure scenery game gives truly magical appeal puts positive mood mention game best map function ever witnessed game conclude game magical experience full superlative adventure hours content level system different difficult get used offputting reviews game try let change viewpoint game since lot biased towards previous version somebody playing game first time absolutely recommend game looking exciting adventure havent played alpha might like joined recently game fun challengingif youve since alpha keep complaining grow start playing find hard situationlook

personally lot fun combat system insanely addictive would enjoy purely combat focused experience wait sale get game currently nothing offer youthe things opinion would fix grievances game areremove region lock equipmentreintroduce exp system alphaadd artifact effects type end goal like exploring explorings sake simple combat questing allows challenge reward abilities explore impunity focus cube world truly massive amount lands exploreif dont enjoy discovering small things like respawn beacons crazy cave networks wandering roads forested hills dont bother really focus game entire make like grinding repeat reason grind progress grinding reset reason game anyone else move along nothing see like kind proc gen game youre always excited see whats around next corner next hill game absolutely worth twenty bucks region gear thing pretty much exactly like leveling mmo gear date soon move zones without pressure gear able play friends id rather get new gear time spend hours trying find perfect piece liked cube world youll like however im recommending game feels game went forward steps went back classes subclasses much fun play game boring skills always available real progression build artifacts much gamble artifact got meter boost lantern radius important part rpg dev added much new better content game yet obliterated core loop something makes want quit complete region bought play didnt wait progression fixed liked alpha youll like core gameplay stable loop zones fairly short need progressed relatively independently worth money spent years ago love mobile games love played alpha hours honestly say version better see paper new system sounds great way put game seems like development weeks every region enter last game needs least years development even close fully finished right worth picking around dollars current price worth seems like game still prealpha type stage games worth money waste loved enjoyed exploration adventure sense progression cube world knew years ago beg youbdont buy gamebwell dont buy iyeti isnt game loved years ago version cube world completely butchered exploration aspect game regionlocking gear get region forcing start pretty much scratch every time move region borders enough make anyone put game old fan new fanthis version also completely gutted sense progression got alpha version skill tree even uentire leveling systemu removed skills unlocked getgo makes sense rpg get levels collecting artifacts provide minute nonregionlocked buffs character topic characters seeds worlds cant generate world video explains thoughts clearly url things change review stand negative played alpha enjoyed beta basically game without everything made game fun hopefully another years waiting game worth money spent played alpha enjoyed likely wont enjoy thisif want kinda cheap kinda fun game play maybe kids sure start reading review please read whole thing played alpha version bunch friends cousins years ago absolute blast amazing game especially alpha version high respect wolley choice take time develop game private time severely disappointed played friends cousins barrowed account time went buy one shop closed anxiously awaited release full cube world finally announced could hardly contain read reviews crushed game seamed like absolute crap everything enjoyed alpha gone replaced abominations like region locked equipment bought game see found true game completely changed initially extraordinarily mad playing hour two found still good fun game cube world alpha simply two completely different games cant compared would like judging apples flavor orange game looks amazing simple yet fun versatile combat system love quests dungeons blast go trough overworld super fun explore region locked system means always equal terms playing friends could start new adventure anytime wanted go back old one great game price would recommend especially friends play still many things miss alpha honestly think could released two separate games allowing mod support game would also hugely beneficial opinion still alpha game much better game think game anything like alpha youre kinda right mostly wrong game looks nicer gameplay lacks progression fun play current state want polished robust version cube worlds alpha gameplay wont get vanilla want skill trees experience dont buy gameif want try new game new experimental progression mechanics development guestcube worlds current version vastly different game previous self progression completely different far experimental design skilltrees experience enemies scale wanted cube world old might keep waitinghowever big fan cube world wait customary years enjoy fan mods add various features much requested community distance based regional gear want brainless grinding work towards goal doesnt exist work mcdonalds dont buy trash want explore interesting world gear based progression might like gameunfortunately rpgs like level spend skill points interesting options gradually get stronger take tougher tougher enemies gear based route youll go ass handed pick decent weapon point youll instantly start destroying everything none sounds bad might like game people like id stay away want play game youre better cracking alpha version want play game recommend sticking versions arent steam theyre much better chill devs bring speed want preserve love cube world alpha stay away version took away best parts want spend hours trying figure survive actually thrive first zone load leave zone progress gets thrown window heres game game nothing like old version good way im change case change bad makes progress game pointless ultimately making game pointless want support dev ran away like years ago feel free support himbut everyone else got head still buythe hole game got many problems fix game seen update long timeso better reporting game steam save hard earned money ever enchanted old alpha release cube world long ago waste time thisnothing really added since original early alpha release six years ago perceivable changes build back vs removal content fact im disappointed despite expectations beyond already played back speaks wonderslook scam wollay played us like fiddle hes stolen hundreds dollars loyal following hes paying mortgage mansion type review like many people feel betrayed youre fan roguelites type constantly make new characters mmorpgs like game youin new version cube world world divided regions gear used within region exception rare plusgear also used surrounding regions artifacts obtained end reward dungeons give slight boost noncombat stat permanent combat music world generation cube world great well think wouldnt enjoy progression system probably pass youre older player coming back experience game fully finished youre gonna completely disappointed nothing like used youre looking continuation alpha isnt game drastically changed worsethat said tried enjoy hes done game plain funthe feeling exploring huge open vast world full unknown completely gone none planned features website implemented youre looking fun rpg youve heard ruined spend money something else youre looking buy dont game going waste space computer matter size game may bethis game great potential alpha years development little communication dev stripped life become soulless husk couldve great gamethe game anything like used wish could type good thing leveling system alpha completely gone thing matters farming crafting higher tier gear point less moment finish everything region wanna explore againyour gear become completely useless leave region like putting starting gear spawned making waster another hours bullshit grind dying multiple times maybe get drop enemy boss within gear rangethe fun game alpha level get anywhere upgrade gear leveling actually rewarding exploring run hit move need wonder skill youre gonna unlock next kill walk miles next objective achieve nothingtldr game bad dont waste money potential alpha drained life hope update adds features game worth price youre thinking buying seeing videos alpha gameplay dont entirely different almost nothing like alpha essentially running around trying figure hours finally realizing need quests anything realizing need cheese every boss extremely top gear cheesing high level enemy losing everything youve gained moment travel far save money fixed likely wont youve never played game remember watching videos game wait sale game fun enough lose track time theres enough hold months end game great potential wollay one person dont expect game updated constantly youve played alpha game years ago chances wont enjoy game current state biggest problem game sense progression almost completely stripped alpha could level put points towards different skillstrees use certain gear youre high enough level admittedly even system gameplay extremely slow beginning elements removed however longer feels like control interaction come across enemies way strong start cant even cheese experience rare lower level encounters youll end avoiding enemies encounter removing combat viable source entertainment ive told friends talk townspeople go quests special artifacts gear seem worth given fact items underwhelming giving stats lung capacity underwater items also region locked could good thing finding godtier gear set rest game take fun however current system work especially frustrating multiplayer friends may find something useful spawn literally km away surely wollay come system fitting thanossnapping inventory every time cross bordertldr shear amount game mechanics changed worse discouraging often make game feel like walking simulator action rpg game hopefully much criticism game receiving rn wollay make changes current system revert back elements worked alpha game disappointing worth timei cant recommend anyone current state youve played previous cubeworld back youll find game alot different worse lots positive changes opinion couple changes left experience ruined took xp leveling talent trees gear use zone sure infinite content whats point restarting every zone changes right going demise cubeworld opinion course take however want slice cake like watched video years ago dungeon crawler cube rpg skill system game looking ignore hate people obsessed alpha game amazing short simple first time ever playing cube world blast friends personally love idea resetting itemsgear moving new areas feels refreshing start new exploring learning game works one fun partsgood job wollay keep ignore people hating saying alpha better alpha fun minutes progression playing hour could done game beta added tons activities wollay needs address stuff like gear transferring zones artifacts much game lot fun friends playing solo far perfect main issues community brought fixable ive put hours beta past week fun ever alpha ignoring massive dissapointment alpha current cube world potentialwith impressive procedurely generated content would innovative exploration system game could something write home unfortunatley cannot reccomend game anyone state butthurt fan player broken beyond beliefe randomized drops lead roaming world hours searching better gear lot bugs unstable build horrendus frame drops dungeons need massive reworkings around progression system make feel worth exploringof course butthurt fan think arguable game deserves another chance given waiting years perfect product came broken alphain end product cannot recommend cube world right good proof concept things come alpha years ago steer away fixed ijust cant recommend current cube world much really want im alpha player feels like stray away vision alpha hoping helped steam multiplayer even terrible mess im diehard fan since played hundreds hours simple breakdown new version cube world nostalgia exp system removed skill tree removed region locked gear one baffles region locked extras hangglider boat pet riding etci really fell love original game friends week trying game without progression system felt shallow boring really enjoy sense progression rpg one lost wayits back wait list although see people started making mods remove gear locking system im enjoying game im gonna chief game current state fun besti like got lads play blast im great time gamelove co oplove work required find gear character work required craft gear items rnglovely worldbright colourfulunless nighttime dungeon couple things dont like thats find boat glider every new regionthats major issue tho overalli say give chance might actually enjoy itand read gear design game dev put place reading checking form opinionme personally like enjoy contenti playing time come im fun im hours gameplay must say im fun enjoying game im one rare people likes region locking like starting fresh every region would make artifact bonuses significant rewarded completing region example add artifact vitality give max health artifact strength gives well damage problem region locking finding boat reins harp hang glider every different region would make biome unlock example find boat jungle every jungle go maybe scatter traveling items throughout regions biome makes sense also

samethe old skill tree system scrapped replaced nothing thats thingmany rpgs way offer suggest waiting years developer actually finish gamehey atleast got free current state really fun hours wants quests region loot based progression doesnt work isnt fun current state cannot recommend game core game lot potential current state wonder developed last years alpha much better game opinion current state game enjoyable like alpha trust developer hope changes things game mechanicsso ill give positive feedback mark esteem im sure game amasing game one two updates current state theres really enough content make want play longyou get artifact great glide slightly faster wow took hours get point start scratch againno thanks give something useful artifacts make worth grinding like run speed attack multiplieralso add workshop let people make thingsalso whats deal stealth game completely useless first attack dont kill one hit whats point stealth allmage warrior good choices especially coopalso tell us passive effect icons meanand let us know pet requires food without us google current state theres lot missing game lacking lot want waste money still go buy something else anything reallyupdate decided mod game removed region lock enemyweapon scaling like old alpha also better stats artifacts makes useful better mod game change mechanics fun game thats good game mod actually enjoyed game bit recommend wasting money current state game literally unplayable actually kinda funny years ago abandoned cube world far enjoyable seemed polished half hours play time got special items something never described wasnt able get gear mobs around high level even wanted fight cant damage even one level say havent able experience starting scratch zone ability run little faster sucks see game always wanted kid turn way hope get better though uncertain terms recommend game anyone put hundreds hours alpha back unimaginably excited game finally announced release six years twitter update teases thought going amazing additions game instead got shallow experience possible game entirely less features alpha build released six years priorprosthe music niceteleporting shrines cool guessconstowns villages wholly uninspired seemingly coherent layout npcs constantly run wallsthis game rpg levels exp gain enemies scaled classic scale difficulty green weak purple yellow strong matter strength every enemy almost assuredly one shot youterrain generation absurd fog war keep guessing whats beyond horizon look anything anywhere map time theres surprises visually see castle across ocean mapregion locked progression starting new character less equivalent entering new biome gear vanishes good luck hanggliding certainly fall death cross another zone unless get lucky rare dropped gear equipment also useless find everything thing keep artifacts give like buff diminishes additional biome explored skills upgrading skills removed outright fun spamming ult hiding tree kill stuffevery quest iteration go kill everything quest log varietyi marking review received free paid six years ago cannot recommend game anyone like paying new car waiting six years repair cars frame thing get back ive bamboozled last time year silence many changes made game though changes shown looked incredibly promising end result trips falls incredibly flat lack experience points deincentivizes players fighting lowlevel enemies attempt get stronger region locking gear deincentivizes players branching different provinces looking rare artifacts artifacts giving relatively useless stat bonuses deincentivizes players actually completing dungeons reward borderline insulting progression meant make player feel strong visiting previous undefeated foes vanquishing swift blows felt satisfying area copypasted preset dungeons large empty map meant never knew youd end next whole map shown effectively ruins explorationi understand attempt continuous stream content end game gameplay stays fresh new attacksspells learn incentive actually play game explore feeling reward progression everything gameplay start end feel like choreone thing ill give game multiplayer built seamlesslyon another note base specs run game entirely changed since alpha game cannot run lowend systems whatsoever due poor gpu optimizationwollay back ignoring criticisms game keeps id stay away game wait big sale nowhere near worth current stateif want experience best still flawed right version game download bootleg alpha online works multiplayer steam release cube world progression circular meaning wind right back started go new region gear gets hefty nerf stat wise take region found reverted normal brought back home region gear icon travel slightly without degrading degrade like normal gear given enough regional distancepermanent progression earned collecting artifacts stay character forever give boost stats related exploration boating hanggliding diving etc lamp buff artifacts add meters additional light radiusthe opinion part enjoyed playing latest version cube world bit time went found less less entertained game progression loop didnt hooked long comparing alpha game seems shorter less robust content wise found overall disappointed game went years cannot personally recommend gamefinal verdict like see buy dont dont beginning wasnt really fully enjoying cube world felt hardly able progress character first hours quite attuned playing progression system cube world gear based progression system many games like games also player level meaningful impact character stats abilitiesskills cube world skill trees level affect character dont get xp slaying monsters level proving worth lighting fires temple power locations slaying powerful monster level character means lot less adventurerpg games strength cube world entirely dependent gear took time get comfortable accepted started playing rather system started really enjoying fact dont mindlessly kill npcs gain xp progress great thing focus exploration avoid unnecessary combatin start game character quite weak common white enemies dont drop good gear either realized reason progressing slowly set right priorities starting second character found fastest way progressing early crafting freeing trapped trader gnomes world quests fast possible depending class need different materials crafting starter gear warrior run straight nearest mountain landscape mine iron ingots hunter find plant based fiber near forrests trees youve crafted start white green color coded quests progress quickly many criticize game region locking gear get think neat feature get gear drops zone carry zones depending kingdom attuned dont start every time change zone kept two yellowgold gear items first zone blue lvl gear level went adjecent zone dont start every zone drop power bit ive changed zones three times think actually good mechanic means fully complete first zone god figure essentially still challenging zones also means change zone whenever want without enemies lot stronger would force progress within certain region moving really feels like open world sense go anywhere progress fairly taking away means fast travel riding sailing gliding zone dont really mind youve moved zone easily fly around eagle every town want go something wont afford first zone ways traveling second zone start convenient anyways fly items pick think game great game lot charm progression curve makes exploring zones world fun fair id honestly like seeing system open world games beginning game pretty difficult understand play pretty fun current state cant recommend really loved cube world youre gonna exploration rpg game remove skill points punish exploration region locked gear cant surprised community taking well ive done two regions im already exhausted game feel like im never progressing meaningless nobody cares swimming speed current state worth playing current state game cannot recommend purchasing way game works explore zone completing quests gain gear searching legendary artifact hidden within zone unlock different travel tools example boat hanglider collect respawnfast travel points within map find artifact learn makes lantern grant additional meters light go next zone unless lucky get gear weapons armor try sail next area boat longer works either biggest flaw game right may well make new character soon get legendary gear worthwhile reward continue exploring within hours fully geared wandering around hoping npc give quest instead telling cool armor waited years game release instead getting improvements game stagnated lost features current state game isnt fun put endless hours alpha solo freinds loved itbut progress reset whenever go new area fun plain simplealpha fun enjoyable experience state game right wouldnt recommend getting game potential amazing really great exploration right game consists completing areas map basically missions sense progression getting small buffs meaningless stats dont need way getting small buffs completing region take around couple hours complete complete region continue next items pretty much useless meaning dont carry important items help travel map thats pretty much entire game story sense progression nothing couple hours entertainment thats figure even start like said earlier game potential something amazing taking step wrong direction hope helps time took alpha wollay perfected world generation algorithm forgot originally made game good decided make completely different game people like games current state dollars maybe hour hmm different rest regret suggest look serious critique cubeworld honesty pretty much hit bullseye dartboard alpha content fun new game name cubeworld dont expect much exploration sandbox fun youll quickly find finishing first zone get repeat exact thing gear although brought new regions applicable surrounding region aquired making fairly useless leveling useless exploring fun sometimesi look forward updates going need iti enjoyed didnt hard say honestly fun soul suckingly boring points incomplete game loving community ignored developers recently silenced giving feedbackif continues happen game still boring unsatisfying overall wasted potential promised much years later nothing show wouldnt mind sold ip company work game get rid wollaypixxie development process game might become something next something even terraria minecraftif really wanna try game potentially refund get feel new player experience im certain like insane game lot fun need updated rly instead fleshing fun wollay removed best mechanics somehow even managed invalidate exploration something personally loved alpha cute fun good good game better cube world alpha yes good game well almost currently major thing needs fixing far im concerned progression like game going artifact system lantern radius hours playtime really would like see skills subclasses content etcoverall core good needs fixingup different alpha yes still good yes im enjoying thats counts meedit changed negative abandoning game immediately publishing steam going dark like jack bauer shameful playable yesis wanted nocould better yesis dev coming back nois worth money nothis game isnt actually bad tiered equipment enemies bad way progresssing dungeons good get complete set star gear somewhat challenging times game really fun considerable amount dothat finish everything region move next region lose special items boats hang gliders etc items reverted trash tier get keep items stored separate tab specific region work move back region use completely removed desire carry playing progressing well enjoying game im punished exploring one key aspects game also invincible troll pretty fun needs work beta game good state however reason people think lot people blame region locked gear reason game isnt could wrong core game cube world amazingly designed real primary issue artifacts items level character grant utility bonuses like breath time lantern radius transport speed doesnt work combatcentric game permanent progression especially regionlocked modes transportif artifacts nonlinearly ie straight stats combat related cube worlds state would improve hundredfold even problems could wholeheartedly call great game good news wollay likely make changes aspect game still recommend still quite novel experience impressive automatic generation release version steam different alpha yepdid developer take unique approach matching zones players yepare ton cool ideas could enabled game yepdoes make released game garbage nopei spent months engrossed alpha years ago im speaking lack experience played beta daily week hurt sit played painthis good game game game alpha nowas alpha version game years ago yesi dont think looking game standard rpg experiencewollay wanted make game different opinion great jobthe game works locking items specific zonesin one zones find everything need great playthrough owni understand frustration lacking progression zone zonethe artifacts arent great completing big dungeon doesnt feel rewarding opinionhowever want get enjoyment game highly recommend teaming friends conquering zones time way enjoy multiple playthroughs different biomesits like starting new terraria game except instead loading new world cross border whole new zone awaits like cube world flaws cut wollay slack made game pretty much himselfand think pretty great job really fun friends alone hardhopefully well soon get updates easily improved changed lot since alpha still like lot focused exploration questing could great game hope wollay updates game time like sometimes doesnt give lot go know incredibly fun game little repetitive fun feels like lot stuff removed see dont think bad game means leveling system might seem dumb think provides incentive actually explore lands go gear cannot taken lands could could sweep map go straight artifacts level think game many cool mechanics think see wollay trying think come game cant wait see updates future feels like working towards nothing gets repetitve quick losing ability ride mount enter new region makes exploring new regions bother good great add description pet food pet food didnt describe used pet interesting developement say little bit scared first due various changes example xp anymore level finding artifacts dungeons strength increases gear lose progress leave land without completing first also motivates lot one region find npcs town game gets going get quests find interesting locations loved game years ago want love today update review time goes see turns lot issues mostly terms balancing difficulty balancing loot fun mod theres amazing mod lets use equipment tools anywhere makes game really come lifedo hope fix issue cut content absolutely hope eventually fix lot design issues way keeps game feeling immediately bland soon get relic yes hope add skill trees players pursue definitelyits recommendation solely soundtrack atmosphere mounts gameplay general control scheme etc feel really good perfect game even closeget mod play friend good timeheres hoping gets patched improved lot potential meeting satisfying quotas music gameplay story mechanics yet hope future updates bring glories behold changed alot since alpha believe still one fun games ive played quite less content charm years development mind blowing alpha enjoyed thoroughlya great game taken progression entirely gear biomelocked character gear based get unlucky spawn take hours find first town anything help die enemies encounter honestly glad got code played better game would pay save money different game good game hit ground hard progression goes pattern difficulty high starting makes people get drawn away start become strong make super fun absolutely destroy things would shot beginning getting artifacts region buff stat permanently catch artifacts affect combat affect useless stats swim speed stamina climbing also transfer another region finished one good equipment brings equipment star removes utilities thats community upset game finish region restarting game new character hope dev wollay fix game live reputation alpha good game things make people cry first people dislike change get used new region locked gear artifact system becomes pretty fun balancing issues especially start game hard time dungeonsofcourse dislike fact removed exp traditional levels game lot potential good already game promised game different therefore backlash first wollay fixes balancing maybe adds back kind skill tree traditional levels really nice give game potential become future lets take easy hope wollay might fix things lets hope player base also matures bit sidenote people freaking way much calm good game fun exploration game worth price good game pretty fun aswell fun game region locking system items sucks wonderful game enjoy finding many different fantastic things never seen always sad experience see game going something enjoyable entertaining actually good something piece shit cube world alpha amazing progression depth felt amazing explore world current state play region leave literally back square one gave new version shot tried enjoy really bad save time money avoid game like plague best cube game better alpha see people complaining zoning systemi remember playing alpha getting certain level enemies become easy mode easy new zoning system doesnt matter strong first zone move next gear reset making hunt loot rewarding personally like iti think version far better alpha good work worth wait definitely worth hopefully continue working make even better fun iq fun beginning kinda boring needs update play fun modded allow progression like game used also remove unnecessarily tedious issuesbetter friends suretoo bad leveling skill tree removed feels like already everything start game fun play start get biomes becomes really boring really quick thing fight boss get gear change biome repeat great except small problems one thing dont like u specific weapons biomes think u able use weapon ever u go everything else pretty good far nice closure unfortunately isnt anything like direction game going alpha long term progression movement speeds yes lame everything else reset enter new regionthe main idea see trying make region sort largescale dungeon similar zelda get map compass dungeon regain navigation tools reupgrade shops things pretty interesting idea im actually onboard execution poor theres nothing rewarding definitely think could worked needs large redesign concept fun play game years ago much less content feels unrewarding dont let nostalgia take hold worth price tag really hard recommend recommend game looking game feels complete full content replay value recommend especially buy game expectation significant changes updates beyond bug fixes also ingame help need find tips getting started guides get brutal unexplained early game ultimately recommend game reasons people going expect complete game game enjoyable things well becomes stale quickly motivation continue exploring new regions see new biomes world gen fantastic except oceans opinion explore new areas deal losing gear tools hang glider boat reigns riding pet etc exploration hindered slowed grind gear upi dont hate direction wollay took game could accept regionlocked gear incentive keep exploring new areas artifacts highest rewards region feel rewarding simple utility boosts like letting swim tiny bit faster lamp illuminate tiny bit furtherultimately recommend educate decide current state game worth dont mind grinding gear seeing beautiful world gen go ahead get enjoy otherwise follow game check month two see changes made developer given indication seen criticism plans explore changes improve areas community thinks lacking fun friends online also game fun play friends well good really enjoy playing especially friends isnt good isnt quite yetthe game lacks rewarding feel efforts feel vain especially region locking experience systems games past great seemed one draws many people play entirely absenti highly respect wollay pixxie dedication work put producing game however game much lacking core elements needs keep players playing missing ones make game enjoyable rewarding throughout progress pacing slow draining taken away user moves next zonei hours game find hard encourage keep playing even time invested feel progressed nowhere new player would likely appear advanced wasnt good repetitive gear region locked really progression progression game minimal sometimes get lucky within minute youre late game progression system region locked gear games fine gets kinda boring pretty quick kind sucks gameloop boring repetitive seems built artificially prolong gameplay alpha better ways also bad would recommend buying wolly steal everyones money ran last time looked like good game friend showed alpha game still looks nice fun friends meh looks like minecraft plays like zelda breath wild felt like weapons dont breakthe games focus exploration world appears infinite really easy play friends ask flight master send seconds later protip press space bar steer hang glider otherwise landing might rough drops way theremonsters come grades star stars gear needed defeat themin zone youll collecting items work specifically zone pay attention end item name items relatively rare work areas theyre valuable even theyre worse currently havethe game expects fully explore one area go onto next gear items really help dont start zero second time aroundsome fights tough easier friends theres crafting relevant endgame theres chance learn crafting recipe two gear every areathere cute environmental puzzlesthere many pets ride help fightsthe problem starting difficult carefully pick fights dont attack anything stars gear manage youll die lot theres real penalty fights zergable friends spawn point nearbyoh speaking pro tips spawn points see one shrines run press e play tune shrine marked map blue dot click dot anywhere world get teleported difficult figure beginning obvious save frustrationyou notice mixed reviews game got review bombed people played alpha prefer old numbercrunchy progression made every zone explore first rather irrelevant like way better theres less math less obsolete contentone last tip whatever class end playing try different weapons make big difference offering interesting attack modes timing tricks may repetitive goal involved still fun run around friend two kill time sure leveling system anything stats kinda gone thats alright im certain eventually updated future better include content may game wanted still enjoy day may live hype alpha even fullest potential god dam game good fun relaxing might like originalit might best game hopeless causebut fact edit game mods makes game hopelessat core really nice game assuming dont cheat spam items stats fly something play game used game great waywith region unlock mod scaling enemy difficulty game great nothing else really neededthe one thing make game better though make sure friends xdthis games enjoyment goes play friends adventure game sucks getting ambushed open world game xd good really amazing idea make game rewarding point clearing anything first region really pains write review waiting long playing much goesthis game shadow former self could stomach playing hours im die hard fan cube world general played since waited several long years actual release recommend game anyone wanting experience alpha hadwollay changed lot lot really things expect xp killing monsters lots quests although quickly become repetitive im already sick rescuing gnomes witches cultists region locked equipment probably controversial change sucks limits progression also valid boats gliders reins forcing stay region even artifacts increase useless movement speed stats dont even work find special items region unlock certain locations necessary progress inside region found tthere bugs though sometimes may find one items region might become unclearable skill trees get skils class right bat stamina based instead cooldown based except ultimate cant combo skill rotations like alpha shrine transportation thankfully great change discover shrines place activate teleport time without cost making travelling back forth lot easier quicker randomly generated worls create seed share friends different biomes still thing probably reason made play game much real difference change regions mostly visual changes scenerymost changes make feel like youre playing completely different game alpha followed wollay post history knows promised seems like played breath wild something decided nowhere change core mechanics game entirely literally nobody ever wanted asked thatthis game longer action rpg exploration adventure exploration game rpg elements thereim saying game bad different even though promised different product bad simply doesnt work exploration game punishes exploring far supposed sacrifice heavy grinding rpg freedom exploration became much grindier ever depend gear enemies drop means still need kill mobs low chance getting gear supposed endless adventure pretty much experience entire power cycle inside region always start weak beat weak enemies must escape strong ones eventually become strong steamroll every single enemy region except couple mobs power level get region become weak resetting cycle instead continuing itand make matters even worse lot bugs map generation quests sometime dont work necessary key items spawn region wollay literally disappeared social media refuses listen public updated game since release till date review dont think hell ever make changes completely silent absentwe promised lot things cut instead got mostly functional game shallow dont think need keep playing clearing first region regions pretty much thing big adventure illusion supposed swallow happy withi hope developer someday listens something highly doubt ever happen pray modders leats fiddle around give us supposed get sadly another cashgrab game better spending bucks something creator actually cares plays game seems like game gutted pretty decent alpha wait purchase better game still requires work love sucks previous alpha version better hard six years developed thing takes patience bu still fun keeps original feel game also great fun multiplayer game maker good job balancing difficulty playability would maybe made items permanent complete reset every continent maybe armour least takes time get used fun takes time warm newer progression system start questing receiving great gear blast playing difficult game sadly group friends worth took years finish ruining game old alpha amazing though lacking content gave pretty early wandering around minutes trying find mobs elites nothing dying less enjoyable wollay thought recommend even trying game unless got free options available took time still enjoyable gameif youve waiting eagerly might disappointed werent expecting anything particular pleasedmuch love wollay waaaaas nice game great game even better belive change region lock would make players actually happy game enjoyable keep great work wollay fun hours theres point finish one zone zones big enough begin features seem zonesi dont understand series poor choices development fun still fun ride beaver battle fun begining realised region locks fun play years ago cant believe waited years recieved bad game people like running around achieving anything like feel progression something im getting dont know game going updated certaintly hope anywho probably going back way thus far highly dissapointing dont feel like anything done really since last updated felt like game sincerely hope changes loved game back could play reason turned game sick talk across map get avoiding enemies firstly attack die second attack litterary dont gain anything better sure theres content mechanics arent meits like mentioned really fun realized already played entire game couple hours one reasons got excited really fun first place idea would keep giving new quests like saving guy monsters different unique quests repeating one also thought would level get new abilities something cool playing entire game basically got level realized get levels every time play entire game expected way unique mobs expected unique towns perhaps even cities stuff explore basically ideas made game exciting loved excitementbut yeah understand thats seemingly impossible goal two people achieve thats right path though concept game really got surprisingly excited worth wasnt worth wait went cool leveling exploring rpg alpha item based rpg without levels generic explorer without nothing world first review sadly also negative onethe current game fun people expecting alpha version promisedthe gear based progression bad rng still major factor finding equipment actually progress unlike alpha longer level overcome minor issues like finding better weapon whileregion locked gear whoever thought good idea current form never tested gameplay loopyou lose progress made start maybe piece carry lucky enough thrown back grinding hellthe game barebones best removed many fun features alpha promisedteased pasti advice people buy game several iterations core gameplay loop happened youre buying beta best term fun give hours fun replaying game hours mediocre fun isnt worth wont run cannot play gameupdate windows asus rog motherboard needed look task manager halt nahimics audio programs running actually worked first time able play cube world game gorgeous really love visual style havent minutes game really appreciate polish ill write later okthe alpha way fun currently equipment system kinda strange cant take upgraded stuff new zones zones equipment specific stupid point free roam progress reset every square area enteralso skill system gorecommend reluctant disappointing lot bit different old version lack skill tree exp dislike feels like different game new one feels like test patience although dont mind kind feels like alienating enjoy interacting npcs new objects aim give game really nice exploration feel like game dont use wiki work really get experience understand mean combat feels pretty evolved enjoy like still feel might satisfaction finding stuff leveling beautiful game feeling adventure definetly present cute game personally liked alpha better fond memories saw announced excited impulsively bought copy wife got could immediately tell something sadly felt like exciting adventure grindy job game doesnt sense achievement wife couldnt stand barely hours gave sad see appreciate effort though back day really sad hear devs rough time developing game trying enjoy lives gaming industry really ruthless decent game region lock isnt bad wish could keep key items going another region yet contrast alpha adds gameplay loop going new region weak nothing conquer individual section land region start get gear thatll help fight regions wish didnt pick every key item every region also tutorial sort guide start could help players dont stop playing getting every mob isnt chicken fun cute game thats fun play friends gets bit repetetive continued updates see issues game get fixed fun game high points alpha enjoy like new features version fun game hope add leveling system kill things get xp take away things fun game needs deeper rpg elements fun game need little patience start ive much fun completing first zone learned acquire gear slowly work way quests found breeze sure im illusion beta hey like going development kinda like new progression system liked gearing much cant wait zone twoi alpha backer like many kind give years back im pleased cube world isnt dead back track looking forward new things future fun game good game play friends fun game bugs simple well made game cant wait till wolfarm updates im happy got moved steam finally got give something amazing times ive game know game isnt complete yet im willing wait years next year know lot controversy game doesnt change fact fun game fun game issues currently waiting update may never come fun game lacks appeal alpha version though addition npcs quests players wanted enough make many simplified mechanics introduced cube world current version seems confused supposed mechanics discourage exploration beyond given area world may nearly infinite without real way develop character doubt players would continue playing clearing starting area fun little game play lot open world adventure games like final fantasy xi xiv skyrim fallout series actually cute little game takes mb storage world huge explore one thing doesnt level ups like final fantasy games mentioned depends weapons armors give boostfun little game really like itjust test played gt gb ran smooth issues played gtx gb card parts map stutters fps even getting game takes forever god damn shame im willing change mind wollay fix gamethere glaring issuesremoved exp skill treesregion one tied one see old system new zones harder effect new one next zone youre weakest enemies stronger new system makes hard earned gear becomes useless new zone shattering feeling progressionin old system paths grow stronger leveling eq new system instead exp grinding youre grinding mobs hope would drop better eq ocean zone alpha remember filled fishesmobs one empty clearing ocean zone saw single fish shark funnily enough wasnt even water walking rather crawling beach also clearing ocean zone better pray find boat asap travel vast blue void sometimes cant even see islands horizon render distance minimap would questioning anything ahead youre slowly swimming hope find boatinstead exp relics amazing amazingly terrible mean boosting speed combat like gliding riding etc travel faster youre lucky find traveling items zone might spend hours current game second enter next zone relic perks useless since access traveling items find new zone dont forget gear useless well oh stocked crafting materials could afford crafting amazing gear tough luck cuz blueprints also region locked suddenly clue use materials youve using last zoneold version game could progress new zone youd get beat hard barely could face tough enemies previous zone version youve cleared zone youve seen least game youre lucky next zone could say youve beat game nothing new waiting next zonethis video sum terrible changes made alphahttpsyoutube like current game clearly either never played alpha long enough forgot good alpha cant wait either dev update fixadd old good stuff modders step good game needs updates could example sky whistle spirit bell treasure spirit lute disapears boat climbing spikes hang glider reins dont good game needs changes region locking core items like boats gliders ext idc region locking armor powered good armor whole entire game future changes want game combat abilities classes new artifacts influence combat overall good game price changes stop weeping alpha cucks good game good friends funny geim good game wasnt meant accept creator likely going change anything fun good sound track wasnt promised definitely wasnt alpha people looking harshly think good game good game let tell everyone playing expected laid alpha however alpha subject change wasnt entirely convinced changes first either fact even posted places much hated buddy got play awhile figured main thing need explore take advantage fact items town shops rotate every day midnight talk every npc say dumb shit rest give quest locations build slowly required gear start trying complete quests gear score youre water biome start hopping large islands map boat almost always somewhere thats easy find mostly land biome recommend trying find riding reins save lot time scroll map look around structures trouble finding things star middle mouse button mapfinally dont think changing regions started fun focused region eventually get region gear sometimes shop even sells white rarity region gear stick inventory later change regionsoverall good game major changes hope review help guys fun game dont forget still working reason took long two people developing game doubt make living good game dont like need start every new point great casual game exploration dungeon crawling thanks wollay great game compared old version new version lot things new monsters new plots new objects heroic abilities rich npc dialogues diverse terrain pets grow strength heroes also see things havent done well disappearance seabed organisms topography marine ecology treasures normally acquired terrain terrain gaps terrain drops lead special doors unable stop players nice game ive waited much game niche game think lot negative reviews unwarranted enjoying game past hours released recommend playing friends see could bit dulli dont get hate towards progression think promising past hours liked progressioni hope wollay keep working game like pretty good game leave starting region progress caries pet rare weapons extend surrounding regions isnt really point fighting anymore dropped leveling system skill tree besides however game enjoyable id recommend buying game sale pretty good game game isnt everyone enjoy like tried something new mainly referring gear region lock system quite different alpha version enjoy challenge new area start useless gear seem tedious times nice feature playing friends matter long friends played play even level think good improvements would small permanent stat boosts combat skills instead travel skills seem pretty pointless longer varied reins item region locked ride pets anywhere walking slow world basically infiniteif positive content changes continued get added think ill start enjoy even real shame couldve masterpiece good enjoy voxel art running around quests exploring colorful world dont get game really fun enjoyable game wollay really improved game something proud however might everyones taste progression system completely different alpha rpgs game still improved many ways high hopes really fun game first fifteen hours gets kind repetitive play friends still fun youre playing alone dont expect get lot different gameplay really fun game quite learning curve sometimes feels like start bit still really neat concept shame game got bombarded negative reviews trolls seems thing common nowadays sadthe current game focuses exploration make feel like rediscovering world time tought solo game really enjoyable fun friends great exploration experience shame really loved alpha version game could get websidei got right dev went silent thought working bigger update kept waitingi waited waited little found seemingly disappeard internetso many promises heldmany features implementedmany problems gameplay resetting everything entering different areaits shame happened game developer went silent releasing thisdont get try get alpha much fun good game honestly shouldnt taken levels talent trees levels brought accomplishment feeling game year wait still well built game still needing polish lot stuff game overall would recommend game want challenging fun coop rpg game interesting unique game even alpha better fun fun realize developer manipulative liar baits community years rewards love loyalty whatever bullsht game fun bit especially youre friends refuse recommend game developer treats community like imagine ordering hamburger fries end receiving singular fry postit sticking says hamorger wouldnt surprised woolay dev pretends depressed second time poor launch game steam come back us years later new update adds helicopters wonder reviews like happens alright alpha better terms combat version better terms bug fixes adventure game explore places rinse repeat much depth anymore gear mostly region locked get gear degrades adjacent zones still better starting scratchits worth got hours kill friends enjoyable game old one lot fun basically alpha cube world guess scraped made thats potential good game doesnt mutch content old alpha world looks better years since ive played game alpha phase cannot remember spent much time playing thisstill fun play group friends bit mindless time consumingmore come many years making patience paid cube world proven unique adventure game game vast stunning adventure honestly cant recommend enough im really glad made friend joining polished overall better hoped forone important note die lot especially first lose nothing die time lose sort punishment big beautiful cumbersometheres interesting game cant get way ui could compelling leveling destroys progress regions monsters wildly outside power levelyet world beautiful inviting desire see needs updates certainly alpha ive played region ive spawned far really damn hard enjoying dont think negative feedback really necessarygood points lore cool new terrain generation think addictive fun combat generally fun quest lines nice music animations pretty cool new attacks petting animals fast travel alpha desperate need neater inventory cool new creatures much fun dungeons many good concepts game playbad points quite slow difficult first lack exp system removal old toolbarmoveset characters region lock gear somewhat repetitive quest system old controls felt natural thats preference removal certain old features exp systemskill tree need unlock respawn shrines using go far distance without finding shrine killed something powerful quickly end back started havent unlocked shrineover enjoying playing game really dont think hate necessary id recommend game new player trying wouldnt recommend avid fan alpha definitely good game fair price expect get game alpha different opinion worse hope content future thats hope thing want say enjoy playing game strengths weaknesses different years ago love game many quests items gather friends make great lot people problem items reseting go new biome fun experience collecting new items opinion like change give game different alpha something everyone empty people claim alpha empty nothing game something behind every corner dont skilltree would nice get sense progression artifacts gear gear even op one area start new one still gear im excited future updates still enjoy game much years ago different alpha better alpha nahstill good game yes different alpha vast amount core loop changed dramatically longer level forever progress game akin looping legend zelda zone new world worth requiring pretty much start unless grinded enough get hands legendary gear even usable zones next one got meaning need start thing personally ive got gripes loops moment namely fact leveling pretty pointless get artifact increases misc skill like swimming ridding ive yet seen one anything combat based sure thing relying gear makes dungeons feel pointless boat extremely early zone want slight decrease stamina usage swimming dont get wrong enjoy game good play long new content features dont fit well personally emptyi spent first minutes trying figure check quests see way check youve spoken npc times afterwardsthe next minutes spent holding w reached gnome wasnt even trouble traderthen found hang glider mountain neat jumped started gliding minute fell sky death glider disappeared amazing designive known cube world since around store originally went expected years game would different id seen nope pretty much lose progress lotthis game nowhere near worth towards spend money actual game even better alpha must buy finally seriously enjoyed game would recommend othersthe features quite fun examples glider petsthere one feature dislike region exclusive stuff due fact dont keep itemsbut hey maybe thats fun addictive visual style cute looks awesome fun play offline like train flight fun pretty fun miss lot alpha fun friends dont attempt play game fun kind hate sound design lags bit proton linux worth sure fun lack real progression means game gets stale hours hours enjoyment looking recommend fun likehalf hour hour gets boring pretty quickly hadnt played boyfriend im sure would gotten boring even sooner graphics look pretty cute relaxing play thats game doesnt offer really much gigantic map cant really anything personally love exploring justdidnt motivation game everything theres really anything explore imo idkid love diversity game make something huge world spawn id love explore worth right fun least fun quite gets super repetitive completing regions quests quests recycled different zones hardly diversity theres real progression thing work towards gaining levels give menial stats lamp radius riding speed sailing speed etc shame tbh fun first regions fun big fan new leveling system fun get bitthe start game take little need time get first pieces equipment get rolling becomes fun explore world fight mobs especially together friends really nicenow game may perfect way much room improvement im already enjoying state cube world feel fairly certain changes future lot good game fun understand play things workthe biggest problem nothing explained need go though forums order understand things working certain way straightforward one would assume games author biggest sin hes made quite serious changes without justifying also explaining fun youre geared play game fun run like schmo green blue enemies enter new land gear suddenly doesnt work feet east fun play friends hours cleared chunks already bored cant even imagine playing fun friends imo fun still fun dont go expecting major updates game creator went silent launch fun starting new sections probably seems super tedious best way think fun getting explore new place bottom really fun fun think kid game continue entertained adventure long time older audiences starting scratch every zone starts drag time think game lot potential glorious alpha days youre older gamer expect get couple days still recommend getting game ive definitely put moneys worth honestly enjoyed time far funny game went years developer wollay disappearing teasing things disappearing without actually releasing updates hes showing fast forward game releases everyone excited play new content none updates teased game content original game removed point somehow less content originaloh wait isnt funny big messto put things short game longer form xp levelling skill tree learned new abilities also gone along abilities theres barely reason anything anymore top game split biomes cross new biome gear previous biome dissapears theres levels youre basically starting lost progresswollay probably gone like past years dont buy unless comes back actually fixes issues good different alpha missing things developers seem best man team mean week beta week fixed lot bugs short time span compared mostit seems changed directions mid production whether good bad opinion based personally think nice constant need get new gear new regions alpha possible get point one shot everything rewarding get though becomes easy unenjoyable though thats say could better way approach always im saying see attempt made keep feel growing constant wed prefer including mestill though content updates come bettering qol hopefullyim good reviews hope point acrosstldr game good trying dobut want specifically anticipatingstill good though hope content pushed better good gamei enjoyed itbut theres almost year nowno updatei cant take anymore got charming art combat pretty decent figure buttons attack game isnt engaging clear first zone figuring clear first zone chore game communicates nothing better ways waste cubeworld got lag issues running proton linux laptop fairly playablea great game great take dungeon delving rpg games great see game pop lot good updates changes game since first appearance must say quite admire work wollay done working game seem lot complaints gear useful region obtained first complained indeed annoying lose progress upon changing zones found way kept things fresh get strong gear start destroying everything actually bad player retention way games avoid losing players way making stronger stronger enemies gear keep player grinding become stronger old cube world used went starting zone enemies would become stronger problem limit game infinite zones neigh impossible keep scaling strength enemies gear every zone instead effect achieved lowering gears level changing zone feel kinda bad stuff taken away return world feels rewarding find special items often constantly getting better gear favorite part feature friends play time without needing worry level whatever simply drop move fresh zone current complaints game pets aside used mount find riding gear pointless hope system get revamped future weapon augmenting via adding voxels really cool pretty pointless reason push strength weapons higher obtained maybe occasional yellow tier boss crafting seldom used id bother happen get access purple yellow tier item means use item nearby zones crafts also really expensive dont plan oftenthats think time guess mention written day released publicly played early access bunch steam hard nice colorful smooth gameplay bit empty happy see back alive long hard give game thumbs downhowever besides horrible horrible lack communication devs supporting win pretty big points game still supported updated people bought game years ago got steam keys game fun play even bit hard get lacking real aim stillon personal sidenote combat lot fun older version though impressive game better full release horrible game used quite enjoyable first came version nothing cube world know love extremely unbalanced exp system completely removed absolutely progression anything enjoyable game want play game thats like old cube world dont expect anything like game would recommend garbage anyone real kinda bad right hopefully wollay improve timethis review wip literally exact thing years ago except favorite features removed released steam hoped get lot new skills items biomes enemies bosses years afterall instead released exact thing less content adding single new enemy would improved game instead took step backwards lost hope game many years ago got back found releasing steam week however seeing weve gotten im left even less hope meh honest nice play game didnt changed lot beginnings journeyi definitely recommend playing bad premise alpha interested almost decade ago didnt age well still feels like early access title back region locked gear system one strangest things ive ever seen think understand practise leads gameplay experience almost feels like punishing exploring otherwise interesting world rpg farm good item became useless another zone finished game great bad either biggest issue game current progression system sucksyou check video review explain bit ultimately recommend enjoy game game gets old progress gets reset go new biome including gear key items travel items exception relics artifacts entire goal game grind relic items relics always hidden inside star dungeon forcing grind gear max get item thatll give swim speedeven manage get enough relics mount speed cant use mount new biome find item map said biome makes entire process relic farming pretty pointlessi would recommend game play biomes done except price bit high considering average playtime probably around hours first biome solo less youre friends released really glitchier back alpha times couldnt even play teammate removes fun game worth money expected necessarily wanted cube worlds progression fun little thing play alone watching youtube another screen blast play online friends progression actually works fairly well game region locked gear major gripe modding community picks steam definitely worth price developmental end point teased like grinding sense progression worth playing even get free worth time whatsoever theres progression system anymore alas nothing keep going forward leveling gone basically getting best gear one region moving another region find stuff previous uselessmind developer accomplished years okay modded game development long really expected much content difference alpha build current one areharmful seems like enemy variety fewer landscape still massive empty quests locations far apart travel portion nearly interesting enough compelling npcs say stuff shallow lore cute addition feels like real value could still call alpha version would fooled mei certainly like game still see overhauled amazing game wish modding community alive definitely dont abandon game wollay okay good hoped beta alpha better opinion would love understand leveling system yeah pretty boring combat isnt really fun buggy hell play trove lol pretty fun youre need fixes multiplayer super laggy one could fixed updatemaybe someday pretty good pretty sparse terms content fun indie game good dont necessarily agree mechanics gear leveling really weird quite diffrent alpha still like really fun play better friends grind interesting bit repetitive really great havent seen previous versions game unbiased opinion like plays good job really sad seeing bad reviews game loved even sad completely garee reviews used love playing cube world always came back feeling exploring levelling getting new better gear feeling longer something experiencing game love world looks smaller biomes better world generation questing system waaaay better thats really important game enhoyable however got eorse many important aread like exploration progression gear traits like riding pet region locked means gear becomes dogshit outside biome got cant level way strange rpg say enjoyable levelling character getting new gear levelling skills felt good play feels bad really hope wollay fix cause unlikely play current state sad couldnt get expected especially loved everything game except game still beautiful game years really like progression inside region beginning cant even kill vegetables properly hours playing slice onions like pro wash radish drain fun game cute new gear system allows much playability progress next level area little bit start playing friends makes even fun truly shame last server cube world finally shuts hope game dwindled announcement game launching steam got excited maybe game isnt dead yet maybe hope left disappointment release removed everything made alpha version fun honestly wollay wants actually give back community genuinely wanted see game well ready support needed release download alpha steam weirdly paced grindy really tried like got bored would better classes items region locked real progression system place enemies extremely harshi adored alpha made alpha great replaced andor removed fun glad able play used play many years ago available lot updates wish tutorial thought things changed past version bit different alpha traditional genre think still really solid game controls super sharp mess settings gameplay diverse class different move sets various weapons well specializations getting rid talent tree bummer like game doesnt tell play learn play messing around killing things overall wish features alpha still great game decent game fun interesting get lot however flaws pretty bad one need play game friends otherwise boring slog bore hour mark also get repetative awhile system enter new zone got start basic weapons good bad allows constant challange wont get place one shot everything get pretty fustrating spending hours zone start overall however solid game repeat need play friends trust wise feel sloggish dull fun game joke compared alpha version game developers didnt touch game released alpha wouldve better unfortunately changed lot stuff made game worse game still fun seriously downgraded shame state really hope devs bring back old version game use instead versionyou buy game youre either bored saleheres alpha review game shows specifically happened fun game fact basically start scratch every time get new area ruins game exploring getting gear feels punishes many people eloquently stated problems game could wont bother cube world isnt fun current state truly hope changes better future stands good game big fan new artifact update theres still time improvemend dislikes people around hour game good game old combat system better like ideas though tons expansion great exploration game friendsthere neat crafting draw items little blocksthis isnt type rpg grind monsters get tonnes exp level bunch junkyou level collecting artifacts make game easier play dont necessarily make strongerif played alpha probably wont like games fault great game followed since first came altho enjoyed game updates lot awesome changes cant agree worth play cant wait see wollay great game work put amazing still rly fun tons cool new things addedi think sees alot us happy new region lock system understand put alot work system us cant completely redo brand new system even old system without changing bunch work years put game ppl need support wife give time overall game great improve sure weeks go great game needs till get used learn everything feels great learn even new things abolutley awesome great game lots content definitely fixes example walk like mins go one mission p nice game u play friends u play alone kind boring lot fun gets kind repetitive fun game payed original alpha enjoyed well new changes gives game replayability player enjoys tougher games challenged alpha power trip level pass everything game wyyy easy awesome game tho would love og features removed open world game never ends gets old great soundtrack gives legend zelda vibes awesome friends becomes boring couple hours different game alpha probably classic rpg cool different alpha still enjoyable gem wont everyones cup tea thoughty wollay pixxie personally got moneys worth fun fun friends think nostalgia initial hype way back scewed view game slightly fun short time leave one region nothing cube world grinding mobs gold weapons armor make progress recommend current stagei bought back early alpha daysot dont know couldnt write prerelease review although activated steam key game available steam people ability waitvalve explain fun cool feels good get new loot long term progression plus dev wife went deleted tweets dev blog looks like packed left scammed us good enough good guess good back really good back good worth buy hard love game bought game first alpha definitely share problems back fell flat super fast dropped almost instantly beta came week ago see people angry region lock system also see whole region lock thing exists prevent instant boredom hitting endgame perhaps enemies scaled power level could good middle ground prevent boredom understand game one man project still lean towards negative side positive side game oh yeah dev also gone ghost releasing game thats pretty cool guess like going meet chick spoken long time online meeting chris hansen like playing early access different gameat least give us option play alphabeta versions first time writing review steam game actually pretty fun tho think region lock kinda dumbbasically first hours game fun u enter new region everything u worked gonei always big fan cube world cant wait future updates bcoz atm game messed good alpha still good game exactly game promised betas whats changed arguably worse aspects though lot changes postivecube world still remains fun game especially fun friends extremely easy use dropdrop multiplayer fun perfect fun time spent farlooking forward seeing future content best fun great exploration mods used cube world cool feels like game missing really hope updates ok worth wait functioning item progression doesnt really make sense traveling new lands require weapons area makes cannot bring fav weapons overall playable fun really fun even better friends really good lot replayability difficult moments though traveling take first starting new area lot fun thing could wish change would multiplayer get fixed moment nearly unplayable due extreme amounts lag ie seconds door tried open opens still good game wasnt supposed except cuz likely creator isnt going change anything fun good sound track wasnt promised definantly weasnt alpha people looking harshly think game compared something else fun buts laggy even great connection worth checking outedit nvm great gamebut everyone without leveling system get lucky find good gear get better gear handle locations help progress game works locations map moment join nothing landscape text waypoints need find achieve talking friendly adventurers walking around area also zoom map try find also something hate understandable respawn system find statues play flute activate respawn fast travell finaly artefacts wich acts level helps movement combat yeah mention gear area locked like thatif recommend game would recommend people like exploring big open world good game something missing like levling grind new spells easier like old beta still extually good game ive playing cubeworld since alphait fundamentally fun game still requires many updates new players confusing tutorial difficult monsters early one clear insight doi like wollay going direction new creative want cube world uniquer game certainly isif continues get significant updates beyond bug fixes highly recommend ive playing cube world past year finally came beta ecstatic wasnt disappointed basically game remember different form progression people used pains see people give game bad reviews clear sense progression people would probably like people complained beta seem know much games change alphas betas sooo ive playing hours must admit different alpha dont think thats bad thing recall people alpha would grind crabs level imo far less enjoyable exploring entire regions level game polished however also know games official launch think agree minecraft didnt much launch either think fun game love replayability regions makes exploration based game wollay creator intended years ago im already level prove game though barebones naked eye still plenty tons charm ive played game years waited progress years im glad game finally coming recent changes core game made indifferent new system statues fun make exploring fun saying zones items pointless makes exploring core part least enjoyable artefacts worth restarting gear items boost get taken away would fine skill tree game hoping gets added back waste without feeling like anything hope change wont recommend things change id say diffrent destroyed get good gear fun mess around get artifacts ive waited years game finally release always following wollays twitter excitement little know would remove best aspect game removing xp system skill tree adding regionlocked gear like actual f shoulda released cubeworld bring back alpha way im playing friends way fun garbage played minutes trying find kill mobs dont exactly hp im going start saying alpha player waited years im honestly really happy disappointed alpha players miss xp feature everything else leveling cube world back day huge pain ass level two took hours reach really didnt much although miss little bit like games ruined lot people also complained items getting way worse honest think encourages exploration fun game lot fun new mechanics everything incredibly fun youre looking open world rpg play players may well game would definitely recommend im going word review basic terms possibly review coming perspective someone actively participating beta period previous week release moment hours record gamecube world open world exploration voxel game wears rpg trappings around like cloak trappings fabricdeep gameplay loop involves player traveling around singular region completing quests region gearing eventually take dungeonslegendary quests obtain artifact region moving onto next region cross another region gear resets basic stats star star player must start grind motivation artifacts however reward offer secondary exploration based stats swim speed light radiusthis core gameplay loop cube world lets look pros cons gameprosgame runs well technical hiccups alllandscapesbiomes diverse nice look atthe

piece gear usually weapon cube world game trying new type progression loop sadly doesnt feel like offers much progression strength constantly reset loop replayed en masse motivation presented player collection artifacts dont effect combat centric statisticsi cant good conscience give version cube world release positive review personally game glaring balance flaws im type player enjoys negative reinforcement loop done future game updated issues addressed change review time however currently would give game recommendation buy unless player issue cons stated sounds like type game would enjoy enjoy psa warning shouldnt say please also aware looking game communicative developer cube world game developer regularly speak players host amas etc choice right course however outlook consequences people looking clear roadmap game going evolve critiques game posted many players beta period week prior release words exchanged dev community im honestly incredibly disappointed game turned years get developer gone though mental health issues mean game cant criticized person bought alpha im happy fact design choices made seems attempt cover fact content game super barebones enemies borderline require lure npc groups travelling map killed due fact weapons armour start arent strong enough take weakest enemies without killed hits yes game gear based progression gear drops enemies gear worth gathering gear bought villages still good enough ensure survivalthe major complaint youll hear game fact complete zone cant use items found includes glider find climbing gear every item get via quest get next zone design choice logically makes zero sense unless mask lack content game game solid direction alpha years ago combat worse evasive moves alpha gone skill tree dying sends nearest shrine much walking send minutes away objective youre going top people bought alpha gotten stem key promised ignored devs like years ago issues arosedo buy game unless significant changes made doubt happen person teamvery dissatisfied im recommending game please hear played back aloha years ago incredible current release bit different doesnt mean bad would nice skill tree think developers deliberately didnt include thats fine enjoy game great fun ill continue play negative reviews come people didnt want game change alpha ive waiting game years amazing suggest everyone buy ive waiting game like years honestly wasnt worth every time enter region essentially restart first start game youre extremely levelled resort cheesing ai consistently kill revert alpha please dear god game buggy bad amazing original years ago spend lot time game finding gear getting artifacts downside gear region locked get used find lot better gear level locked makes feel like progressing lot wouldve alpha version set skills already depending class pick changing guild guy also better leveling levels unlock like alpha people rate game bad enjoyed spending hours life collecting good gear one shot every mob game find region locking enjoyable implement keeps game fresh challenge explore world tell think game comments fun played alpha still bugs still fun none less system different one people want doesnt mean badregion locking rather popular complain abouthowever people arent saying creative quite perfectly implemented im hoping minor improvements several rpgs fallen prey solves problem endgame always content challenging content one age old issues rpg fight hardest bosses content get best gear best gear actually youre already done game isnt case cubeworld next region new challenge number creep rpgs huge number scaling problems health damage values start small game scales get ridiculous stop fun see seven digit numbers place youre actually hitting harder mobs scale matter much bigger number cubeworld numbers stay small bosses five digit health thats dont keep getting bigger bigger forever reset back managable next always join friend thats right trouble dealing leveled leveled friend go new region like new game challenge youa lot people acting like region locking absurd basic idea progress resetting like similar prestiging video games get top unlock everything voluntarily go back start maybe minor permanent upgrades design game look region separate new adventure start small fry build way eventually conquer dungeons get best loot well artifacts think idea works wonderfully well time biggest issue artifacts pretty uninspiring slight mobility upgrades advice would make every artifact much bigger effect several dozen combat non combat effect feel also make stack enough likely see new one long timeanyway thats two cents bad whining would lend believe need understand isnt traditional rpg dont think thats bad thing dont need xp bar filling good timethanks reading came back moneyi trusted wollay followed game years never lost hope even recommended game launch encourage fed upno communication september clearly stagged disappointing final game manages less content alpha build years ago reworked worse theres really fun complete region let us use items regions use complete regionit make game even fun doesnt huge amount replayability moment hopefully sort proper progression come game point artifacts download cracked version alpha much greater time find someone share nonsteam alpha play game better part like everyone else waited supported game years happy outcome game lot potential could huge success game hollow repetitive boring idea dev guess neither anyone else lmao like many alpha buyers barely recognized game changed much however looked past saw game started lot fun way progression system built never hit point stagnation plagues many rpgs game always remains challenging allowing infinitely progress explore managed ingame settings already fell love game noits good yet unfinished makes soooo bad gets updated next years yes nonot worth years waited worth price tag worth anyones timea huge waste time money fun potential fun needed changes made whole preogression system needs reworked used hope gets better play alpha forget update came try imagine better future read reviews gaem good clear bad reviews game harsh still great game still one fav games people cant see put expectations high theyve clearly forgot one person working makes sad know people cant open goddamn eyes one second learn game understand wollay human know still beta ive played alpha know may feel fleshed know perfect game know exactly wanted right happy things still change things would like change like artifacts really underbuffed maybe make gear slightly less rare understandable lets ride together fun anythings want changed remember still betahave fun everyone keep going wollay game great youre great job kept playing looking something like really wanting enjoy end extremely repetitious game never actually progress character meaningful way first hour youll throughout entire game still lot potential game ever developed sadly im doubtful killing monsters exploring fun anymore since alpha oh well missing much since forgot game back bought kind feels like developer didnt really know handle weight internet shoulders game exploded first released high praise lots anticipation come fast forward half decade actually maybe decade boom heres sloppy butchered build game plays fundamentally different original stripped whatever made original fun whatever goes bucksdont buy game kind difficult get started addicting better skill skill cap high loot puts roller coaster emotions beta release made polarizing game still worth time thoroughly enjoyed far hours play time kinda bummed payed play hours thought years hype game would better pirated copy didnt pay welp thats way goes please make game open source sure community could actually make really fun unlike current state kinda hurts give negativ reviewthe alpha version way better much fun playing early days kudos developer updating game putting steamthe current version however needs work either revert back old progression system give better reason want first region lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo thanks loved game alpha boy creat better game years lack true progression lackluster content even compared alpha highly recommend picking game various issues progression dealt lacks storyline clear objectives weird mechanics terms progression gameits still good surely better friends time lame progressionno progression system ruined compared alpha good game anymore last tweet september blog deletedwollays reputation yeetedits like decided take page mans sky worse least nms devs kept working game seems like wollays interested taking money running let preface stating rarely feel compelled write negative review game time ive done review mans sky release feel like says lot state game currently bto anyone thinking buying game anywhere near date review would highly recommend save money come back later whenif glaring issues fixed bi bought cube world years years ago proposed features possibilities gave hope game could blossom something really enjoyable purchasing booted alpha make sure worked computer never touched unfortunately seems terrible idea considering game im playing disrespects time game ive played alpha version apparently going much fun direction pains say theres really good skeleton could built something awesome wasnt plagued torturous game design choices bthe goodblist world characters enjoyable look aesthetic light fun variety races choose character good models cute tame pets mounts variety also good theyre adorable little random bits lore get plaques dialogue nice touch game doesnt really require like lot also lot dialogue npcs encounter friendly cute even limited combat youre balanced slightly outofyourleague encounter quite fun engaging played mage weapon functions abilities cool fun exploration initially engaging draws quite well different items improve mobility like boats hang gliders climbing boots etc make traversal fun mage also ability levitate teleport fun use abuse well listbthe badbbeverything related progressing character feels horrible far way glaring problem gameplay tainted poorly handled bthe meaningful way ive seen make character stronger find gear better stats however almost loot find limited zone find means time spent gearing character tackle quests one zone immediately useless step zones borders next includes things like boats hang gliders climbing boots make traversing world faster fun youve finally got boat want go explore neighboring ocean biome claim seas offer well good luck sail border boat disappears youre left either sail way back land swim find boat biome could complete side finally tamed pet want mount found reins well leave biome good luck finding reins pet cant used mount gain levels game way find artifacts hidden around different biomes could interesting things run around discover boons artifacts give things like able hold breath underwater longer bit stamina use gliding hang glider compelling rewarding find bthere sense balanced progression comes enemies within zone either bfrom tell enemies spawned randomly list applicable enemies biome npc given rarityrank come form numbers stars attached name color similar rarity systems games cool idea implementation alongside random enemy spawns found often instantly killed randomly spawned godtier mage archer possessed somethingorother hiding behind tree random smattering extremely powerful enemies walking alongside level goons made almost completely abandon fighting enemies werent tied directly quests addition even choose engage overworld enemies usually drop couple gold coins pet snack lack enemy balance also bleeds dungeons youll sometimes find initial rooms hallways filled easily defeatable creatures smacked face boss kill one hits way health deal damage unless youre able kite around minutes without getting hit getting bugged cheesing fight take long fighting something die run back everything previously killed dungeon respawns gates blocking progress locked right back ties back character progression gear find dungeon useful biome hell would spend bunch time slogging fights get item useless cross line map get artifact thatll give slight buff useless stat bonce complete one biome feel like want move next youre basically starting game everything meaningful youve earned point nullified case would want continue playing first one bwithout doubt game still lot potential big part really hopeful one day come back itll better state however completely dependent entirety character progression lack completely revamped enemies encounters rebalanced work handinhand progression absurd biome limitations removed let say outright dont go game alpha player mindset step back weeks clear mind take whirl youll realize game still quite whirl play around art style cutelycubic combat simplistic fun world feels much alive compared alpha game regionlock big deal ive gotten let start stating like game played alphacube world game nice graphics amazing idea great potential currently final state contains minor bugs enough spend decent amount time hrs might get repetitive region lock whenever go new region lose stuff start solution one might consider downloading mods fix one might able find sites like nexusmods mods think gameplay cubeworld pretty fun especially friends able get hours gamei currently spend hours game know friend even surpassed hoursif want gameplay information cube world suggest watch videos youtube let start saying ive never played alpha game friend got game week launch watched play thought looked pretty fun far great time im saying game perfect handful bugs ive come across dont fully agree core game functions bugs think top head would duplicate pets inventory thought maybe tamed two animal nope named one pulled pet default animal name serious problem one mobs game cant think name look like onionlings hat made blades spin attack youve seen things know im going boss spinning aoe attack reach miles makes impossible get close deal damage youre playing mage youll problem us melee people got chance fucker kills us hits cannot complete quest shit first problem ive got core functions game able use boat spirit bell ect zones go find thing every time cross line new zone second thing artifacts work think good idea poorly executed nobody cares fast boat goes thing speed boat maybe instead climbing speed riding speed max health max mp like said artifacts cool idea lot fun collect wish boosted useful stats thats last thing would change would region locking instead items go gold white go region go gold purple go another region go purple blue game really fun lot enjoyable friends lag problems playing friends youll rubber band seconds everything thats happened around time play speed bad times keeps happening kind annoying worth meh thats honestly worth sale uh yeah let failure arpg fun game general stand testament happens developing alone years without accepting kind feedback betatesting week without accepting kind feedback lets real really good first couple hours later get really pointless tbf worth money long spend game also need respond dev lets forget look game subpar combat seems fun first gets really repetitive limited number skills nothing unlock regard would ok meaty good base combat doesnt explorations well procedural generated youve seen one youve seen fair large enough variety encounter types last biomes thats plus game looks fine sometimes offer really beautiful scenery however game world part feels empty quest system barely existent spam talk everyone see point place marks map lore superficial unengaging crafting system basic seems mostly irrelevant even due region locking equiptment recipes decent fun hours gets repetitive fast shallowness pretty much every system game starts show recommend regional equivalent ever sale might worth grabbing short mindless fun especially plan playing group mods address larger might say mindblowingly questionable design choices issues game however end end highlighting emptyness shallowness game also worth noting developer silent pretty much since release history vanishing anybody even looks slightly unhappy product wouldnt expect ever updated lets progression system rewarding fun hours end remove entirely walk border everything weapons armor boat glider disappears get new boat glider every single zone awful system awful game dont bother level progression getting artifacts regions every time collect one get little bit faster literallythe gear get region gets nullified another unless wear gear case wear adjacent regions got itmissions dont vary much close nothing regionscontent seems lacking hours ive played ive seen see got boredthis game like really love exploration leveling confusing gearloot hard understand direction motive rpg clear good path keeping player interested playing game great would perfect new system really hard get good grip direction finding mobs get loot counter productive loot barely drops mobs harder grind practically damage play realize extremely long grinding game put almost hours even get starting set gear loot drop rate easier might bad leveling system got weird imo love like lot people already written game lot hype big expectations sadly big changes made game ruined fun existed first hours amazing lots fun youre done zone realize hours youve spent basically useless gets kinda dull depressing gameplay throughout youre hoping find gear works zones means u constantly farm like anything game make better worse played game back alpha certainly changed still enjoyable everi absolutely recommend reading guide begin getting hang controls ui tricky firstit seems unlikely devs return game however considering game created twoperson team stands impressive feat unique style playwhile game lack polish direction game worth best played friends like many people bought game back alpha absolute blast play friends got many hours fastforward steam release everything changes many people seem seen bad thing honestly enjoy incentive actually fully explore new region scaled pretty large truly think lot replayability new system excited put hours like many others got alpha game many years ago think version may better although irrelevant game back slightly different game game unfinished uninspired piece garbage idea developer thought would good idea release game state anything rereleased new alpha started cant help feel like took money ran years ago threw piece garbage together released bleed turnip little money unfortunate potential ok rant time actually reviewas game biggest flaw version game giant world many biomescountries explore absolutely reason leave one area due extremely strange design choice armorweaponsitems carry countries im guessing hours worth gameplay item scaling pretty much maxed character doesnt really level experience system items thing cause character improve way inclined go countries pretty much replaying crappy game finished enjoy rpg rougelikes run hour boring unbalanced piece sht guess game might say rougelike closest genre use describe game ruining mechanic replaying experience anyways ive rambled enough typically dont like super negative games game earned kinda wish never officially released could still joke friends checking updates like many waiting hoping game release chance play without torrenting already voiced many others game remember much preferred xp based progression replaced gear effectively resets realm constants relics collect seem provide small boosts things like climbing speed lantern radius theres sense progression outside realm get tired given realm opt find new adventure another forced start scratch effectively negates interest adventuring even collecting materials improve gear let alone crafting feel like theres time fix game issues even ive neglected mention ultimately game feels like nonbo premise advertises loved game first debuted years ago admittedly fun playing first purchased however cannot stress repetitive game feels quickly interest continuing dies sincerely wish wollay picroma best luck game hope realize gear based progression isnt way go almost wish could go back play original version ill stay hopeful wollay realizes far hes strayed original basis game built like others wanted like game really someone would check twice month past years kind news alpha fun wasnt enough content make play long however would absolutely say alpha better full release like many others cant stand region lock lack feeling like made progress hours play time also wasnt expecting massive update alpha full release expecting got wollay spend last years working game chance hell honestly would surprised worked month accumulated time game past years another sad note seems wollay gone one knows ever add anything game thankfully fans passionate game modders saviors game give us asking want game good like liked alpha beta get boring whilebut someone made mod made game much enjoyablebut game worth wouldnt get hopes cube world liked didnt like addicted yeet liked alpha versio game since game changed alot never grew like release versio maybe grew pun intented listen game used better alpha fact new zone go makes cant use current stuff needs removed would really love play game new content still game system zone go farther first zone gets harder like alpha listen get game reinvented multiple times years dont understand version decided call good enough sure added nice quality life things npc interactions fast travel got rid everything made cube world game jumping friends chaining dungeons get elemental pieces could augment weapons leveling meaningful ways lots templescavesdungeons take real sense progression reason reviews low reason people complaining honestly would ended better took money run dig hole track record take another years tried get version really gives incentive play isnt fun want succeed really going long way go interested playing find version alpha play instead save bucks reinvents state better consider buying literally meaningful progression thanks region lock little new content years almost everything scrapped sidegrades downgrades various unanimously loved aspects game infinite randomly generated maps crafting experience levels gear doesnt become useless leave tiny bit land looted etceven feel like saying bad cant say better complete game way feel like theres much less still potentially fun itll likely never history changing game could beeneven starbound mans sky likes better lauch dev still refuses communicate fanbase dishonest salvageable probably dev swallows pride overcomes fears stops going hiding doesnt try run away launch profits takes matters hands listens feedback tries make compromises updates game content improvements community much happier perhaps even willing continue supporting game even reverted alpha version continued slowly update finish game people would probably much happier chances happening close null im sure jaded fans ready forgive anytime soon eithersad see much wasted potential steep price become lmao ddos gave man depression reading reviews gonna send straight shadow realm lmao imagine woollay actually caring feedback dumpster fireone hasnt posted twitter since september happened release game updates enjoy game trash statecheers cubeworld lol much better long story short played alpha liked itplayed beta still really like long time alpha player games combat mechanics remain smooth fastpaced addition new abilities release new quest system breath fresh air wellbuttheprogressionits completely fuckedinstead leveling via xp unlocking better equipment higher stats skill points spend progress tied area playing old friend able clear biome hours acquiring top notch gear finally took dungeon found artifact gave less stamina drain diving oh got level cool nothing since xp skill trees removedventured another area lost gear bonuses vehicles arealocked needed gather another set gear boat glider etc unbound items rare shit usually low tierinstead progressing upwards endlessly regularly thrown back little bonusill get back game soon progress made sensible preferably skill trees vehicles become independent artifacts giving actual bonuses instead lantern range diving drop chances lowered hightier items decked characters hoursoh stuff promised guess ill make got long time fan alpha cannot good faith recommend game anyone far many poor design choices clear downgrade alpha version reviews listed poor design choices thus core game far frustrating fun id suggest staying clear game look like game ive read beta game comments cant understand developer removed xp region locked weaponson top hard find fire wood ectand tthe fact lvl wepons defeatig bosses almost impossible defeat basic weaposn start make difficultperhaps rebalance retrurn xp skill trees move new biodome love value buy ie stage weapons look reviews want see core issues game want point personal major negativethe combat progression sucks playing alpha felt rewarded unlocking new skills via level system beta however character starts every combat ability theyll ever causing game grow stale combat wise incredibly quickly look enjoy cube world game still fantastic mods like alphahopefully wollay takes mod feedback people consideration next updatei really want best game set mods get people back look really love cube world love effort put feels like change gameplay much progression feels lost going different realm wouldnt bad could bring glider pet riding skill make enjoyable feel like halt exploring keep finding stuff zone overif resources could spotted outline idly way collect make upgrade easier zones thatd bit better cant enjoy playing look people mad years game changed gameplay wise think get years take time find everything zone find itemsspecial items game fun highly recommend itit would much better gear scaled difficulty traveled special items transferred still beta always get better look isnt alot like alpha anymore still great game alot people write bad reviews expected totally still download like rpg games looking game spend time exploring interesting world cool events game youi highly recommend game avoid toxic community looks good great game ganked roaming mobs night tutorials anything obvious region locked geardont get worth price tag youd better playing trove looks like wollay released alpha version game got dark also known funckstille whats wollay still lots bugs issues game needs fixed see updates looks pretty neat really despise new progression system lost charm everything made exciting beta removed replaced mechanic doesnt give sense progression well contradicting core gameplay ideas game lots features cut without explanation regionslocking items makes region feel like restart almost longer term progression give game meaning exploration important extremely week regions havent invested much time cant really recommend game current state lets hope developer doesnt hide another years lots fun playing game brother talked enough npcs decent map area lots fun group adventurous players start recommending friends region block items useless leave area gets removed fixed lots fun plenty adventuring even better friends best people enjoy exploring cute little game lots potential lots new changes equipment unique regions stats reduced swap areas however get item keep stats regionsi like new game different allows explore whim lots people played alpha mad game changed development theyre mad character doesnt gain experience killing things earning talent points talent tree theyre upset gear earned one region doesnt work another like used toothats fine opinions like ahles everyone one stink game brigaded negative reviews players wanting prerelease version actually trying release version dont let turn away gem adventurethe release version ton fun dont miss experience talent trees dont need watch bar fill add points tree feel fulfilled many games release expansions rendering earned gear useless game distills essence game zone exploring questing upgrade gear complete zone objectives youve completed zone story lore find setting neighboring land another adventureeach zone clean slate explore quest powerful artifacts crafting abilities learned last adventure continue help earning new gear area progression feels good instead farming top tier gear get point stat increase common games im actually earning huge upgrades move area areathe combat simple dynamic abilities use paired active dodge mechanic minimize damage take class feels unique different play style instead unlocking abilities making abilities marginally stronger via talent system abilities available get go scale suppose would downside youre minmaxer im regions varying size small ones able played hours double largest based experience biomes unique creatures features explore lava lakes undead crypts open savannahs dense jungles arboreal forests theres always something cool around next bendi really enjoyed alpha version game really enjoying release version core game quite enjoyableif youre looking voxel arpg massive procedurally generated world explore solo friends cube world worth try lots promises respected zone limited gear annoying leveling system disappeared game alpha basically better even content lots bad reviews peoples broken expectations game expected world wollay course dissapoined didnt release wanted look game without preconceptions fun entertaining game instead infinite leveling system mobs getting harder harder progress throught game wollay decided nurf character instead buffing monsters game progression rightfully annoy lot people game designed infinitly randomly generated world would bit silly mister powerful away beginning think people would less annoyed wollay made region locking items relivent law explain happens love keep good work love always loved wish key gear didnt disappear moving new zone find handglider boat times gets pretty annoying love concept would great game could pull ignorant development actually stripped away things game loved original alpha releaseunless great change affected game improve gameplay systems avoid titlethis game unfinished ridiculous cashgrab game actually presents love game although one thing bothering quest glitch save person enemies finished got loot reward map showed quest finishdone check alright minutes pass suddenly unchecks went completed time didnt get loot shows quest finished every minutes unchecks never quest goes forever dont get loot quest big deal doesnt show map finished annoying otherwise great game cant wait play love game also hoping future updates maybe stuff like housing love game ive played alpha version hundreds hours enjoyed every minute new content amazing dungeons new pets glider mechanics quest system especially things dont like unfortunately leveling system region loot skill trees lack lack skill trees makes leveling seem pointless getting diving skill isnt exactly usefull could choose points going would alot better adding skills might help well character movement speed increased attack speed damageregion loot seems kind silly things like glider boat especially reins incredibly frustrating noticed ocean biomes spawn boat first non village island land help alot reins large land biomes really sucks liked old version buy glider forever goes boat ability ride pets locked behind skill points unlocked forever character reset weapons armor top feel like im starting new character every biome wonder want progress character mean somethingapart things changes vast improvement older version hope review given good ideasthank giving us update always wanted maybe next time dont make us wait long love visuals audiolove classes races customizationlove explorationnot fan new progression system terrible love game came still love love game since alpha going new direction new release still love appreciate developers hard work artistic vision love game wollay please continue working great hope youre fine loved original release way back gotta say opinion region lock items really destroy big part fun game held changes back though start playing loved alpha still great spite strange ghosting went still back working lets get rid crappy area itemlock figure something else right youre punished exploration game made brilliant exploration loved alpha desisions progression systems overhaul bit bumpy ill still play lot thoughit least stay region feel like actual open world adventuring searching completing quests lot games genres fail think mainly procedural generation world makes everything find feel unique even though limited pool quests honestly think best way fix game fun hundreds hours like alpha completely overhaul progression system region locking feels like robs everything earned cross border essentially maybe go back exp system like maybe keep loot based keep scaling numbers dont know could still keep artifacts permanent bonuses think require bit impact unless made easier get loved simple infinite progression originalhell would love version exact new quest system loved game alpha still love yes things changed still lots funwould love travel artifacts persistent across areas would also make artifact progression meaningful gear thing doesnt really bother much maybe travel items bunch gold meaning dunno ill playing game regardless blast loved game since alpha thought game might never see light day lot changed since alpha making lot people question would go route region locking personally love new style game think makes endless fun without friends overall think issues game need ironed think wollay improve time lvl system meh overall pretty fun mainly hear make positive review cancel someones whiny self entitled review besides game fun came still fun play friends entitled brat friends get game simple major downgrade core gameplay loop progression system alpha version guess happens break trust paying customers develop years echo chamber make game make great people borderline worship disappear years come back update makes game simpler easier less content get end cube world waste time wait years make cube world great cant belive took years make sure talk npcs quests quest system game interesting unique gamethe game definitely gotten better since alpha days still major potential developer keeps rolling updates either wait reaches maximum purchase play along progressesill provide better review time play game make favor dont buy game least state man really wish love game cant man game clearing kind dungeon found one chests got excited chest would contain relic relic containing ancient lost power would get keep regions opened chest hoping wasnt going get something garbage like cool new skill good rare weapon like rare pet food rare cool pet please prayed give something awesomemy prayers answered hands held crown crown increased lamp radius oh wouldnt believe happy sarcasm aside dont think game worth grind gear lose except worthless movement speed stat lamp radius repeat repeat man heartbreak im sorry wollay tried bought loved alpha back going game years later heard sudden steam release happening couldnt believe played itand played aaaaaand played addition music awesome world expansive spent hours first part map eager next area flying high sky landing next zone ready pounce unsuspecting enemies theni got destroyed gear resets per zone utility gear disappears retrieved oh man wollaywhat want recommend people want tell give hope buti think gone notion makes really bummed real heartbreak man first heard cubeworld officially getting released tears joy hard recommend game cause much fun alpha justbetterdont get wrong game went sale like id recommend otherwise worth money clearing regions game pretty much fully played reality openworld game progression deep desert many content earlier alpha game missing makes game whole new better game many already voiced opinion thoroughly care however truly find wrong repeatedly tease numerous features people support release game include wollays sparse content updates fans years must quite aware picture game painting whether intentionally misleading followers gain interest truly intended develop things failed know however game feels less balanced beta version years ago barely additional content released passion project years state leads believe lost passion interest development cube world long ago merely attempt make money moving said still pleasant experience cant imagine people getting hours play youve seen content least twice wollay communicative changes least shown semblance care community people loved game years believe game could something special truly sad see turn like highly doubtful continue development game past point many others already detail explained problems game part agree gotten alpha interesting play nostalgia exploring one region intentions go another region redo running around looking loot overall benefit progress slightly larger lamp radius would barely recommend freetoplay many others wrote extensive reviews im gonna keep short game current state absolute disappointment made cubeworld fun endless exploration character progression gone fun alpha keep away massive changes core gameplay cubeworld personally like game also lacking many features promised picroma website wollay game enjoyable game purchased years ago one would buy massive disappointment alpha players watched game suddenly lose features try current state reward game gives completing regions small extension leaves reason play game combat never changes never gain skills shining moments first dungeons make pulls dungeons dont many tiles underdesigned saving grace game multiplayer made easy said dont rope friends buying dont buy basically idle clicker game without getting see numbers get bigger massive disappointment really feels like every new feature since alpha years ago makes game worse top removed bunch things well massive disappointment waiting literally almost half life im disappointed im writing review made refund request wollay please make game feel like alpha feels barebones massive step wrong direction hadhave high hopes game alpha cw fantastic base set stall much added already decent game lacking content way quests like ive idea prompted wollay redo scratch hope reverts similar state adding extra content came beta cant recommend unfortunately massively flawed region locked gear system lose progress walk far maybe give timei recommend game enjoying im forgiving person find fitting fairly nicely niche game different beast polarizing say leastmy hope game receive expansion future devs known silence general dont mind see deal breaks lot peopleif want use reviews good idea kind game check helpful section unless gets abused show reviews best describe arguments friends bought game released many years ago game alpha expected updated wollay ended abandoning game years must scrapped everything last month release ended reason hours friends tried hard like would lying said didnt good moments would much better purchasing terraria minecraft much better game design decisions game really make wonder wollay made certain decisions discussing laughing decisions part fun dont buy game although slight glimmer hope continue update game good engine meet cube world game lot potential developer abandoned game isnt bad actually enjoyed lot friends game okay im going give game idea functions already built actually kind cool youre indie developer best way abandon game leaving completely personally believe shall allow parts community modding even complete game feelings best thing look fallout fallout completely buggy bethesda allowed modding allowed many people add thousands upon thousands better solutions another point stable game one engine stable enough run without community bug fixing garrys mod time favorite game community developers thing garry team worry serious bugs memories good anymore still fun recommended might saddest thing steami like waited years think needs know people hate region thing dont like stuck see new couldnt keep first time experience may key like back first played also get friends key stand right worth eyes get sale might taste games didnt really grasp attention like alpha im gonna say updates changes dont recommend perspective million times better like back wouldve better creator open communicated audiencethough im really
