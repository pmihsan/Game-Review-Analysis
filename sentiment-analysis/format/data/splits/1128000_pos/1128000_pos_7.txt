gives reason kill anything else boss gold every thing isnt worth biggest issue game stems dev team taking years develop game taking single bit criticism fanbase let cubeworld go history cautionary tale happens develop games bubble without feed back people actually expect pay play product think negativity couldve easily avoided detailed poll discussion asking fans kind features theyd prefer stay change removed completely fans never given option instead blind sided game nothing like one already learned expect baffling design decisions although dedicated patient individuals may find fun still believe disappointment game far promised shown us beginning hope one day wollay wife take feedback consideration reboot game mans sky style give people really wanted get go brother bought game alpha

new region almost feels like groundhogs day different map layout would prefer wasnt regionlocked instead throwing legendaries region maybe dedicate region different color white regions easy yellow regions although tough could reap insanely high reward believe would keep elongate game yet give clearer end goal also please give us gliders boats permanently theyre fun mess around hate find one regionlastly weapon progression started got butt whooped time time kept trying different quests would easy enough handle without cheesing found mission beat got op blue greatsword destroyed everything path ease game jolted favor breezed everything got way support region color code idea make player work get best region get artifact let level go next region color scale progression would lot

dont even care goes like fps let see going computer quite shit therefore hard time running gamebut love game works years freaking awesome deserve love computer meets recommended specs completely unplayable lowest render distance things running background refunded immediately might check game later gets optimized better something dissapointment immersuralble day ruinedwhy implement clusterfuck progression system perfectly viable one alpha character cant progress besides gear region locked even abilities like riding pets gliding region locked selfdefeating purpose exploration want encourage people explore system shouldnt punish players leave new landscreate alternative mode game implements old gamesystem like advertised dont react wall silence cant handle pressure years since alpha seem decided say bother create different game skin cubeworld topi bought game play friends expectation would rpg like intentionally advertised rouge like selfhating shitfest favorite food ginseng soup fiance excited found coming reviews started going negative reading zone based gear got skeptical waited day deciding get try glad enjoy game thoroughly know lot people arent happy ones got alpha persons perspective didnt play alphafirst zone based gear know huge topic debate gear wasnt zone based soon finished first zone got best gear could easily start blasting zones wouldnt take long finish bunch crafting books zone would pointless wouldnt need materials crafting would become pointless well would need crafting starting new zone bad everyone making get keep mats easily craft starting gear collected enough also farm plus gear yet stay zone long enough bit daunting build new gear long know class fine also take advantage npcs world pulling enemies help defeat really need tomaterials zone restricted find spot load materials need make bunch gear mark map later visiting anytime especially find things like emeralds sapphires rubies diamonds materials brought zone zone stock piling things help greatly next zone quickly work better gear without grind hoursartifactsare pretty useless yes one point contestation game far aside dark night gets believe artifacts slightly enhance combat stats stead traveling ones traveling ones make pointless yes goal finish zone get artifact tbhthey feel like lot effort little reward artifacts got changed slightly enhance one combat skills light radius probably wouldnt mind would love themnighttime game sucks love idea game following normal day barely see light radius problem night lasts far long go sit town wait barely see order anything luckily see slightly farther fiance probably tv slightly brighter reason see enhancing light radius useful right find artifact itive heard useless find bunch havent found light radius ones well collected quite artifacts several different characters night didnt last long slightly brighter could barely see front feet wouldnt bad want artifact artifacts going still based pointless travel skills see night ft front characterpets amazing thing game point love finding pet food go tame new one love ride region find reigns dont like pets like shepherd dog example tamable right see shepherd dog looks amazing unlike collie terrier scottish terrier food tame shepherd dog seems wrongto end would say give game try form opinion esp didnt play alpha almost didnt based reviews wouldve mistake hours time writing review think definitely gotten monies worth esp seeing know going keep playing would love see classes get added know fiance excited see type mods come game gets easier friends well friends thinking life become easier still unsure always go find game play twitch youtube etc see think game play looks like something would like great doesnt potentially saved money thanks reading first review steam give thoughts gameso know game lets look closer game really badi played hours straight alone another hours cousinand say mean fun though also disappointed dont understand everything every choice wollay different game alpha starts bit slow dont know basically weak fucki dont mind hard games love dark souls every souls game dont mind mobs hard kill fun meand important change abilities changed keys keyboard middle mouse left shift r thats weird beginningat first armor like armours items region locked items name arent region locked well kind region locked go next area still use go far diminish like gear taken far obtained items bigger range work multiple regions need grind long find guess get armor quests somehow lucky got one could use next region wellon reddit saw comment finish region every gear name dont know true didnt finish region yetthe best option killing every boss enemy found exploring honest play coop arena region need find teleportation point near arena one die keep reviving run back arena life points dont reset dont know thats supposed happen thats farm every quests resets midnight go sleep village make quest till better gear thats dont think gear progression bad still dont like region locking stuffso armor items skills artefactswell every region find artefact yes level upyou find artefacts every land level gear firstso means gain levels finding artefacts levels raise stats least much mean provide small buffs permanent somewhat similar one point old skill tree also kind weird mean get lore see artefacts locations map thats least something guess still artefacts dungeons castles still need better stuff make dungeon guess back grinding killing monsters like chickenwhen played cube world cousin found pretty sick equipment looked dungeon artifact yes found one holy macaroni dungeons pretty sick really love loved every enemy every boss everything thought yes first artifact hell yeah well fucking increase riding skill like actual fuck dont even pet yea first impression artifact wollay make better well pretty simple wollay good programmer knows want least hope could make artifacts rewarding increase riding skill beating big dungeon good reward get artifact two stats like hp armor increase little two stats like riding swimming skill would rewarding fucking riding onlyhow find items talk npcs thats important find items landso tested multiplayer well cousin played found town region holy shit useless people petrified didnt know change googled guy reddit said need find people town petrified dont know one doesnt matter cause searched fucking hour guy know still didnt find thats really annoying lets move went another region proof armor really gets weaker items found dont work anymore surprise surprise since new region armor und items got useless mean equip armor good items inventory useless thats nicei mean armours one thing sure dont mind much players fuck cant take items another region glidersboatssome items arent permanent anymore like fuck would leave boat glider one region find new one another region thats annoying thinkmany complaint game xp levelling system like said level many say killing monsters useless well thats true need monsters new armor stuff gold think thats sounds clearly killing monsters important get better maybe dont big brain like everyone else complaining right nowso skill tree yes thats weird well cant level skills stuff like cant choose skill like alpha mean every skill beginning thats nice dont get iti mean dont mind arent getting xp anymore artifacts level dont know get boring good quests every land quest main quest little instruction would nice wollay thought would know something game know shitmost time walk game mean tried kill many mobs possible still need find npcs get quest walk another point thats probably site mapand couple time ago wollay said something building system game like would love build house region like happened hoped game sadly notfor map zoom much search everything region every stone cube life shrine tip mine mark everything map looks interesting every house everythingi like game somehow guess game choices made strange honest would prefer skill tree would nice hating wollay anyone game looks finished honest prefer alpha absolutely loved game still love alpha dont like game much mean really disappointed maybe hyped game dont know stuff wollay beta really dont like maybe need time get used itbut still dont see future game starting basically new every region great reward know dont start nothing next area gear still losing equipment found isnt nice dont change levels next area first area normal next area next one one maybe wrong game developer trying helpand know would love take stuff wollay added beta put alpha would amazing still recommend game fun finish first region thanks reading first game review dont judge couldnt stand back see negativity slightly unpolished gemthe game first steps real release impatient many years im happy finally offical already thought game deadnow biggest negativ points everyone experience already made equipment useable regions use equipment extra surrounding regionsscreenshot proof found sword extra legendary castle go regions away location found cant use properly anymore least cant play friend cause high distance travel eagle city friend directly free currently level ups collect artifacts stats get slight boost give level also see screenshots im level collected artifact also stayed went regions away classes special skills class skills also change specialization example rogue class ninja assassin true many skills skilltree im hoping change futurestill im hoping good updates near future hope cube world community still support game gets positiv attention likely pushed updates ppl buy push positivity p first six hours game wonderful played two friends blast exploring finding new gear quests ectafter nothing upon entering second biome found stats reduced nothing yellow legendary gear gray gear gear region locked besides rare gear find isnt locked adjacent zones crafting gear improving completely pointless start new biome movement equipment reigns mount pets boats ect also region locked boating ocean sudden boat disappear find things every zone order use themthe progression leveling game based around finding artifacts final dungeons zones take hours get thing increase stats mounted speed glider speed ect actual combat progression literally start every zoneother game fun youre comfortable paying six hours content id say give try beyond cant recommend game current stateupdate developers deleted facebook pages game bug reporting threads developer blogroadmap looks like wollay pulling another wollay dont expect updates game certainly dont buy first thought played game excellent game since release years ago exp system hard starting extremely hard find mobs actually killother good gamedont buy fix region lock playable friend gave gift guess enjoying wanted play togetherafter hour playing really dont like game find boring empty confusing seriously lacking objective sortthis game looked awesome videos experienced nothing like heck supposed get start theremy friend said need use guide even quests certainly arent obvious find ridiculous dont believe game hold hand dont think toss obvious quests goals even damn leveling system tell everything bland dont want play anymore regret purchased alpha cant get refundthis game isnt originally intended advertised everything everyone enjoyed alpha gone place kind halfassed breath wild wannabe except botw fun game many decisions devs made leave scratching head anyone could think gameplay loop would enjoyable longevity beyond youve done one every biome arent huge amount youve pretty much seen done everything infinitely replayable action rpg like alpha set bedont expect regular updates communication devs youre laughing think theyre going fix kind timely manner doubt theyll want fix dont seem think bad moral story keep passion projects free accept donations whatever start sell obligation customers reviews reflect obligations observed theyve done whatever wanted game without letting customers know thing baited alpha ol switcheroo isnt game paid originally advertised id never paid first place well opinion game may change future however cant recommend game current formula running around gathering special items get gear quests brings dungeons collect artifacts starting againthe aesthetic charming game lacks substance replayability looking buy would recommend waiting month developer address issues game currently fortunately theyve updating regularly opinion game complicated dont get wrong really love game cute art amazing programing skills lot game goes sale would buy worth played game friend believe better play friend wish content exploring lands dev youre reading love homo could add content make exiting thank youpuma original review game hopes would actually continually supported wollay seems gone mia whether working major update silence like originally working game left money whatever reason original review longer matterscube world game could amazing especially early beta days however unless like grinding essentially progression reset new zone recommend game current state unless find download mods enhance herethe concept game graphical design great lack progression removal original core concepts weapon upgrades via cubes skill trees means nothing much aside exploring zone completion obtain one item

remotely like alpha released years ago game took massive step backwards anywhere near good alpha legitimately somehow went backwards pirate alpha better bad everybody says still downgrade alpha appreciate mechanics like pet armor quest system hope get expanded however think become better game levels skills dungeons mechanics alpha overall experience playing started rough soon got hang really fun running around region exploring different areas fun wished lots work needs done game perhaps bring back old systems mechanics make fun good alpha bad people make hope gets better tho good alpha imo sad years good would hope still fun time friends bad best spend lot time feel like nothing big fan u basically get nothing getting artifacts everytime u go new zone like starting scratch gets really really repetetive feel progression even close original game however large community behind game began modding add back progression system overall great game long download mod fix little

levels removed since aplha buildthese atrifacts boring give bonus speed boat gliding speed lantern rangeand little values less month later still broken state impressed game bought six years ago gone cant comprehend whats done time tell game becomes whole region locking equipment boggles mind skills levels hope return former glory regions seem reskins previous time cant recommend game like alpha huge waste time money game walking sim like alpha still funmods make better like old game unfortunately like much content questionable decisions gear works travelling new biome makes gear worthless farm new gear new biome makes efforts worthless implement leveling back game farming pretty tiring especially want craft higherlevel gear requires long grind hrs max lvl breastplate get resources need really underwhelming rewards finishing bossdungeon biome ie radius lamp gets tiny bit bigger breathe bit longer underwater fun first hours arriving point undergeared quest grind materials better equipment really takes flow game wouldnt buy much fun typical type game played amazed much game fun recommend anyone wow played long already im hooked glad came steam hopefully see good development soon really much reviewer goes similar players alpha player changes game quitedisappointing lot things loved game gone skill trees leveling castle design map showed places youve exploration theres lot could talk everyone else pointed far greater detail anything im hoping wollay sees wake call ignored everyone warned releasing beta full version never talked community anything wants improve become better game dev needs learn take criticism communicate community also tutorialguide would nice one doesnt require go look online really sure went wrong used great game recommended currently game turned roguelite pretty bad one thati lot fun game bought back alpha solid rpgexploration foundation couldve built upon past years recommended buy unless sit underneath rainbow kettle filled goldtldr lots potential lightyears away finished lacks new content discover repetitive updates empty promises objectively seen game offers nice graphics like style gameplay choose preferred fighting class customisation options character head straight game understanding mechanics easy fighting requires patience world huge offers variety biomes region goals achieve basically keeps repeating real storyline could tell multiplayer nice addition however seemed fairly wonky dialogues repetitivebut development dilemma many years back game came alpha stage people hyped extremely time updates progress whatsoever anymore game dead years dev returned twitter lots new info features full version release date since post release steam sep one single update even information dev vanished againi sad cant recommend game wish told going sure happened game really isnt fun compared alpha version direction hoped felt alpha much better wow giving hours see much actually pains play game bought back game completely redesigned things loved game player progression levels meaningful exploration skills fair mobs fair zonesthe game longer character progression theres levels theres longer xp fighting mobs hopefully loot drop pointless force explore zone whenever enter new zone gear youve worked hard either killing mobs crafting becomes locked reenter zone skills gone mobs insanely poorly scaled entire zone supposed represent low high leveling zone since game procedurally generated pass zone literally everything could one shot order get closest townfor fault old game sat without update whole years times game become today launch onto steam without infinite leveling skills meaningful mob encounters ability meaningfully explore without feeling like youve kicked teeth every time cross white zone boundaryi really loved game got first update years im left caring game bought many years ago like itfar perfect pretty great nonetheless game anticipated expected lot potential doesnt reachthe beginning quite hard difficulty overwhelming get fun play though also doesnt last longso early game end game arent fun time inbetween fun alpha could said minecraft years still fun deserve hate got remember amount nostalgia repair irreparable ill keep wish list things chance follow mean time good moment design appears pull different directions different alpha amount things fairly low repetitive hoping improves cant recommend expected expect weird minecraft knockoff pleasantly surprised see something wholly original incorporating rpg elements well adventure blocky world colossal world explore hard properly enjoy game first start find one item become breeze usually shy away games mixed results honest really deserves positive reviews isnt bad game sense really dont see gets much hate expected like hoped game biggest waste time ive played wow yearsill add context later time used still kind good weve promised years agoi wish meme unironically bootleg minecraft mods play better mechanics someone actually thought regionbiome locked gear dumbest thing ive ever experienced game thats reason wont let start steam online restart offline mode launch game otherwise cw crashes right depression etci get needed time deal personal life development hard etc etc honestly consumer disappointed years ago ran away money like iirc still multiply thousands people bought alpha years receive nice got steam keys bought alpha state game quite awful worth worth worth worth years worth game play people friends steam mostly walking simulator rather much exploration progression plus wolly already stopped patching posting twitter daily release top deleted apology blogspot lol worth beta testing years worth full price theres guidance new player worth current state worth get told otherwise worth worth money expect updates got game worth worth year wait worth money right worth money alpha better worth money repetitive grinding low rewards want money fixed know alpha tweets woley looks way betterleveling pointless cant tell hype wollay resurfaced baffles see much work discarded worth money game trash year wait bust changes make game bad would get money back could hopefully sells one else make less butt worth time least version anyways try alpha download internet look mins find enjoy enough maybe consider buying version isnt piracy though worth wait least still alpha installed worth wait worth wait want good version cube world seek copy alpha unfinished game ten times better finished game doesnt help devs dissapeared removing blogs tweets trace ever returning clean mess madei dont want dislike game ive following years isnt cube world people wanted worth money unless serious improvement works worth time money would rather add another hours alpha playing another minute downgrade yet warning completely different game compared alphathe quest lore really nice make world feel realfor im missing longterm goal goal game right seems completing whole region find artifact makes one abilities bit better swimming riding gliding start useless gear new zone repeat process starting new region tough since dont glider boat etc yetbeing able swim bit faster isnt enough progression really amazing goal end gameso game potential thoughill update review changes anything significantafter releasing game officially developpers havent shown sign life notei alpha player review specifically game stands currently comparison alpha currently hours game say enjoyed time experiencing game offer several problems game granted time well spentso gameplay get thrown right tutorial explanation levelling system nothing quests nothing villages bosses anything go explore learn everything approach first objective find village people along way literally talk everyone wouldnt attack exaggeration everyone didnt would probably miss something important could hidden areas items bosses yea talk everyone theres indication may tell gotta suck painful dialogalong way advise killing weak things weak arent class rip sir even probably rip still may drop leftovers items thatll use thats bonus may even drop types food use get pets attack ride later find reins fun thati also advise getting many shrines along way arent forced walk way againso talk people may tell go find things may tell areas attack find gnome needs saving cool ay yeah chances youve talked many people found little bother next thing youd want find something thatll allow easier travel youve found someone tells glider boat andor reins great well bad buddy maybe ya got things maybe dont probably latter time miniquests people probably gave theyre high challenge level youll go exploring check map find areas look like house enemies hopefully within range first trying go whiteone star areas easiest completing allow easier progression along explorations take low levelled mobs hope equipment lets say youve followed intended progression talked many people within map youve got great equipment ready face biggest dungeon get artifact everyone telling exciting right permanent perk help future journeys awesome boost yeah okyou blast way right end maybe theres chest end castle perhaps go open amazing found found erdiving staminaamazingyea okso youve got brilliant perk thatll help future endeavours awesome time grind keep boosting statsnext biomeeverything inventory disappears boat using travel biome gone youre middle ocean currently equipped items useless within area yikeshave fun amazing seriousnessthe perks game utter garbage course losing boat glider reins suck anything feeling able completely grind biomes constantly always sort goal throughout game actually great fun enjoy constantly able repeat enjoyed within game progression exploration boss battles awesome things actually advise game isunlocking way allow special items constantly available throughout gamebetter artifects current ones feel worthless incredibly disappointing biome complete lot build grinding something bad ruins moment finishing biome nothing say hasnt already said million times better ways could used rough gem lot potential instead ground dust snorted rip cube world nothing like used back dev ghosted everyone dont waste money nothing like wollay changed main mechanics game beyond would followed original development road map would fallen love great game second time unfortunatethat said hope people enjoying new update dont like doesnt mean wont nothing like alpha barebones alpha hey like exploring thats decent sightseeingwalking simulator nothing like original promised years ago loot changes every different biome enter youve never played may enjoy one played alpha playing nothing like promised product dont get wrong really like game way play start upon entering new region simply avoid enemies unless want tank water mage yes thats right tankiest class healer areas really cool new dungeons special items fast travel others really make enjoyable bad begins upon starting adventure entering new region enemies difficulty static never change throughout game speaking levels experience longer thing anymore power armor weapons feels like makes game lot less free must progress direction game makes honestly bought alpha play instead many others included find enjoyable game boring beginner cube world frustrating mobs atacks game dont tutorial played friends wasnt interesting dont buy game want play wait udpates lot people still upset whole region locked gear thing honestly love game ive played solo far im playing scout game truly amazing applaud devs coming far cant wait play friends kind like region locked gear allows focus exploration rather becoming op anyways obviously opinion honestly recommend getting really great game ive read couple reviews seems biased expectations game turned starting alpha backhowever nature games developer progress coming along slowly obviously leaves game negative reviewswith review attempt biased although played alot alphacube world open world rpg current nature simplisticit gets repetetive fairly quickly might yield players hours worth play time game play alpha maybe morethe game fully explored much time invested imagine people getting bored point endgame stagehowever things badcube world excels ability casually play without friends moments notice able go run cube world much like roguelike games even varying groups friendsto seemed like game cool similar stardew valley action packed rpgit delivered different sense adventure refreshing changea change much enjoyedtldrgiven time taken release really room

even really help adorable game frustrating shell inferior version alpha came many years ago want good cube world game see get alpha honestly disapointment probably isnt worth money oh god stay away fixed game best left alpha progression every enemy overpowered get lucky drop world static bombs nothing crafting shoehorned worthless zones dont reward crafting resources nonexistent game loading issues physically hurts playif reason play go ocean biome chance oh boy cube world quite rollercoaster let explain whyyou start creating character far good soon spawn notice pretty quickly almost everything kills fast instantly unless find stray cow health potions tough ride like first couple hours assure enoying kiting chicken minutes doesnt kill mebut luckily also representative game actually offer get gear get quests find village quite smooth sailing actually start kill stuff without dying every two mobs combat starts become dare say fun wollay pixxie put quite lot content game zone progression feels really fun rewardingonce get good enough gear around purple yellow start endgame content zone comes form multiple larger dungeons get increasingly difficult go end usually rewarded called artifact pickup increases level though stats gives minor bonus something like swimming climbing speed dungeons quite fun artifacts get quite worthless aside bragging rights wollay decides change something useful definitly see becoming quite enjoyable endgameafter complete zone gameplay loop begins since gear carry new zone isnt bad play bit imoall cube world definitely fun game albeit somewhat lacking aspects namely early game progression form artifacts issues something hard change believe refinements game truly become gem people making alphato finish tips early game becomes easier form tutorial game find village asap looking brownish collections rectangles world map weapons armor vendor pretty much every village stock basic gear attack white mobs npcs help also attempt stronger ones white quests award gear class actually start become stronger oh boy game start remember six years ago alpha came excited get hands get chance around week ago get notification wollay twitter saying cube world would released couldnt believe eyes game came instantly wanted buy however waited good week reviews start coming surprise majority new reviews negative read reviews said thing game boring completely different originally point pretty worried state game reading reviews watching videos gamei bought cube world today instantly realized people negative towards game game one word boring combat terrible unless fighting something star rarity dont either die get really close dying world feels empty stale time want better gear need pray rng gods even get drop first place even might get something cant even use progression stale gets boring fast essentially consists running around region quests strong enough gear take last dungeon complete said dungeon get relic gives small mean small bonus mostly mobility stats fact pour much time completing region small boost mobility stats honestly absurd concept grind satisfying rewarding fun cube worlds grind none things besides whole region locking relic concept leveling system another big issue overall think game specific audience enjoy playing cube world think means try right recommend game anyone looking fun engaging adventure game didnt pour much time shadow cube world used everyone else legitimately could barely play hour oh boy time changed design game drastically billed game possible centralized servers localized servers friends join adventure play harmoniously dungeonexplorationlooter type game instead well somethingi got game day launched wayyyyy back day loved alpha challenging much fun group feels like island measure success removed crossing invisible line oh well guess didnt waste bucks least oh good lord guys back got game first came circa later dropped face earth favor dont waste time oh wish review know really love concept game much room grow game good shines incredibly fails fails hard really drags rest experience region locked armor okay shouldnt become useless maybe region locked equipment atrocious makes ocean biomes feel awful theyre boring empty nothing unique except lots empty water monsters like used combat fun taking skill tree made made game unique fun less rewarding linear hope allows us keep reins regions eventually exploring isnt fun rewarding anymore chore great ideas held back extreme manner way make getting reinssailboats fun make give stat bonuses anything crippling movement game movement limited please listen game could incredible theres much listen community believe old system flawed ideas fix failed executing improve make wanted also really hope plan adding new classesraces addition sprucing biomes old cube world felt open boss fights felt much grand overall think good game maybe right improvements patches make enjoyable unique experience change doesnt happen shift review abandon hope dont think caseedit dev abandoned game doesnt speak fans trash game please buy oh man cube world hell years months game enjoying hearing months word devs remained hopefulmonths assuming devs ran moneydev posts random twitter update years nothing people hype others skeptical smartyears go dev posts randomly changes acts like nothing happenedsome guy gets email response dev ignorantly faithful fans act like second coming hate anyone says otherwise blindly praising devsyears later game comes alpha buyers play game question content isignorant fanbase defends devs lives anyone criticizes game mean devsdays go ignorant fanbase finally gets buy gametone immediately changes see criticism called forhere todayleveling removed progression removed exploring removed fun removed gear essentially removed cant taken regions without significant nerfing synthetically add progression game much like slap face cant even bring boat ocean found different region tooltips abilities information use skillsnot mention things talked website back day things tweeted none fully implemented things barebones basic forms ideastldr game hyped much devs ran money come back years later act like nothing happened promise game give concept oh man start loved game released bought soon available loved alpha disappointed game abandoned back years whats changed well quite lot actually random map generation seeds gone presumably stop people sharing seeds like known locations gearbosses xp system gone traditional leveling system many skills also skill tree since xp system removed really isnt reason kill monstersmobs come across drop rate gear depressingly low longer award xp quickly became clear better run away themthe system replaces inherently bad shifts focus game become roguelike rpg fine thats wollay going problem new system fully developed completely fine want strip away players weaponsgear zones lasting progression somewhereright artifact system scratch spend time clearing zone artifact award swimming speed useless stat increase items stripped leaving zone start scratch next zone essentially wasted time make current system worth losing old one artifacts would need serious overhaul grant significant useful buffs whether useful stat increases unique skillsi cant recommend game grossly overpriced whats developer doesnt best track record reliability communication oh year since game officially released naive purchased game alpha years ago thinking would turn something like minecraft seeing abandoned past first alpha instantly made realize game would never exist supposed marketed dev blames anxiety sharp lash back alpha perfectionist game never got regular updates reality dont think ever made extensive plan work instead opted work complete vacuum without outside input instead became like gigantic cash grab aimed gamers looking next big open world procedural generated adventure gamei tried cube world released steam get final opinion changes made alpha utterly terrible cant find reason call game fun even worth purchasing release built poorly thought design changes nothing changed better end honestly alpha content progression final release game wolfram von funck list worst indie game developers right along side yandere dev game summed vaporware point dont see ever improved upon significant way future avoid costs ok honestly like game yes doesnt compare old game charm game still hope possibly play old version opinion fun game ok backed game first announced played lot heard coming back hyped hell think game took wrong steps went backwards skill tree alpha gone reason levels less gone outside artifacts give level mention artifacts kind useless dont anything great buff fast travel world even big deal reallyyou lose gear go across line unless gear star gear dosent also lose glider tools like bother leaving one area lose stuff start makes real sense point view know one point view makes try new items yea yea better way want make happen like shouldnt lose gear cross line get back got back line thats kind stupid punishes exploration dont know old alpha different system spawn one point got spawn harder enemies got better stuff dropped way better system far ok ive played many many hours alpha cw game steam waited years opinion wollay misunderstood time game godly thoughtful mean real locking system isnt bad need loot items want rush game explore etc talk fly master left click wherever want go youre done complete region collect artefact take arround time took alpha walk onei think system perfect want play someone new start biome come back one later easy cost nothing youve unlocked teleport status honnest leveling good feel progression peapols played cant talk artefact obtain lvl artefacts faster friends complete region easily moreover quests incredibly cool never mobs etc arena done time per day allow better gears time took explore whole biome alpha compensated fly master free teleportation friends teleportation status ocean find boat first land walk etc thougt nearly everything dont even want talk dongeon randomly generated like everything loots quests map region weapons artefactsto conclude game nearly perfect honest would like keep mount region would like little quests like kill ghost get gold idk whatput back spell bar really cool alpha worst cant put spirit wings shoulder really sad buy game dont listen everyone even need play proper opinion play dont like ask refund like case write comment steam tell think gamethanks wollay love ok game pretty good like minutes bad nothing developer disapeared return years steal money still hope leftat least game colorful ok second region lol ok right game completely unplayable wont work anything windowed mode spend minutes trying get ui screen right size impossible windowed mode causes ui disappear behind border game running slow rig tried every fix found internet none worked hopefully much work one day playable im glad didnt buy ok heres real review people want factual recommendation game thoughts crazilybiased temper tantrumso start cube good game opinioncube world open rpg game pick classes yata yata yata youre really good stuffso yes zone lock yes lose regular gear go another zone h w e v e r craft gear admittedly take lot time use zones away zones take hours complete making gear good around hours playtime ive waiting game years along lot people im disappointed yeah sure artefacts bit useless people dont seem understand cube world longterm game dont want users get max gear hours get bored game like kind mans land games cube world tries make playerbase excited brand new randomly generated quests every zone side note playing like hours special items like gliders spikes etc zone locking isnt really timeconsuming im trying force like want clear shit since kids like raging poor little level system gone precious skill tree taken away even though made game better dont like dont play need ass ok wait minute everyone need chill understand guys upset gear locking added ways get around gear locking plus artifacts supposed go understand guys upset heard stuff first played beta tester agree game good game need bit work far think worth wait okay listen goes years ago man pressured releasing alpha wasnt ready amazing years work depression sadness almost giving released project people hate people love love whyin alpha four classes levels played shit got gear class easy mode lets explore cube world beta first thing gonna notice weird progression system levels gone gear based however lose non gear moving new zone lot people hate think keeps game fresh im explore instead becoming powered restart move new zone explore new area get gear small advantage start yea miss skill tree levels reality alpha could get maxed skill tree hourthe classes fun ive played degree personal favorite water mage heals thats powered also assassin rogue game play solid game runs greatso orginal cube world player beta tester man always wanted something like recommend game love explore dont mind exploring basically rpg rogue like instead dying restarting restart mostly next would wait years okay first things first amazing game best advice give ignore negative reviews grumpy cause game isnt exact game played years ago new features feel fresh new loads fun play multiplayer need stop thinking rpg rougelite okay reviewed game minutes playtime currently hoursthis probably serious review ever writeas extremely excited game come alpha goodi really want like game ive waited years update remember years old playing alpha friends skype lot fun game cube world years ago better think leveling system game really good concept possibly best one ive ever seen spawn region im pretty sure always spawn near city go city talk bunch npcs occasionally give tips mark items bosses maponce get good gear armor youre finally strong enough go dungeon dungeons possible find artifact artifacts increase level would best leveling system game ive ever played increased actual useful stats probably biggest downside game region locking every single thing get region locked except artifacts would given game positive review would way increase damage permanently maybe regions like times bigger theres point continuing play game weapons armor become useless quickly dont get emotionally attached items remember id always rename tools minecraft made feel personal always really sad whenever id lose pickaxe bow whatever game wont hesitate sell bow ive playing game mods fix region lock havent tried yetive bit fun game near enough amount fun back alpha dayswollay believe fix game okay first give game chance alpha owner got participate closed beta agree silly mechanics regionlocked items still find enjoyable im sure time goes one favorite multiplayer games friends team coordination help games difficulty im playing solo water mage dont every find hard nothing could done better yes agree balance isnt impossible promotes team play ive waited years game get im happy cause better nothing okay lets face alpha sure way better developers trying still fun game dont get wrong still reccomend players arent like whole review section protesting bring back features alpha shouldnt abandon game thats right yeah happy exists couldnt even play alpha okay lets try ive forcing keep playing started thinking maybe reason dont like game different sure isnt well flushed game made one person know get getbad things starting probably hardest thing looking materials craft base gear survive hard running monsters high level finding lot materials crafting seems spread make something requires workbench saw loom furnace campfire etc seems pointless things one item craft sure plan add things future feel able craft everything one would better considering limited amount things craft aswell craftable thing seen interacting said thing else stuck looking bottom corner see made also percentage complete region isgood thingsas said starting game hard ball starts rolling keeps going starts getting bigger knew hopping stars stars weapon armor rating another thing feel saturated games babying us everything mean telling us go mind dont know much game worked discovering things learning things well kinda felt started play minecraft first time knowing nothing learning went npcs great help learning things sure always look found figuring much rewarding cant tell silly feel take every type tamable items see thats want id say come game open minded might enjoy attempt something differentoverall alright game id say give try money okay every said clearly perspective information acquired game game made man wife even attacked online ddosing possible things heard lead believe rather game players project wolfram von funck wife sarah von funck tell story create experience world created possible something else basically form world building thought make think game niche following personally like directions wolfram gone helps sell sense exploration idea treading would unknown arent even part world hope wolfram wife take everything community says including pinch salt hope cube world becomes game happy hope dont put risk trying please people said still good critical remember try distinguish subjective dissatisfaction objective one small summary general thoughts lets get beefy part review tips playing game endokay im going try explain believe main component game use comparison going thoughts new leveling system personally think benefits component im going use dark souls specifically first one maybe majoras mask botw game share something handle exploration certain degree use idea world building create experience mean gain direction purpose npcs curiosity explore world similarities end mind cube world dark souls two side coin dark souls like climbing mountain journey like trial idea climbing mountain climb mountain sites going bonus dark souls like mind driving force end part defeat boss reach end cube world opposite side coin dark souls joy game come execution exploration way journey feels play breaths life world created may play new regions systems give little bit mental stimulus actively want complete much possible region also giving new challenge move next region region complete starting progress become easier easier best way explain fun time spent scouring map thing looked interest well talk every npc felt wonderful play playing game quickly learnt importance prepared use every thing power gain advantage make journey easier play game feels less like playing game beat boss complete much regions possible feels like encapsulation experience exploring world unknown chucked clue go make decision based info collect locals new world feel like really amazing book draws create thoughts stories part world book drawn cube world feels leans towards tool wolfram wife build world tell story kind enough let us join ride us region lock system makes sense mind tool maybe even accidental makes appreciate world two people poured heart soul intothat said still interactive experience make beginning steps learn interact game easier grasp lack knowledge tools cause great experience fall horrible one feel one greatest flaw cube world lack means learn tools controls case even controls uses f keys learn characters ability might resize map list controls someone searching something find game twitter post creator might sound like cant real people dont use social media heck barley touch facebook even though account life twitter wolframs wifes tweets im massive fan cube world cube world didnt exist would taken much longer use twitter maybe wouldnt use tools learn game found within game thing game made two people tested two people course wouldnt think adding certain thing doesnt come mind look something already know conclusion hope streamline learning process controls maybe even making key bindings fully customizable would greatly help learning interact world built enjoyable rather struggle find tweet mentions certain button maybe hint npc games title screen like npcs normarly something important say would add loti hope continue create game proud im ready sit sidelines enjoys stuff create okay think obvious biased review obvious love game new leveling system may perfect much refreshing old system much prefer thing game see passion project something worked spare time might wrong feels something poured hearts still live daily lives possibly working another job okay way everything logs mushrooms roots heart flowers etc need carry everything afraid use eagle going new areas always prepared enough recourse buy craft next basic weapon possible even rely npcs yes help full look map go ration scale use view map places interest okaythe game isnt bad got lot better alpha noticeable better quests better look animals better combat items artifacts etc god region lockat beggining wasnt worried mean could grow power sounded cool concept soon tried changing lands since ive trouble find artifacts specials checking last stuff remaining noticed wasnt small downgrade like oh yellow legendary gear uh green wharever think wasnt even white gear suredont misunderstand game good worth wait would buy could think downgrade region lock much tm missing stuff like tameable cows fixing pathfinding monsters principally flying onesin alpha progressed slowly could keep done went legendary like days hours cant keep progress insteadrecommended grinders specially old game better soooooooo trash merits cube world fairly flawed game however enjoyed current format say however price far high amount content game still early access title support garenteed add content id say might worth watch content incredibly lackingwait see game improves buying wait see support continued wait sale maybe bucks itll worth playing right however positivei rarely enoucntered bugsupgrading weapons allows make look uniqueits really complicated builtit works smooth little demandon negative sideit lacks form explanation tutorial figure even basic thingsbalance place npc players imo classes good subclass bad onetotal region lock sucks youre done region almost entire gear becomed useless onmy lucky items might foundoutside progress region progress level finding artifacts real impact levels matter artifacts give minor upgrade stuff like latern range swimming speedit smells bit like abadonware compatibility windows supported know many people choose windows familar fixed would recomend itthe game experience self amazing sucks go way pc bank pay per hour play cube world beautiful beginnings game oh tragedy occurred one day remembered game searched found going get released got hyped playing new release felt huge disappointment amazing game turned trash still updates release hope fix somehow im still hopeful one giant problem progressing zone actually pretty fun knowing playtime lose worth going different zone disheartening game needs kind long term progression artifactsystem hardly meaningful mei played hundreds hours alpha gameplay fun felt rewarded every gear level upgrade game lots potential future one best games ive ever played one best rpg played far one biggest hypeblueballing cases ive ever seen im probably saying every negative review gonna say extreme disappointment years eager undying loyalty zealous fan base understand developer struggled depression life family job etc spend years posting updates game making progress towards games stretch goals would hope see least newly released version feels like someone else took reigns designed game light barely original planned features especially highly coveted xp advanced skill tree systemsas game feels like big chore simulator rpg spend hours completing continent unfulfilling noncombat stat boost reward go another continent lose equipment thing theres motivation explore continue especially find highest quality weaponsarmor lying ground five minutes zone would expect finding stuff many hours would satisfying good payoff work alpha didnt ton content either actually felt like adventure could play many hours look back see much progress youve made traveling far leveling etci hope game eventually becomes originally meant instead embarrassment guess thats developer decides communicate community fade away ill gladly change review ever happens hopes arent high fun multiplayer gets pretty boring restarting progression zone fun mods shell former self beautiful concept likely never see light day ever rest peace cube world short fun restart anew every country opinions subjective opinion piece let stop enjoying game different thoughtsim frustrated game turned im disappointedi bought alpha game way back years ago friend mine told blast play time infinite leveling skill points really added fun though balanced gameplay experience time decent bit planned content wollay developer laid website excited games futureradio silence became common theme wollays development small bits pieces would thrown way every months never updates time hear finally happeningso get timewe got artifacts give lackluster boosts ive ever seen range glider speed around lamp radius boost things youre supposed exploring tell sounds appealling none combat related theyre exploration based weak buffs thatwe got xp skills reworked entirely levels artifact locked power comes entirely gear xp entirely removed instead kill random mobs small sums gold chance getting item color difficulty skill points also removed hell cant even read skills game new help button tells keybindings name skillwe got region locked gear cant go another region keep power unless gear giving power go new area fun gameplay mechanic none rewards fun engaging give power go new region weak artifacts new biomethe map generation weaker alpha quite honest exploring felt like chore anything else go talk npcs get quests location info isnt easy way filter new information kinda spam talk everyone see hope dont comment liking name top best way find respawn shrines look map zoom glaze eyes entire region hardly fun way playlastly want mention planned content told would new classes skill trees main stories cities fair bit back alpha released much currently build none mentioned im aware development changes time wollay hasnt addressed concern lack also hasnt really touched questions surrounding changes core game doesnt respond points dont support decision toa lot issues subjective decent bit people enjoy game applaud enjoying game youre one people gave shot couldntthere minor details take issue already said hasnt made case wouldnt change anything eitherto concludei bought alpha enjoyed would buy game stands today original review hrs gameplay thumbs downunpolished rpg becomes polished walkingsim lack persistent loot lack questing direction lack skill leveling somehow feels alpha alpha truly mystifying game developmentedited review hrs gameplay thumbs felt need give another shot expectations playing way game seems want played honestly feel bad giving thumbs originally true game absolutely alpha cannot play like played alpha cannot enjoy like may enjoyed alpha transformed entirely early complaints eventually rectified discovered new albeit sometimes hidden qualityoflife features additions alltogether extremely improved game lack persistent lootwhile initially feels like youve robbed goodies enter new region think ultimately compelling balance feature lets get much region forces explore really adventure properly new area cakewalking across world dressed nines legendaries go find new legendaries lack questing directionthis easytalk people theyll give direction could want use shrines tp nearest landmark dive parts map havent yet explored lack skill levelingleveling occur slow wont give perk points spend system completely revamped gear primary source strengthening abilities found map likely first quests locals give youthis game pretty tech demo overall highly recommend alpha patrons must understand alpha better originally created around cube world special place heart oldschool kind rpg handholding tutorial massive world get dropped figure rest really though need wiki con among ones tutorial game little sparse content well major overarching plot complete zones basically restart zero every time enter new zone unless find weapons tend pretty damn rare ive personally sank many hours game steam completing zones also isnt incredibly rewarding since artefacts level give real stat bonuseswhat game going personality styling two peoples creative vision shows gameplay although repetitive enjoyable world absolutely gorgeous day ceased amaze doubly randomly generated recommend personally wait diamond dug dirt polished gem truly unlike many reviewers seemsif want complete finished game play find flaws move however want see trove likes would like actually good originally reviewed game positively last year week stopped playing sat inventory collecting dust like fair enough personally could refund probably would people already done good job explaining happened whats wrong recommended current state hours far good reason people giving negative reviews dont like game different alpha however never played alpha look game instead used say right game fun enjoy new progression system little caveat artifacts game stat items persist throughout regions give movement boosts even still good hours theres mods let artifacts boost combat stats give real progression well mods add xp system back game mind definitely worth money overall fun game problems overall improvement alpha build available since many reviews failed mention quite questionnable game design choices mainly resetting gear stats every time go new area overall game tries succeeds providing series fun adventures similar yet varied enough environments smidge metroidvaniaas improvements mainly hope better way provide new challenges found resetting gear stats previously mentionned maybe quests get varied multiple steps lore intensive quests shown dev blog posts actually implementedtldr unfairly criticized great start needs followed overall enjoy game missing lot even release biggest thing riding pets leveling unless consider picking new gear leveling far tell doesnt exactly work towns found everything petrified look forward seeing game grow develop hard say gamedefinitely fun run around friends though psa dev ran away blog deleted steam moderators pushing mods fix game modding isnt even supported pretty iffythe uglywindows doesnt work dont buy windows play anymore audio engine changed doesnt support windows crash desktop launch critical issue moved topthe devs went dark years stripped features already game shown features never made game progression consists farm get pointless artifact level get gear farmed stripped level counter many artifacts effectively pointless uninteresting game suffers usual issues procedural generated worlds everything feels first time found game used moddable quite easily code obfuscated databases stored binary data opposed normal database like used specifically changed way serves make modding game harder badthe game properly screenshot something like puush engine doesnt like gives screenshot last time tabbed spins camera wildly meaning cant even game systemtabbing makes game go fake window mode minimized takes full monitor one monitor cant tab borderless fullscreen mode fix itskill trees got removed spawn skills changed better used hours spawned making stronger lower cooldown like beforethe level system counter many flashlight distance upgrades joking tabbing switching fake window means even users several monitors instead instant like takes several seconds waiting tab back insome features kept game useless ridiculously grind heavy like crafting bad gear taken hour gameplay costs less go buy better gear trader reason craft anything six ten times expensive requires go hunt materials tens hours one item time worse gear could bought instantlymages terrifyingly overpowered hitscan enemies perfect aimbot accuracy using damaging weapons game need abuse ai stunlocks multiple people working together usually healing mage take one game scale multiplayer harder game mounts form pets boats hang gliders however every new area must go find purpose giving player faster travel speed speed dull movement time removing every time progress every two hours infuriatingthe goodon positive game receiving bugfixes content updates changes skills ie quicksand scout part better old skills old skillsthe dungeons cool feel samey first two three go new biome resets gearoverall found cubeworld good hours enjoyment point began convincing team mate go play alpha progression modding dedicated servers almost game gameplay much better progression though overpowered end scales hard says something hours alpha last week beta shiny new beta dont buy wait hopefully get reworked everything far seems done weeks time get money heartbreaking see little effort seems went doesnt even mention rampant moderator abuse steam forums deleting post dared offer solutions fix multitude fundamental gameplay issues lack acknowledgementcomment anything community brings bug reports good ported old alpha pretty easily leaves bad ugly behind release build compelling reason play disheartening opinion stay away stay far away paid alpha way back today game dumpster fire manyurl thingsurl trashed replaced worse counterparts creator stripped away many good ideas implementations left us good engine best wife seemingly fled launch leaving game vary barebones alpha dev promised us good amount content fled second time first time fled took years supposedly depression caused attack may people buying gameurl anyone points sort negative criticism steam forums mods delete act like assholes character progression sucks really bad grind roughly hours items conquer area within another start gear becomes worthless buy game unless wolley comes back fixes paid game back alpha days loved love sure region lock huge problem lot salty alpha players hit nice drop weapon grind almost immediately alpha monsters still hard kill even really good weapon specifically artifact keepers certain dungeons yes game needs little bit love care little bit less harassment haters wollay pixxie keep updates beta see cube world taking like storm like alpha stages even though next updates back thenif youre new player never played seen cube world would recommend game warned get region lock something take lightly leave region without gear need farm another piece basically beginning tediousthe game great feel crafting shops stuff need bit love flight paths death mechanics difficulty perfect right opinion peacefull exploration game interesting new dynamics gameplay focussed stat maxing incredible world generation lot different structures lore people giving game lot flak personally really enjoy update wollay lot new things love would recommend playing game still going places still super enjoyable play enjoy region lock cant grind good gear level murder every single thing game problem whatsoever super glad update release date came used lot fun playing game used get repetitive old systemtldr people saying game isnt good anymore end opinion mine encourage get game play find great still personal opinion however game used amazing still like style genre love game people mad game years ago good game yes different lot fun play friends people also mad aint easy fun people argue years ago progression system became endless grind ultimately pointless agreetoday progression system goes zonebyzone regionlocked equipment go opposite extrem years ago make even bigger grind restartevery single zone scratch devs done years design progression system across zones created enemies fight dungeons crafting resources drop stronger stronger enemies equipment variety moment theres barely difference power level example blue gear every blue gear strong blue gear introduce power rangesthis game falls flat nose currently reason start new zone get hang gliding diving speed buffs whatever thats worth allwhy didnt create dungeons endgame resources gear diversity skill trees skill points endgame bosses etc etc people liked game features removed alpha seems silly make huge changes get rid existing community people play least region reviewing actually enjoying game im playing like crazy lot building lot things region lock made explore instead going dungeon dungeon like alpha thing didnt like artifacts difficulty first region actually hardnow done regions complete finish get game works regions extremely easy artifacts gives bonuses special items find regionlike glider pet boat atleast found yet artifacts gives bonus like damage bonuses like actual makes want search artifacts find everything game im sure gonna grow boring hope gets lots updates keep playing price combat system liked lot people say alpha better wrongpeople say game improved correctthis game really fun gameplay progressiongear based gameplay actually makes lot sense even though know people hate losing progress every new biome maybe couldve rationalised region based lore fair criticism think overshadowing achievements gamewhat comes fun exploring new biomes fighting difficult bosses game relaxing game beautiful worth every cent personally loved game came still greatly enjoy waiting long seeing planned updates site feels though handed different game hoping upgrade cubeworld instead feels weve traveled one alpha another personally good game like new system dungeons little boring adventure starting go dungeon dungeon get better armor weapons personally loved game despite flaws certainly better come developers person team family personally think people mean year interval big alpha release nowcubeworlds pretty fun leveling mechanic isnt youd expect game harsh learning curve still fun exploring world pretty fun especially find points interest middle nowhere exploring worlds lore pretty fun learning various kingdoms regions various tribes areas enjoyablethe one thing wish extremely rare equipment didnt range limit get theres range limit equipment primary form increasing stats game world goes forever overwhelmingly easy youre constantly walking around like godoverall im happy cubeworld still fun way harsher game alpha personally games issues really lot criticism put upon valid lot points people make make sense though someone never really capable playing alpha able fantasize really game first place im locked older view people game feel like negative comments personally come place wanting old cube world back yeah course old game great likely fantastic though someone never expierenced alpha im happy fun doesnt mater month eternity good time know three hours think glitched last night said six reason stopped playing school personlig dont get hate love changes phenomenally well made game extremely confusing first get thrown information direction new player experience could slightly improved game exploration finding farming loot felt extremely fulfilling unlock first item every single one play game get see deliberateness certain mechanics may questioned firstgame extreme potential hope content added like additional weapon types abilities classes etc played hours enjoyed say like slower paced games distant end goal dont like reaching endgame quickly fun drains game move something else spending hours looking legendary magic wand damage current legendary magic wand isnt fun enjoy dropping power ladder new area finding loot climb back boat hang glider leash problem could definitely fix game sorely needs bit content spice things region locking big deal needs lorestoryexplanation maybe game mechanic used bypass region locking youve done enough work really dont like itwas game ready full release though maybe maybe played couple hours beta game absolute wash might played alpha way back honestly idea gutted muchno xp skill progression system possible level infinitely may seem repetitive interesting see far could take character wasnt perfect system made everything trivial gear system great much like actual arpg would play two things could probably addressed make progression little challenging creating difficult content would one beta stripping us gear clearly fun way things skill tree system removed could specialize things like hang gliding making go faster also true boats etc similar artifacts work currently beta butbetter actual choice also skill improvements made character feel bit stronger situationsi dont know game longer fun game isnt something id normally play begin im huge fan arpgs beta longer something id consider rip alphaim probably bias honestly really enjoyed alpha much hits heavy feel probably overly passionate drastic change bottom line played alpha probably going enjoy beta played back alpha years kinda excited see finally see full release find things enjoyed removed game seen little progress years mind boggling played alpha enjoyed skill progression system feeling working towards making powerful game state feels overly grindy rewarding region locking fine ways lack skill progression real turn plan playing bit time dont think worth hopefully wollay starts actually communicating us played alpha received beta version free steam game fantastic premise beautiful aesthetic current state cannot recommend basic mobility tools regionlocked long term progression game hours gameplay making small boosts stats like boating speed acquired made feel like id achieved nothing game feels emptier barebones alpha many teased features scrapped six years development community feedback addressed developer expect additional changes game future cube world beta nostalgic fun hours especially friends believe worth full price tag played hours full different regions got super unmotivated bored try progress artefacts daily patches none recently seems like nothing changed added almost coins buying anything seems pointlesssure could odd buildings content havent used progression isnt best pick theres big update played alpha little loved bought despite reddit steam said honestly really bummed current state game appeared online thought id play bit someone modded game made like alphawell dollars spent game already racked hours days playing thats pretty unusual actually really enjoying find even remotely bothered region lock system solid hours per region multiplayer works extremely well google get friends join game probably absolutely think game worth dollars cube world worth wait give shot played alpha excited final product wanna go back played ago shitty laptop im grown enough play nasa pc still lovin voxel game genre definitely check game worth first hrs played alphawhile many features reworked core gameplay still exploration fighting still feels awesome ton fun adventuring beautiful world voxelswhile many find regionlocking feature annoying unneccessary solves fundamental problem overpowered one point however solves problem created another nothing accomplish region impact power character always progression within region overall point view almost progression thing makes character powerful long run artifacts hidden dangerous places dungeons mostly movement upgrades sometimes dont feel like worth trouble right thing give journey meaningthat said game still blast sure regionlocking bit controversial issue enough reason give game downvoteit still fun ever played hours really give good try dont buy dont level gameplay super simple worst worst get good equipment area go another area equipment loses stats entirely star legendary axe went next area less starter weapon progression thats resetting progress tiny ass area mention way finding village takes way long die much start looks great great potential ya flubbed worth buy played alpha long time ago seriously cant recommend game current state gear regionlocked theres literally real sense progression pretty messy overall xp leveling completely removed left alpha version released six years ago significantly better opiniondev also gone completely silent twitter since release im sure even get updates improve fix hope dont feel like willi buy alpha long time ago get steam copy free nice played alpha nearly decade ago miss exp think artifacts little significant im love new version good game played beta bit guess expert looking old cube world sure hell aint fun anyways dont know refreshing play game overall great fun friends means go buy played alfa quite bit extensively going felt like return nice warm bed didnt yet play much still really fun get feeling back interface feels still bit wonky get used ok nice see game finally finished although wolly probably keep tweaking played alpha loved game playing beta still loving game explore really huge world find quests get better craft really lovely made game much details und always something new explore recommend cube world played alpha ages ran multiple servers years everything loved gone place game loop isnt rewarding region locked gear makes leaving home zone tedious chore losing ability use mount boat glider entering new zone ridiculous clear ocean zone go neighboring one refind boat stuck swimming every want see cube world could look wollays youtube channel watch videos years ago played alpha many years ago full release really expands gameplay provides great co op experience play friends played alpha religiously loved skills progression dev went awol yearscomes back promising changes releases beta okay actual release doesnt like backlash critique changes werent good alpha gameplay goes awol day still hasnt updated communitynot surprised dissapointedif want play play mods played alpha came quite interested see would years ago steam somehow even less playable played alpha much better felt empty anything like played also practically unplayable unless friends definitely worth played game official release loads fun reliving alpha build could use game mechanics like exploring starts getting repetitive im still hopeful game played game hours fun playing friends leveling means nothing progression game artifacts minimal point themthings believe game look giving us road map theyre going look things game going everyone gets idea going happening well keeping touch people played game back alpha loved game love played alpha know certainly similar experience many core combat mechanics without traditional rpg skill tree xp system game focused exploration enjoy games like breath wild youll love cube world lot game world dense challenges quests areas explore progression definitely seems slow first feels great working regions conquering challenges couldnt earlier gameoverall game feels like mix rpg exploration game learning ins outs area youve done everything interests youll get mileage game looking forward whats come played game see progress region lock would ok artefacts would give buffs life skill boosts mean game fun short time friends dont catch rly lags end game content updates hope atm seems like wollay disappeared wouldnt recommend played game minutes spent hanging village spawn next talking towns folks dialogue plain short one gave quest save gnome way side mapi spent minutes time traveling across barren landnot much terms things dojust lot walkingthere higher levels mobs along way avoid themseems like mobs circumference travel travel groupsnot creative setupi met knight requesting help fighting higher level mob decided help himi ended using hit run tactic eventually got restart progress save gnomethats

bit criticismhonestly good game even besides changes regional system doesnt bother much allows every part world feel like new adventure without make characters game feels bit unfinished though parts found ending wetlands biome second zone one characters zone dungeons didnt work mobs would broken ai attacking running past huge curves instead right towards attacking world would simply simply stop rendering within areagood game could little bit work never know maybe update one dayid still recommend pre good pretty awesome game spend hours enjoying wollay definitely big plans grow game pretty bare bones still even years development even basic skill tree type char progression beyond swim speed lantern light radius would feel like breath fresh air pretty stale unrewarding currently pretty boring hope somehow play alpha purchasemodding support would nice pretty fun took probably fun thing game xp skill trees wont keep playing add pretty fun even years fun friends though pretty fun little bit repetition pretty good game tbh takes get promised still fun great mods though pretty much reasoning everyone elsealpha farfrom perfect beta release even game gives sense progression apart

recommendation summaryafter playing alpha week beta certainly recommend game looking pretty looking varied procedural world explore fun combat unique take rpg mechanics long afraid steep initial

warrior mage rogue ranger start abilities unlocked fixed base stats race entirely cosmetic stats modified weapons armor trinkets gear gained quests exploring world killing enemies gear tiers get lucky skyrocket top tier power levels unlucky beginning struggle even weakest enemiesyou also find magical items help get unreachable areas items help navigation like boat hang glider items get including gear usable region find gear remains inventory useless outside region exception gear name taken adjacent regions without losing statsthere though artifacts legendary tier items give permanent ability

consumables crafting materials got areas well lot easier get basic gear towns start new area may found lore guide towards areas artifactsi enjoyed continue enjoy loop since exploration far hasnt stopped feeling satisfying since every area something new find akin entering new stage enter different region instead continuation larger worldthis divisive topic shown reviews time since also doesnt permit infinite leveling progression based grinding enemies better gear due combat gear exploration aiding items remain relevant leave zone though also started debate said rpgs entering new area leaves powerless compared local creatures numbers high higher different digressthe procedurally generated world superb plenty variety interested exploring finding new locales finding whats next hill

like capital cities unsure maybe wait sale keep game wishlist keep eye future updates rip alpha fun rather pirate alpha much better fun read reviews recommended unnecessary repeat contructive criticism want agreei really hope devs announce kind roadmap listen community read reviews agree getting game yet unless changes ofc read reviewsin essence game decided strip fun rpgs midgame dole end game tiny slivers replace fun even early game grind powerlessness isnt even rpg anymore game rpg mechanics proof concept totally works game isnt worth ten dollars let alone twenty free games provide people clearly wanted cube world initially seemed offering theres point playing game unless enjoy idea playing mmorpg deleting character every time reach level five starting new one exact class race im blunt im cruel vendetta personal stake game besides twenty dollars drain unless gets pretty drastic facelift things people enjoyed alpha brought back going small feat programming prowess restructure game much theres genuinely way game worth playing pretty much anybodyedit new information sat game looked peoples opinions realized offer people trying analyze game thats released separate context alpha development time many games cases perfectly reasonable cube world opinionindie games built community support since cant depend publisher large team paid top dollar need support community behind cube world support spades people playing game vocal things liked didnt like setting aside people started defending game concept developed vacuum bad idea understandable given conditions faced dev terms immense online harassment ridicule softer point still contact discord server full people supported religiously one im sure would glad dig game provide feedback barring never let anyone else play fear leaks theres ground stand search cube world alpha yt one years flooded people playing alpha playing multiplayer people loved game know fact played hundreds hours know one youtuber literally still using cube world alpha footage talk earlier year release announced access feedback access seeing people enjoyed maybe thats game wanted make anymore case thats fine dont call cube world dont try use infamous title controversy create buzz hype release make different game dev said scrap restart scratch times didnt wouldnt even loss work case use assets cube world whatever cube world already made distributed widely adoring fan base isnt anyone youtube account could tell five minutes less im going give slack excuses game unfinished poorly put together im glad people able fun one glance ratings shows thats universal fun game game fun certain type person certain people fun peeling potatoes releasing game feels dishonest utmost reeling people already idea game like yearning familiar gameplay mechanics sweet sweet endless arcadelike progression fun chill multiplayer granted broken mobility mechanics tied whole experience together thats people knew thats cube world market thats said delivering stripped things people expecting wanting whole reason game smash hit alpha stages became practically household name presented game product consumer base genre everything im appalled dont believe happened maliciousness takes intense negligence get bad behave way ive heard removing perfectly honest criticism taking blog refuse pretend acceptable behavior really enjoying game quite bit different originally released alpha version polish gameplay loop much improvedmany people probably enjoy region locked gear approach game roguelite action adventure game makes lot sense really cant recommend game current state regionlocked gear progression really takes away original alphas exploration infinite progression theres virtually incentive explore regions one character rolling new characterif changes undone core gameplay loop isnt selfcontained tiny sections map ill gladly change review really dont like direction game went semblance fun removed seemingly reason try different really enjoyed game launch hope features added different game play optionsedit well came back praying something new nope dont waste money really enjoying game worth every penny long updates im grateful see game completed look forward future updates really enjoying new updates makes exploring area feel fresh interesting exploring loot new area fun well makes clearing areas feel rewarding riding sailing hang gliding still really fun well really enjoying masterpiece anyone giving bad review hasnt researched game meant played mates great time great time game really fun could explaining everything really fun game constantly getting updated great friends really good adding mods discord good mod list really good game great graphics although good alpha really good game really fun playing friends open worldanimalsweapons much morebut think price big game really great game spent lot time playing plan spend lot playing coop def way go love region locking honestly great try really high hopes overall dissapointment beta player tried give game fair motivated shot times time would lead less less motivation continue forward also lorestory linenpcs complete joke actual writing made children linear traditional rpg experience cube world could amazing though developer decided wasnt good enough replaced something worse really feels uninspiring play really love played alpha problem alpha world leveled infinitely basically meant always level release fixes issue splitting map regions creates satisfying gameplay loop eventually break little skill strategy people complain region locking dont understand play gamethere classes styles class types weapons different attacks making grand total different play styles mention tweaks make build various statsthe move sets huge making strategies employ defeat enemies large get incredibly skillful way fight way move around landscape way strategically plan journey area area locking brilliant way creating gameplay loop ultimate goal break loop aquiring items work across regions artifacts weaponsarmor end name progression system leave feeling like god become fast powerful feeling able start region quickly progress star gear compounds feeling powerabsolutely brilliant game would love see updates future perhaps ones create economies property game looking forward many playthroughs really lovely game thanks wollay cool really nice game currently unplayble due lowest fps ive ever seenplease devs work performance really nice gamesome flaws system searching better gear much replayabilitythe fact xp gives game unique progress route really really really sad say loved alpha purchased bought hype defended game beta first came dont mind game mechanic changes know fun combat either die instantly die instantly nothing essentially challenging suddenly impossible mostly changes direction wollay moved support quite right would love developer active communication fans progressing game improvements withheld opinion looks obvious wollay going make famous disappearing act dont expect much point fun dont want get personal understand wollay said depressions etc cannot change supported strongly even many years every opportunity make amends community completely failed take advantage fact hes downright done wrong things hard sympathize someone cannot communicate whatsoever hope case even deepest depression right simply excuse self destructive behavior well self destruct away id love help cant even communicate rapport positive feelings wollay leading release im sick sorry game fun real sad im sad thanks wollay heck recommending playing straight hours progressed much better first hours game tried beta love cant wait play even rest week thanks wollay refunded completely different thought would considering last years fun play super frustrating get oneshot everything time regardless changes made throughout development game still graphics feel original cube world back hope developer changes back development cycle rather continuing develop one region lock improves replayability game immensely making possible keep playing game many hours initial region completed region lock much fun blue screen death actually would rather bsod pulls ram computer region lock bad game doesnt allow explore like alpha region lock kinda bummer specific mods remove best game ever still best game ever tbh region lock big brain move region locked gear punishing exploration real progression system lot announced features got cut development also dev clearly lacks basic communication skillsfeatures announced never made game housing advanced skill trees classes pet evolution certain bossmonsters vanity items spirit cubes pvpnot worth time region locked gear old exp skill leveling system removed unfriendly ux recommend playing beta especially think like alpha different game region locked gear artfacts skills basically neccessity traverse massive world original version would better release steam since least entertaining ride around pet levels effort get bent wolget bent glad didnt pay twice hope helps others pay ever region locked gearregion locked hang glider boat reinsno skill tree abilitiesregion locked fun beating one region feels like youve beaten whole game artifacts give speed light radius region locked items wouldnt recommend till skill trees real progression sort experience added game region locked items kind pain think remove would improve game overall friend fun game region locking really alpha better region locking spicy topic without region locking going eventually permanently level enemies region locking technically always something new zonei dont like removal would consider core mechanics sure take away stats new zone please dont take away boat half way along sea adventures please dont rip glider mid air travelling new zone mind core mechanics get forever wollay developer remove whole bunch locations would reason exist brings problem would say make non artifact adventure locations find glider boat higher level versions one previous glider boat costing less mana faster whatever stat improved endif region locking removed think emphasis enemies scaled go harder enemies excludes flying friends would start difficulty wherever system would entirely player side wherever started gear would scale infinitely alongside new difficulties system would probably work well leveling system go higher level would probably ditch star system unless instead used new glider system highlighted last paragraphdisregarding region locking entirely wish least form horizontal progression small non combat based stat improvements every time level removed game much larger bonuses artifacts stands artifact equipment carry zone zone bonuses small mean absolutely nothing cant feel progression might well therewollay recently went dark social media deleted reviews suggested excluding blog hope continues progress game wish best luck future keeping review recommend think steam reviewers harsh games even reactions justified eyesupdated steam nomination region locking terrible understand exists progression based around acquiring artifacts garbage game rewarding invest lot time think people wait buying alter review changed region thing fun remove region locked gear add levels add attacksskillsadd dungeonsquestsstories progressionthe game fun alpha remove region locked crap good game yeah remove dynamic make equipment useless replace less effective equipent lvl equipment remove region locked gear items maybe add linear questing system rpg elements proper server system game would great alpha way better imo removed skill treeremoved level systemwhy really liked game dont feeling anymoreremove remove going great removed things made game rewarding fun replaced boring walk around world game feel like playing dark souls steroids every time leave biome loot locked biome overall alpha much better game game became unrewarding play get satisfaction removing many mechanics replacing ones punish exploration kind fun really puts game much worse state years agothis games full release referenced monkeys paw years come reviewing games based upon prerelease versions ridiculous lot reviewers read come across emotional childish wont make game review based upon working model game release objectively incoherenti heard game day ago big fan minecraft missed generation games bought game kids experiment far great love graphics love music awesome job developerspostives graphics style musicnegatives cant hit escape exit game ui againwhy many reviewers game sound emotional child like feel sorry developers seem getting game rated series immature exlovers somehow feel emotionally slighted previous version game havent played game solid childlike emotional let would recommend game probably shouldnt listen people playing working builds game pre release seem kind whiny tbh right recommend alpha player free roaming progression levels talents skills etc loved old game gone region lock really really bad leveling gone talent treehope stuff gets readded back game wouldve stayed principle upgraded world quests items etci really wish wollay see reviews game consider changing back better state beforelove game right worth money sadly right worth moneythe alpha enjoyable right game fun regions game loses charm nice game around hours id say worth costs momentthe game showed much promise years ago alpha light content rough funthen came years silence last year teasing screenshots info new featuresthen beta came along allot changed better one problem progressionthe core gameplay fun game starts difficult get gear learn meganics gets betterafter short start quests conquering region problems start soon afterwhen leave region gear gets downgraded start like started first time form progression regions called artifacts find increase non combat abillities small amountthe developer stayed quiet concerns players likely wont anything adress issue right would recommend holding buying game current state least one two things occur improved progression system doesnt feel like creating new character move new region right equipment retains qualities region found andor modding community something improve note played alpha since steam even though steam mentions played less hour played alpha beta roguelite rpg missing lot features alpha im confident still added back ruined gamewas one favorite games developer legit broke everything made funremoved fighting xp removed currency systemno extra alpha buyers believed himremoved combat systemgame quest simulator nowrip good game least still alpha game maybe mod new stuff without crappy changes happyso back day bought game suddenly wasnt available everyone anymore everyone thought game deadi still hoped would come eventually day didzero money wasted glad could see pictures wolfram posting game twitter moment knew hasnt given upbut questionwhen would finish long years hoping often looking launcher updated nota days ago someone told could get steam key game like immediatly went site saw keyhappy times big big thank giving gameedit im honestly shocked people write negative reviews definitely people havent experienced depressioni mean big dreams developers want make game notice cant implement everything want agree level skill work something outwolfram dont listen negative people dont deserve long game makes happyi allowing comments people say opinion comment please adult dont negativity spreader people likely see remember negative experiences positive ones sad turned like thisloved alpha sad story great game l sad remember alpha much fun remember wollay ghosted everyone people would host alpha servers play much fun completely rekt skip let die like years ago wollay hope choke dry biscuit sadly completely different game alpha hope like region locked loot sadly years waiting received grade please dont throw game away update back supposed updates promised sadly gonna agree rest community alpha key initial release loved version game bits current version lacks lots made original cube world popular many blatant issues build game either addressed publicly changed rip cube world sadly seems like another mans sky case alot hype alot let game feels like gone backwards losing level system favor region system uses hopeful silence devs makes feel like really cant even say game might become good current state lacking reason play wish could recommend game sadly game supported alpha things subject change sure roadmap completely changed regionlocked gear punishment exploring enemies unable kill without gear get gear kill enemies get lucky vault drop die lot everything walking back takes minutes plus arent constantly farming respawn points also takes tons wandering skills gone class sort stand damage rogue others worth trying play solo without gearin hours managed one piece nice gear gets disabled soon cross arbitrary boundary still level artifacts desire play game dont care levelling item based xp based resetting progress every region kind removes point exploration adventure game turns grinding exact things per region sadly average average game could really great quests boring add story lore behind world tasks oftentimes reward enough effort wish could recommend game sadly cant especially dev going silent best wishes guy hope try sell another game many others give chance due quite frankly awfulnonexistent community interactions sadly cannot recommend game current state punch face regional equipment great incentive exploration game focused exploration sadly beta deviated far away original premise game alpha really fun opinionif youre zeldalike get item move ahead repeat might exploration wont get much itthe game punishes exploring really loved alpha want proceed new biom lose items levels lack progression makes game fun everything earn every monster defeat means nothing grand scheme things everything resets go new biomit sucks giving game thumbs especially since ive following loving years many bad game design choices made made getting game worth opinion sadly game disappointing wanted like theres lot promise year radio silence theres reason buy game would suggest buying unless new update comes unlikely reviews update good sadly great tiny little game made massive design shift become game thats fun play reviews likely catalog issues detail mine upshot fun play due intense difficulty extremely limited read almost progression mechanics take progress made render uselessif changes ill change review issues everyone else progression fun rpg elements removed gameit needs serious updates could recommend save money maybe another years big publisher might bought turned something good playablepretty disappointed point save money move maybe real update come dont believe screenshots promise anything save moneythe game updated think beyou get bored least hoursthere nothing interesting past point trulydo buy game support developer seeing game hitting steam made really excited long since alphato keep short game needs work lot starts fine exploring spawnregion completing first quests fun gameplay gets stale quickly fact every region resets almost hardearned equipment upon entering help feeling least players alpha didnt pay steamversion theres seems fun theory fun friends seeing dev posting disappeared yet probably wise investment bought way back original release ive constantly disappointed seems like game abandoned like six years ago alpha release game also less fun play compared alpha version due extensive gameplay changes contains plenty bugs setting aside comparisons alpha cannot recommend game especially current price comes single question whats pointgear region locked equipment going one region ships needed explore ocean biomes means travel locked regions well game exploration penalizes exploring thats okay since map uncovered completely anyway tell landmarks get items minutes studying mystery whats next hill already knowartifacts help move faster increase light radius bonus combat fighting enemies pointless unless want gear becomes useless next region crafting recipes region locked well time get already better gear upgrading weapons pointless since weapons region lockedthe equipment issue could solved making kingdom based instead region based nothing drives player explore kingdoms time youve obtained artifacts tools single region youve seen entire gameplay loopthe game also riddled bugs release makes obtaining gear items impossible doors blocked terrain impossible get binding climb hangglider single button default makes scaling certain places troublesomei really wanted like game see released state disappointment shallow gameplay unfufiling grindprogression rolls back every hours terrible difficulty manage remove make combat even skillless alphas rng dictate much fun havesalvageable progression rework heavy balancing needed cant recommend writing review shit game better back day short sweet review good game different alpha necessarily bad way going game need treat like completely different game short sweet game fun aesthetically pleasing worth price tag though feel could get hours wanting play longerim confident developers improve game given time inputcons artifacts useless need reward player crafting weapon designing become useless shame one fun things alpha spirits removed well big needs combat balances quests repetitive interesting mobs drop amount gold besides bosses material limits quite low enough crafting recipes dungeons quite easy parkour typically super simple puzzles anything combat dungeons dont many secrets loot get sometimes get artifacts one region another amount work effort water mage ability r useless lolpros artifact leveling system unique fresh region locking specifics items enhancing replayability multiplayer easy extremely fun combat fun skill based aesthetic beauitfulideas future pet features leveling system skills better skills passive skills ability change hairstyles cosmetics hats wing particles emotes depth classes racesim missing lot things feel said others communitylove short answer worth price little content much left outgot game back alpha didnt amount content feel like progressing account however seems passion wollay pixxie back may lost made version way done iti hope wrong isnt end dont much hope considering entire beta last week one time acknowledged community feedback current core system gameonly small changes like skill tree skill points artifacts varying new abilities change play class scaling regions based type amount artifacts achieve would make much better game short answer game alright beginning pretty hard especially play solo enemies lot stronger progression pretty quick pace lucky enough find high star weapons armor pretty refreshing get new area spending hours one kinda demotivating cant keep inventory collect new weapons armor fair theme really fun start got really repeadative friends game definitly easier mor fun short storyme three friends enjoying game much flaws sure overshadowed depth complexity im reminded procedural odd generation happenslong storyive followed cube world since remember alpha release great exploration intense initial difficulty eventually turned hunt reported map seeds became overpowered everything else followed wolframs development since via tweets community discord excited primarily determination test different styles gameplay something provided satisfaction surprised removed xp even persisted release today im glad became case love gear longer levellocked every drop discovery enjoyed immediately love doesnt take absurd amounts time find high rarity gear becomes obsolete levels love increased density meaningful locations well things find places love game continues provide great challenge fully exploring several regions agree however artifacts provide stronger bonuses possibly configurable augmentation classs skills currently mobility improvements felt hours playingfeedback provide beginners guide explaining combat mechanics ie dodging direct blows recovers mp remove reigns make pet riding default ability compliment every town basic roaming pets dogscatsbunnies appropriate pet food sale let every region hold minimum artifacts unless region especially small let increases artifacts three times greater change augment class skills configurable ways quest window filtered region ordered difficulty lore window filtered kingdomregion ordered chronologically positional sound stereo speakers please shortly game went live wrote negative review state game also knowing history developer disappearing acts never know even game ever get update deleted hoped could proven wrong wait see approachgame released september december outcry wondering developer long enough reply literally anyone literally anything twitter updates nothing silent years could silent years time knows cant recommend game developer completely ignoring playerbase years end right release steam seems like cashed took ball went home thankfully since bought game alpha many years ago got free steam least fun alpha modders turning game around though refuse recommend game developer released early access removing rpg elements making easy get items removing items time pass another area plain dumb dev needs listen people make fixes game love look feel game much potential wasted work bringing back features players liked alpha version sick game especially friends bit grindy though since game region locked make sense end since get powerful enough literately one shot things within given region unless golden boss mob key items get annoying collect region however likely find quests also gives game extra layer difficulty aside though wish zones bigger would less hassle reclaim key items dont mind getting like zones within map go repeatedly grabbing key items get boring quick wish zones bigger maybe like aside aspect though really love multiplayer fact keep items friends worlds honestly awesome instead starting like different save files definitely keep playing game lots things explore cant wait next update similar opinion others rerelease isnt good alpha youre looking improved game isnt however despite mistakes think developer made game still maintains lot potential update game reasonable rate regard communitys feedback game still become worthwhile play simply worth sad say many people high hopes game sadly deliver completely ruined would amazing game simply put cube world beta nothing cube world alpha promised complete rework thats wont recommend since redeemed code reciveing beta able play game pc

someone put tons time alpha played little bit quit went played alpha perhaps updates add much needed direct progression system game updates fill lot gaps gameplay loop game lot fun given devs past might another years neverhonestly feel like alpha finished game release although release flashy new environments removed core parts made game fun constant nonreset progression meaningful least ive played hours never alpha overall ive enjoyed game lot honestly feel like people chill game beta wollay pixxie updating lot ive seen prefer game compared alpha thing dont feel like crafting worth relics little better reward like alpha aesthetic stripped dumbd limiting objectiveless lose boat sailing wood doesnt work across invisible borders arent updates since wollay disappeared second grabthemoneyandgo scheme probably whine mental heath later bsoh way less pets ability pet animals doesnt even matter lets start saying ive never played game sorta naive fans alpha version six years ago expect exact game see comparison thief joy say game starts choose race effect gameplay class went warrior berserker specialization start village tutorial venture world get obliterated mobs rinse repeat started expeditions cautiously read guide two community hub suddenly coming together getting newbie gear taking enemies par finally got first loot allowed power really hit ground running looting slashing combat smooth fun youre playing getting rekt exploring region feels little tedious tastefully littered monsters around wont feel dull ive played hours one dayfor team wollay wife game fun right respect choice try new progression style im talking region lock needing collect artifacts collecting artifacts get stronger awesome idea needs feel rewarding understand region lock reward completing region makes feel like wasted time nothing wollay youre reading please please dont stop working game dont try burden two project big give community chance interact game goes long way community inputs reactions attitude veteran players bit sad truth say still excuse brazen fun game look forward updates game fun start new world adjacent world dev using mental health main reason interact community course important seems fishy even single try say something point believe steam responsibility hold developers responsible first making sure plan first week launch least seems like dream happen almost two weeks dev dipped lost light lies ahead purchase hopeful soul withered sack fleshi understand anger dissapointment cant spellgame fun first hours ill give feels generous many many years ago buddy mine said cube world coming today game watched little excited play spammed refresh button picroma website trying get hold game day one despite website issues good incomplete waited obviously talented design team people put shine instead died simply fell dead many years passedthe buddy reaches tell cube world released steam overhaul game feature complete dive ininstead found dragged beaten desiccated corpse old cube world stripped best parts implementing new bad game mechanics assume picroma needed money minimum work necessary different sold steam get new revenue long term investor evangelist hopeful player game great confidence say literally noone ever pay game packaged sold disappointment many things wrong game marketed exploration rpg heres punished exploring lose gear change area find low level mobs refarm gear every time decide move mile radius includes mounts transport decided keep playing even lose gear explore ok way level find artifact zone bonus give lamp radius boat movement speed boat lose change zone youre forced change zones bonus never help combat effective time since find boatglidermount againonce youve done zone youve done theres point playing one zone took years update alpha better hopefully itll good another years much lost potential game really shame game still looks amazing years ago gameplay fun probably get dozen hours youve done youve beaten least one zone fun quickly wears youre back old grind sad changed best part game developer released alpha years ago allot fun dont hear anything long time sudden come back releasing steam game joke fun compared alpha version developer disappears cool dont waste money game means perfect early grind equipment frustrating since everything hard till get gear even hard tell handle region locked gear means itll something go multiple times honestly fun loop build game around apparently artifacts total level havent found makes hit little harder quite bit departure alpha lot issues seem building entire game vacuum instead feedback along way worth game fun moments work lot fun multiplayer figuring game friend trying get pets blast overall combat fun youre adequately prepared something difficult little adventure stumble certain charm may game want today im interested seeing goes future sounds interesting give shot keep youre eye least game would better original piece first game good lacking something newand exciting way back ups downs gamefirst would like start upsthe game design especially items integrate really cool like harp open doors flute set spawn points travels points even going onto sky island progression one region seemed right giving nice challenge start think terrible really talk villagers npcs youll discover key locations quickly able get whole region done spawned approximately hours overall beauty game brings back alpha makes cube world stand outdownsidesregion locked gear fan wish level locked instead artifact based leveling system seemed like good idea go another region small benefits gear feel like game could benefit wanted keep system items drop often even allow player add modifier cost gold item needs found game controls hidden away without even telling player shown tip player initiallysuggestions developerbring back original leveling systembring back skill treeshave option disable region lock gear possible remove feature allgive player short tutorial start friends couldnt understand play told press buttonlower chances pet food drops high honest already pet food two regionsallow option change scroll controls ex map camera zoomallow modifiers bought village feature stayingoverall like combat would like see change game start review game amazing quests biomes landscapes beautifulthe combat entertaining fun mainly exploration rpgif like powerscaling tons combat abilities game explorationregional locking helps exploring entire zone running big straight line biomes like alfa feel like every biome new adventure full msteries wonders like gigantic flatlands diferent colors blasted every biome forgettableas enjoying game couple hundred hourseditstill opinion update bit mods enjoying enjoy still cant recommend game asis said thankfully hope wollay believe still working gamea recent teaser proven based image looks like itll address issues thatre present gameto even surprise hype wollay decide stick guns work game honestly im gratefuleven communication isnt end pulling around fixing issues ill flipping review soon possible desperately look forward improvementsthank tons wollay first heard game released steam extremely excited long time fan waiting update since game released alpha bought game alpha many hours release beta still excited see updates wollay couldnt wait try beta downloaded beta realized things changed removal leveling system skill system little disappointed still optimistic adventured throughout first region doubts quickly proven wrong rarity weapons equipment still provided feeling progression however soon figured region lock equipment fatal flaw beta release makes progression within game feel pointless thing really matters getting artifacts ive heard add minor stat boosts things like glider speed boat speed things dont matter either use boats gliders within region found wanted fully take advantage stat boosts would find equipment every time enter new region opinion repetitive pointless hope wollay realizes fatal flaws within new version see cries community bringing back leveling skill systems removing region lock would make game times better playing alpha think better also think gliders boats reigns purchasable usable everyone like alpha solve region lock problem separate region could increase difficulty based biome forest regions easy tundra regions medium lava regions hard example read wollay thank youve done please fix flaws make things like change review positive wollay manages address issues fix games current state dont recommend however problems addressed opinion may change tldr new version removes lot made original great good additions however removal leveling skill systems added region lock make progression pointless bringing back leveling skill systems removing region lock would immediately fix lot betas problems games current state dont recommend start years change gameplaymap revealed leveling region locked gear makes game alpha spent countless months playing saying blast playing last day good potential get better go places yes played years ago yes looking forward building house extra goodies gonna get still cube world art music exploring loved came gotta smart things wolly would one thing would bring house making something wanted bad good game look forward sinking hours months untill get bored new content im hoping new content features let add one major thing wolly gave game alpha players didnt care would made us pay keep leaving negative comments leave cube world never work please kill game absolutely still recommend game despite interesting changes happened since alpha back npcs somewhat useful skip nights artifacts lore scavenger hunting fast travelthings im uncertain include removal level removal skill trees removal quests biomelocking gear seeming removal world selectionall still super rough means finished product im still optimistic could certain things tweaked slightly things reimplementedhonestly really like skill trees dig whole biome specific loot system id like something kind like option choose systems world creation least bought game alpha usd got one free simple fun progressed saved character items skills levels character could take different worlds lose progress similar terraria world entire randomly generated infinit world much like minecraft still borders wouldnt reset progress every time crossed themi highly recommend watching youtube videos people playing alpha favorite person watch ethoslabeven though alpha infinite level grind real goal still manageable game years later gigantic step backwards maybe people havent played alpha dont feel way however even alphas fewer skills content still outweighs additions game simply border system recommend game need work balance content developers deserve attention trying something new even particular loved public something need new ways playing games agree lot things said cube world progression feeling moment particularly strong artifacts levels need reviewing additions gear system stand good innovative forces players work rewards items used exploration problem tho would better instead loosing hand glider boat reins things like reduced effectiveness gathering would giving small increases speed stamina etc short unique game focused making players explore world bad good points like games people complaining mostly ones addicted level grinding alpha version witch years old lot things still progress game early access devs want people try creation get feedbacks help make game better wish mixed option game definitely dont flat recommend game dont outright condemn either guess ill go recommending virtue devs silent ill explain whats good bad gamefirst game needs proper fucking tutorial nothing explained nothing youre dropped world right next monsters probably cant kill expected figure since people expecting combat game first thing theyd try fight enemies get frustrated easy die real penalty dying respawn nearest respawn point youve unlocked dont know find respawn points end way back place started one important aspects game learning look map find respawn points also fast travel points important points interest lore reveal location artifacts town purchase upgrades crafting materials never taught
