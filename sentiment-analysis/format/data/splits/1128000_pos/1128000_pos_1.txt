good idea trying different instead sticking leveling progression fighting difficult gathering gear exploring slow good play game difficulty still think sort progression outside gear essential keeping people engaged overall goal maybe really neat map another region lot crafting supplies idk artifacts help get good amount plus crafting books gathering resources playing game always useful starting new zone think easy times would maybe like every mob turn yellow difficulty getting max stars weapons gear zone ability murder npcs game fresh canvas many possibilities future updates get lot different things maybe use invest realm enjoy made dude enjoys plus every person got game free past purchase didnt recommend upset want rape level come back alpha rape sheep dogs wollays wife wollay aint cuck aint gonna let incel gearhaters rape wife bought game years ago alpha one fun games ive played beta version game almost different due reworking core systems see developers tried introduce brand new play style game new play style causes game feel limited people fine playing first hours maybe completing zone filled quests game progress basically set unless find specific gear used adjacent zones finding specific gear definitely provide motivation play little bit longer motivation wears quickly zone zone youre forced reset almost entirelythe previous skill tree exp system removed entirely rare artifacts provide permanent stat changes character however minimal almost unnoticeable change form movement speeds matter long play character improved form letting travel little bit fasteri somewhat enjoyed game first hours immediately lost almost interest grind grind find least piece specific gear gaining nothing meantime little bits gold moving next zone would make previous game play feel uselessthe entertainment game short lived rewarding long game play feels extremely limited recommend game current state love game playing nonstop since first got think people insulting game either havent played havent played minutes parroting peoples opinions otherwise disappointed game different alpha havent given fair chance personally didnt like alpha much fun nothing got boring quickly comparatively newer version game chalk full things exploring super fun additionally like region locked items heres adds fun exploring new regions provides new tasks region walk new region knowing exactly need find artifacts key items get better gear tasks take time make feel like accomplished something provide incentive fully exploring new areas items werent region locked new areas game would easy exploring wouldnt fun especially true account nature game point game provide infinite adventure places explore legion locking items makes invested exploring new regions experiencing unique area offer additionally fact game goes forever means didnt lock items would get become powerful game goes pick artifacts provide permanent boosts game would lose challenge region locking items makes sure always challenge even played long time conclusion really love game fun well worth twenty bucks especially see map content getting dont listen negative reviews basically meme culture worst always problem cube world honestly even game something everyone would love matter people would still flooded reviews negative comments since hating cube world popular meme since give game try see like game really fun get used new progression system overall game added bunch new semi unique dungeons really fun friends cube world good game sort technically well built game yes well designed game tried play iteration game couldnt get first run utterly frustrating could find starting town bad rng think undead mage everything wanted kill kill quickly everything tried elf rogue little luck butnot much world overbearing death trap stillin fact without basic equipment upgrades impossible much time start stated first minutes players time game filled certain death im saying games hold hand able accomplish anything great designi suppose sort progression game didnt seem fun failed hook world felt see drudgery getting point point progression clear funi play hours hours alpha back day remember able quite bit new player challenging get going never bogged artificial progression hoops wanted take big ogre get goyoud probably diebut possible couldnt even kill chicken entered world new edition game without feeling threatened one chicken area forget itit instant deathi feel game great technical achievment small team great potential attractive open world even minimalistic voxels attractive endearing game spades game play simply fails basic leveli cannot recommend game though want want try someday dont currently patience deal whatever wollay wants players awesome game tons potential game beforehand came alpha loved playing hoursnow must say things changed alpha dont necessarily agree lack exp leveling system im hoping arent permenantly removing since really made whole class system almost completely customizable could ores placed awesomely huge cave systems well considering need ores make equipment melee class hand new things beta implement pretty awesome adds lot game quest systems fast travel new areas unlocked reworking towns new mobs rework overhauls new existing dungeons id say game alot hits taken im sure since creators put steam im sure get updates improve pre existing features well adding amazing new features game gets unlimited potential cant say much changed since cube world first came years ago yes new content surprising little repetitive real levelling system game least traditional rpg style game like used rather underwhelming equipment mechanic doesnt live hoping game edit abandoned gameafter hours original alpha safe say really love cubeworld ive played hours cubeworld since beta release longer game beforeand okay fact love version cubeworld whole lot beforepeople talk ill regionlock system first confused ingenius system makes game region exciting new really hope see wollay pixxie continuing work release future updates great potential character progressions feels nonexistent artifacts gave decent combat stats would fine dont know haters talking game engaging fun emergent amazing coop rpg takes little time buff beginning payoff wonderful really wanted like game simply cant hardly chance survive long enough get better gear explore world every corner waits overpowered monster kills effort playing game like playing soulslike underleveled sure go one bonefire another shrines get fight choice run want progress game beyond spawn im sure laptops specs whatever game runs smooth smooth time show characters moving smoothly hit continue game wont show backgrounds shows blue screen buttons map visible way fix fixed next patch fun goof multiplayer game lacks depth still lot bugsim updating review abundantly clear without shadow doubt developer doesnt give prefers simple pump dump thank goodbye transaction short dont buy let game fade obscurity like author game great grinding system resets one region another lack variety skills little bit frustratingi know game took lot effort made hope next update one put new mechanics features would improve game lot make enjoyable game still fun play region locked gear wasnt thing would challenge outside first couple hours boats reins etc shouldnt locked good game ive really enjoying game playing solo friends see ppl complaining really bad played alpha years friends enjoyed alpha stopped got bit sad moved month ago found getting beta release hyped maybe slightly remember alpha like remember xp skill tress gliders etc looked beta cube world fresh faceso roll last monday surprised yes nothing like old game learning curve bet ya like lot games hold hand game went controls go son fun play mostly friends really enjoy playing different classes expororing finish region kill bosses hits move feel like new game againsure features want wollay add like artifacts giving permeant stat boosts actual combat stats pets useful gliderboatrains bound get better find community give wollay constructive feedback instead acting like children maybe listen lets honest developing game adult starts acting like entilited prick moaning whinning wanted game sending much hate way would listen would nottldr enjoy game dont fine dont act like speak humanity say game fun adult act like one spoilt brat get way sure dont enjoy game fair enough sorry feel way everyone else toxic crying need get grip game brought years ago played game back first released alpha wasnt perfect game fun everything want say already said many others putting help keep people buying sad really love gamejust read reviews ill recommend game wollay make changes hours playing trying enjoy playing without successi dont know made wollay change game much right end im hopeful get better better release comparing alpha really miss features little thingsi miss talent tree even though wasnt big made big difference wollay removed miss exp systemi miss old villages made much sense comparing beta current one looks like bunch random buildings put wrong locationsi miss old inventory let organize items new one downgrade imoi dont even want talk region lock system bad implemented making hate actual progressionartifacts actually joke supposed main feature game everyone hates change dont even care changing make artifacts actually useful making maybe increase stamina regen maybe increasing resistance stun would game changing progression supposed complete regions thinking artifacts uselesslet talk things saw improved addedthe classes still need tweaks improved comparing alphathe villages alive compared alpha npcs running made game look alivelore happy saw wollay added something lore every region hope improves imagine hear read lot game tyrant king terrified people get hint buried cathedral desert another region go see became undead commanding undead army kill get weapon previously quoted note played lot original alpha years ago really enjoyed didnt play recent prerelease alpha update played hours steam beta ton fun game switching back forth warrior character ranger character archer really love exploration aspects game think critical part whether someone enjoy game read anything game around launch know progression system controversial permanent progression character tiny conveniences collecting artifacts slightly faster gliding speed gear becomes useless travel different regions mapfor fun exploring every nook cranny region making sure find every single artifact hopefully find one two gear items move onto next region little bit power boost experience always enough gear going new region feel strong enough jump fights midlevel enemies enjoy process gearing new region said start best part game giant procedurally generated world collectiblesif dont like idea game collect items sake getting might hold attention long bonuses really miniscule really tied idea constantly driving make character stronger stronger probably frustrating gear system cube world definitely unusual doesnt really change minutetominute gameplay rpgs always enemies around weaker ones stronger none gets way see real goal game exploration old review good game kinda boring harder grind early game nothing like used frankly boring much build thrown aside something new didnt make better im still going leave positive review honor game instead become tldrif youre casual player game might youif like looking rewarding time sink could put tens hundreds hours still feel like something work towards isnt world potential current state really fun hoursplaying friends definitely increases enjoyment game tenfoldcompared alpha missing large amount satisfying progressioni personally categorised cube world grind fest game alpha enemies scaling level areas varying difficulty enjoyable play hours upon hours reach goal set whether certain level boss kill fun grind towardsthe issue come current cube world kind end game pinpoint set eyes work towardsgear region locked exception gear makes region either incredibly repetitive absolute snooze festfor examplei started game water mage generally support player enjoy helping friends play gamesso rogueninja friend ran region spawned fun timealthough towards end region happened across wandwhat ensued friend following around next areas went basically nothing could also get piece gear seeing gear became null area whilst still able kill named mobs easeeven though gotten lucky get piece gear made game less enjoyable multiplayer scenarioadditionally added bonus completing region artifacts underwhelming say least almost everybody pointed artifacts rewarding enough make going new region losing almost gear feel awfulit feels every region new game game mode without impactful bonusescube world still lot charm feels watered compared ye old daysbut alas look forward seeing cube world goes hope heart people coding knowledge come cube world begin modding believe game could really flourish modding community alpha backer honestly dont think wollay knows hes solo dev hope starts involving community fixes mess even probably wont come back biggest downgrade game ive ever seen feels like huge slap face money spent time waited open betadate ive played alpha activated old account steampros looks beautiful like always hasgameplay quick get used toovery smooth old rigmost likely hit updates might quick molding consconsno leveling like used leading feel like grind never really gets easier weighs systems used fun gear almost pointless crafting less useful betting good drop monsters youll unlikely beat real way getting strongergear drops class locked mage gets lucky something drop might even useableno starting area anymore big deal definitely isnt helped pitfallsexploring great points major hassle headache go places get stronger plus gear region locked part gear symbol keep strengthdungeons blast get lucky good gear lead high lvl greens first otherwise suffers problems exploringin id say first played game awesome love cant wait alpha back major chance change improvement theres setbacks importantly made great strides better hope wollay best luck cant recommend game current state happy change recommendation game gets updates deserves feel like game could gotten better wollay co decided open criticism versus staying games like starsector received well due devs listening community even putting mods fans made base game alpha great give looks ive played went path away alpha neither alpha final release game perfect earlier version strong foundation could kind see wollay wanted game go lot players excited see would turn years additional workwollay got good game good playerbase please dont let go waste ignore positive reviews posted beta launched seen current state game effectively reviews alpha different game would recommend game current state since alpha version years ago developer removed majority rpg elements game well adding region locking system equipmenttools pretty much start start game every time change regionon top recent beta people bought game years

youre soloriginal reviewcube world finally releasing today long years week betawhile alpha betafull version releases fundamentally different core fighting mobs finding loot exploring huge map remains im fan new region lock system hours playing youll get used itfor whove never played cube world starting die lot choose opponents carefully likely cheese get better weapons things even white tier kill hits game doesnt hold hand find questobjectives youll either talk npcs randomly find location looking map may daunting first know youre looking helps planning adventures better highly recommend starting mage op class get hang core mechanicsin honesty game still needs lot work optimization technical issues beta really shouldve longer fix know wollay wife working game issues may take time fix im sure wollays stance mods full release alpha version huge mod scene im hoping theyll return add new flavors steam workshop items base game since fighting mobs get really repetitiveoverall issues major changes alpha enjoyed beta hours playing beta solo explored regions fully completed regions surprisingly never found glider though found artifacts region worked way getting gold tier weapon armorsmost negative reviews changes game mainly progress system agree bunch points said earlier youll get used new system future updates hope wollay maybe ease find balance alpha beta least gearweapons wont completely utterly useless crossing new border youve never played alpha wouldnt worry much know difficult starting get repetitiveso youre looking game get hour two day give cube world shot hours game time dont hate game bought alpha years ago absolutely loved itthe beta good think thing help game returning back old leveling systemdont necessarily take progression system take region locked gear make area certain level example one think negatives game lack leveling system region locked gear also quest markers npcs offer quests finding dungeons artifacts insanely hard scrolling map ive done find ive found farand almost hours gameplay havent found npc offers dungeon quests still level im loving iti liked alpha like wellwould like footstep sound lowered though hours clean one zone climbing speed amazing alpha high gypsy trashy mofckin piece utter hellish crap expectationsthis game gifted back somehow feel scammed version betterthis reason cant silent years expect good game ok years development timegood potential nice progression system need develop make actually zelda game like gonna coppy cdn worth dissapointment hours alpha hours release progression exp one quest get legendary weapon zone easy cant really think reason play game also want free items free gnome collect loot quit game reload free items may well game hot garbage anyway trash mess put alpha steam instead ill give free item gnome glitch years arecube world gotten lot locations items lost exp levels decided equipment doesnt work go away zone found inexploring game great locations look lot better remember looking alpha years ago going dungeons weird sites pretty funhowever left feeling hollow fully grasped gear items find exploring areas worked starting really weak point fighting mobs took deaths overcome soon enough found rare item basically unstoppable scenario plays every area game put away cool items fought hard get new ones work anytime want change scenery also applies usable key items found regions game finding boat hang glider anything relating pointless step zone item worse could using switch zonesusable items underwhelming usually working door two zone found allowing better forms transportation like boat despite seeming important like spirit bell weather location name updates used lets walk jail barsoverall game feels worse lot ways years ago alpha whole idea game almost purely horizontal progression isnt bad idea current way handled makes feel like nothing work game permanence pointless since gear work anywhere years less content alpha saved whoevers cracked beta key claimed time yearsi bought hay day hype picroma amazing long wish two devs best hope game someday finished hours good time hours gameplay show slightly brighter lamp thanks month old game created years thanks years ago version better years ago great game still good game feels kinda empty without content still recommend game think would like game better years ago hey guys game make

former selflots changes need happen order make game playable ie region locking exploration tools complete removal skill trees mind boggling lack basic introduction base gameplay mechanics longer fun exploration sandbox enjoyed long agothank making sure everyone purchased back alpha got free im disappointed turned hope project recover years development alpha build released public come back little teased content step back core progression system experience skill trees year old version game progression system interesting fails fully realized feels unrewarding game fun first try exploring starting biome find lose equipment must start scratch barring artifacts found granting levels minor improvements swim speed lamp radius utility stats game great potential years ago even current build feeling much worse potential new system still stands theres really nothing actually clearing first region like new game plus absolutely minor unrewarding bonuses every time cross arbitrary border absolutely ruins desire explore provides real sense progression unless sink hours repetitive quests loot grind years development little positive changeits almost game got downgraded im sure someone pick game new fancy people around devs suddenly metaphorically died huge disappointmenteverything promised wasnt delivereda voxel mans sky years expectations somewhere rpg developed alpha version great innovations release version fell short expectations necessary remove pumping system regionlock added interest game simply disappears please return please optimize game years waiting finally released worth itgreat game years waiting since alpha release playing launch needless say worth go years remove things people liked game handed money develop years remove everything game going nice job wollay years remove features nice one wollay years wait worth years waited years hours fun violent disappointment game split near infinite amount regions region effective weaponsarmor use new region like starting game square one played alpha loved like dont buy completely different frankly much worse game hours cant say dont enjoy game like fun definitely needs work hopefully thatll come everyone stops harassing wollay hours im already bored enjoyment restarting every section map alpha lot potential region locked items removed proper xp system implemented would give another chance moment game let edit looks like wollay left us dont recommend better years ago alpha played us like fiddle alpha better seems like bootlegged pawn store version cube world used play wish could back edit saw new website made shame tell thought going get overwhelmingly positive reviews edit deleted blog post seems like cash grab year catfish developer releases alpha alpha fun still alpha developer goes silent half community start think ran money goes almost silent years teasing features years pass almost teased features get added leveling skill tree removed fun removed dont buy game takes meaningful progressiongame shit thisoh wow unexpectedwhen people saying alpha released six years ago better know done something wrong tale two games best game worst game alpha masterpiece hours playable content skill trees opportunities explore needed alpha reach perfection graphics upgrade ability buy house fast travel thats instead got would think inferior game compared alpha sure game looks great doesnt depth levels gone skill trees gone levels game doesnt tell go levels fan base including original alpha buyer thoroughly insulted price dollars save money kids better deals price beautiful game stuck stubborn questionable creator game much potential like describe short form masterpiece game stuck state wollay would come speak say anything hed add items classes skills overarching progression goal itd superb moment gaining lamp increase hours gameplay okay stale empty lifeless worst since release wollay went posting updating daily saying word vanishing pockets full cash nothing else show iti hope speaks updates supports creation shows love community whos years hasnt ever get stage game amazing big beautiful world barren devoid life activity years ago first bought alphathis ea done badly borderline scam big nope one big yikes bit heads review bit depth kinda long dont time tldr bottom post way reviewcube world first foremost game exploring across large voxel built world smacking things till fall apart voxels looting things get stronger core gameplay cube world explore fight grow stronger like many games simple effective formula keeping players engaged reason cube world decided go progression system would seem home rogue lite beyond several reasons giving sort description get starters lets talk exploration way explore grow stronger might seem normal first dungeons getting gear normal right venture little far suddenly find hard earned loot useless game scales gear base level entering zone gear didnt come meaning endless world explore really isnt endless like bunch tiny self contained worlds haphazardly slapped next little regard convenient border indication making accidental crossing inevitable point exploration leads nicely next point actual fights themselvescube world back old days alpha leveling system growing stronger spending points level ups meant always reason get fight matter even little always got something could use form xp new improved cube world leveling thing past effectiveness combat anything else matter based solely gear found meaning certain rank based gear zero reason go back fight enemies good couple rusty swords swinging god killer star great sword mom another nice place shift pointsi god amongst men im dead nothing quite obnoxious powerful gear mean nothing exactly happens moving new zone gotta start way back fighting low level mobs rusty swords gonna powerful old max rank great sword thing get keep rare pieces called relics items give marginal stat boosts things would fine benefit good minute increase travel stats give pathetic one would get dozens see real noticeable benefit meaning start scratch lot get permanent improvement example time first ever relic awarded magic drumroll please faster pet riding well alright doesnt help combat least helps get around faster use bad realize unlock ability ride pet entered new zone unlock ability ride pet new zone dungeon lets could anywhere zone could complete opposite corner zone could last thing find zone unlucky enough yes even tools need required time explore new zone quite reigns ride mount boat sail water glider name three big ones travelso see gameplay loop getting stronger adventure keeping maybe couple tiny rewards starting new adventure something like rogue lite run die buy upgrade gold kept maybe unlocked new item next run runs take half dozen hours took hours taking time get first relic times may vary ridiculous systems like work best run done quickly move next rapid fire name game kind system tiny rewards run globe trotting adventure paceeither system needs removed favor old fashioned leveling system relics need much powerful justify starting scratch every time go new zone even would still end dozens pages inventory space gear dozens different zones want travel back old zone better still old gear starting scratch againbear mind opinion matter might well think game described exactly want game bought six year ago getting update many review see game little wow game part childhood steam lets let nostalgia rosetinted glasses blind us loved game back know much hurts much recommend buying game want people experience joy felt playing back people cant get version anymore one one know much better lets settle lets give honest feedback accept hope wolly listens tldr progression system slow resets progress

game wife help years first started beta confused specifically region locking equipment first thing arent l locked power level goes making high tier item starter weapon first upset cant go explore forever think alpha run around nothing eventually would make new character start nothing right fun ever cube world actually spend time region finding cool dungeons without skipping like would normally become extremely powerful slaying gold tier enemies easy venture new lands new enemies structures spawn powerful weapons armor reduced able find lot personally like new artifact progression system currently seems little slow better nothing like alpha im already level havent left first region hours game play plan playing hundred lot people already said whats bad game buti say big disappointment progression feels like rubber band going back forth doesnt feel like anything get meaning weight zonelevel system makes sense within rpg world played alpha id say would satisfactory fun playing instead rpgs meant make appreciate become connected character world version game feel useless time since know soon enter new zone gear become obsoletedefinitely years worth development feel like wollay wanted get rid cube world hanging head lot people saying new progression system trash imo lot better old levelling system actually makes challenge going new area instead getting best gear one region stomping ones lot people seem hate beta dont really understand changed since alpha yes also years ofc going change long dont mind changes love game great much replayability say hope theyre going add customization later maybe add ability change character towns something able dye armor would pretty great well im looking forward able follow games progress way color waypoint stars would helpful find place want go lot reviews based nostalgia anything game felt fun alpha betayes know endgame sucked adventure way better game much interact beta looks lot nicer alpha game right tho feels like doesnt reward progress scale needs reward system set go area area locked gear leave anytime game strips utility items gear stats artifacts get retain progress doesnt feel strong make progression system like rougelike amazing reddit post makes even examples goes depth wish another way review game rather say yes moment wouldnt suggest getting game seeing game come playing middle school makes sad see amazing exploration game get lot reviews cubeworld quite unfair said however right alpha player received steam version additional costs quite happy game fun really extremely happy skill tree pet leveling removed pets use useless youd level far faster pet hated spending time farming level skill treewollay done great job dungeons questing extremely enjoyable however biggest deal breaker game going back square one entering different region first read thought going across sea another land would reset fine withbut isnt soon step foot another biome boom stuff becomes useless game fun enjoying alpha loot becoming trash region go leveling system needs changed order good game loot based leveling doesnt work functioning player xp essentially someone joins region gear class become god immediantly area making progression really brokenthe go spawn point harder game get shouldnt cap progression continue forever gear always get better bosses always get harder get rid capwollay please dont go quiet please fix game amazing wait id like give positive review lot went wrong game lot missing highly unbalanced quickly lose interest grinding behaviors region locking one im sure point read review explains poorly game made dont expect updates anything developers came quick cash grab catch road another years remake shitstorm however game really fun mods made community buy game strongly suggest download mods implement otherwise youll find spending hours achieve nothing masterpiece shyte wont even work windows gg dig locked discussions find bypass thanks big fu windows userswindows supported ggggggggggggggggggggggggggg fk game nice game gets bit repetitive nice gamecould use pulishing would still recommend nice looking world absolutely nothing novel ultimately shallow experience cube world worth playing alpha years ago many things reworked little content added empty game fun cannot recommend bought potential game years ago would purchase game final product poorly crafted gameevery time character moves new area adventure equipment resets advancement repetitive gathering items new area endless grind trying find fun never arrivesi wish hadnt spent long trying find fun could returned really fun game different alpha thats expected long game fun could still totally worth money opinion really good game even though progression system far optimal sadly wollay developer gone hiding sad disappointment wont speak hype game graphics anything like isnt makes game unfun gameplayi privilege play early version game way back basic game fun ride days worth content appreciate developer wanted make new exploration leveling system help make game stand execution somehow makes pointless progress levels gear becoming useless outside equivalent neighborhood items vanishing thin air moment leave neighborhood makes progression hardly worth whats point game reward hours work half percent total increase movement speedi lost interest game fast funny game polished welltuned around core system broken system minds welltuned regardlessif make suggestion developer wont look reply hardly doubt would would make explore new areas weapons lose strength gradually leave area star loot might become star way progress isnt hampered leaving explore neat ice biome another idea instead items like gliders bells special locations lock stat buffs across land small powers lead something buffs locked behind na enemy encounter boss fight want need explore different biomes area one key item lets say start grass land unlock glider ok cool find bell one dungeon ice area north whistle lava land south get ideai know countless ways improving game seeing months since point dont think wouldnt recommend game current state pick updated reviews changebut could add xp back would happy camper god miss scam wish could refund simplistic game doesnt really fit rpg tag although find game enjoyable isnt progression exp leveling system would great also enemies dont immediately one shot spawn ill leave negative could change sooner later updates roll around hope game teacher told cannot create know initial beta release cube world fantastic game hopeful amazing helped couple rough spots happy place never got updated developer got depressed still lives pc never removed longer possible get itthe released game feels like helpless spiral fight grow work hard build knocked every passing border never really surpass cap grow past certain strength level makes rough able surpass certain encounters especially one two melee classes sad depressing loop begins feel inescapable time exact opposite effect beta theres little way happiness wonder game feels somewhat like beaten dog cowering progressing past confines dark little cornernot games need happy game switched feel dramatically one beta recommend game unless either plan play friendsyou use mods cheats circumvent region locks something base product single player may hoping fori really want recommend game due personal history many hours sank reality sadly cannot recommend current state game without feeling like im baldfaced liar heres hoping wollay eventually reappear update review textbox example refusing feedback community remaining bubble cause make horrible development decisionsi used love game back alpha giving chance poststeam release became horribly clear dev wollay taken made interesting chucked dumpster replacing boring repeating system punished progressiondo buy thuroughly meh experience really pretty package early game tedious mid game actually somewhat enjoyable realize instead going adventures exploring new lands quest away items tools region locked found sailing across ocean discovered would mean character would basically start game scratch new area liked mans sky launch enjoy old school mmorpg questing might find something enjoy otherwise probably wont miss much ton people need review like new game forget know alpha game would good reviews wasnt alpha players complaining different big world much playable classes dont lot depth currently progression towards skills abilitiesthe progression game obtaining artifacts bonuses swim speedmount speed etc barely notice combat game feels like wants dark souls lite able dodge enemy blows use classes utility beat enemies reality easy encounters handful enemy templates act dont require skill beat could ramble im really bad reviewing thingsi enjoyed time playing beta type region wouldnt spend game depth meaningful progression makes feel like actually gained something spending hours one characterthe dev also showed bunch cool content twitter never actually added game fun game action packed world many towns temples lost shines many foes fight wide arsenal items buy obtain many artifacts collect giving bonuses climbing speed weapon damage think give game shot considering game kinda like skyrim cant beat game always something fan demo huge upgrade say try good game gives different experience would get rpg games gives game worth exploration moments ive following game since still lives hype appreciate game become giving pleasant experience game worth playing nice game bit like dd generator hit smaller mobs gear craft move new zone finished exploring start fresh mp fun freinds well gear stay region start next afresh unless gear much much explore like exploring game lot offer game shiny love hermits thumbs note never played first

helps best luck wollay game still developmenti high hopes game believe worth bought wollay still working development plans follow plans game eager see game look like future polished game nicely alpha version bringing formatting rest planned features game aaaah cube world game purchased back available month shop got closedmakes feel nostalgic also regretful state game released beginners rpg turned cobbled together mishmash interesting ideas fight much drains every amount fun game like thirsty vampire desertalso great silence wollay happened players didnt get update years neither game files informations regarding game except screenshots mechanics didnt make game got audience beginner casual gamer normal gamer expertthis game picked pretty much every type player warned mechanics simplistic quite rough unfair game plays like nothing think graphics bad alright good beautiful fantastic well voxel based cubes nothing special look nice animations feel kind stiff dont feel broken place thing noticed shader used alpha made cubes change hue slightly lighting giving something much natural nice touch blocks pretty much look regardless lighting music bad alright good beautiful fantastic thing game really feels whole gets annoying prepared get jumpscare complete quest sound loud difficulty easy average easy learn hard master hard unfairthis one tricky rng kind get really powerful weapon really early game doesnt restrict beginner using weapon easily oneshottwoshot every enemy even bossesif rng kind wont find anything helps getting rid monsters problem take hours getting anything useful problem gameplay section review bugs bugs destroy game lots bugs bugs use speedrun nothing encounteredive yet find mayor bugs except furniture clipping walls weird terrain generation errors put building top another somewhere lurking shadows probably bugs guess wont find done game story none bad alright good fantasticwell none except random generated lore nothing helps understand world cube world works lives breathes oh grave king killed snail neat thats pretty much yes text really something player got beta gameplay frustrating sleepy boring fun challengingthe gameplay oh gameplay opinion pain suffering awaiting brightly coloured worldthe first hours quite fun rngesus kind even find something good probably lose soon becausethe region lock system punishes player exploring advancing game exploration type rpg hinders use gear outside region except gear really frustratingly rare type gear usable kingdom aka region found neighboring regions leave though even rare gear powerful starting gear oh travel gear also usable region found need collect soon everything back probably done regionyou cant get stronger gear find helps survive skills use already unlocked start thats nothing nothing less skill tree nothing cant power character leveling system gear permanent upgrade find extremely rare artifacts region boost travel perks nothing combat stats change artifacts means without gear back square one soon travel another region killed low level mobs get gear puts top everything repeating boring cycle cube world gameplay game time length really short hours short hours hours hours long hours long hours extremely long hours gameplay handled two like set back working way back top without rewarding price game could something invest days worth time dont like set back complete one region seen everything cube world offers gameplay wise accomplished hours depending rng price quality full price wait sale dont buy refund canan explorationdriven rpg doesnt feel rewarding exploring playing like rpg pretty much sums whole debacle cube world whole game feels bland empty content invest money something punishes playing invest time everything every time cross border leaves empty giving feeling advancing getting strongerthis game promising back alpha stages became victim false promises badly handled development lacking communication devs sidemy final rating game dont buy even discounted price high long mayor problems arent fixed seeing wollay tackles problems community brings move get another game aaand im writing short review tooi cant recommend game stage simply games based progression progression implemented solely items items bound regions regions arent big lets imagine earn boat cool right sailing fun might think almost reach ocean biome jump water hitting key beautiful boat reach end current region precious boat soon touch border poof boat anything spent hours looking big mistake changing game way shame honestly would like refund wollay changes progression works cares abandoned neglected might well try trove free steammaybe itll reworked couple years later abandoned developers released halfbaked product felt like cash grab would definitely advise avoiding developer future future game releases try promise itll lead disappointment abandoned years game amazing region locked stuff changesrip cube world abandonware dev ran away money left us unifinished game got good qualities changed shit nobody likes nobody asked hours alpha gameseeing changes say quite refreshing playing gamenot much endgame really love fact start beginning every time switch biomeat beginning might seem hard get first weapon explore freely almosti love game good like exploring hrs love game region locked system refreshing non typical hate many people fact tried create something didnt play like every game makes every region like new play doesnt spoon feed entire time couldnt happier purchase absolute dog shite havnt played single game worse whole lifetimehonestly absolute flaming garbage pile game wanna actually try progress game run straight line careful dont die youll get send right back city started like minecraft minus good bits w added kill quests absolutely one wollay never accept cube world appears dare see could beme playing agree wollay absolutely notas someone paid alpha massive amounts fun waiting six years expecting similar progression content left let immensely progression system borderlandsyinfinite scaling rpg stats skills invest procedurally generated worlds interesting map generation robust customization lacked things like quests general interaction also supported direct ip super bigso beta comes adds quests general interactions everything else enjoyed gutted understanding procgen world replaced static one order make steam integration easier gear get entirety strength skills statlines even gear becomes useless change region makes going friend could hundreds regions away veritable chore interesting landmarks shaders gone specs required jumped arbitrarily game supports gamepads adopts really terrible unscaling ui scheme balance window everything scales much quickercomparing experience power fun say regions alpha felt like slow climb hill logarithmic curve beta many sharp mountains run around getting oneshot even passive mobs happen across extremely powerful gear sitting somewhere become doomguy clear everything enter new region rinse repeatthe rewards clearing region also lackluster best artifacts need clear region earn lackluster best scale incredibly poorly low stat caps every artifact also increases level dont get stat gains anything youll get lamp extends maybe half foot furtherthis seems developers decided erroneously hole work without feedback six years could prevented anyone way reach give feedback originally game much grander set content goals wellit feels like completely different game worse honestly speaking even regret getting hopes owning alpha absolutely terrible compared alpha version game game super confusing slow progression adventure game shouldnt weapons work certain areas stars game absoultly loved beta played hours tried got bored hours actually fun game actually bad good years ago developer money posted one update years waiting since update good ghosted us got game twice please stay away actually pretty good friends really bad without bugs manageable actually cubeworld solid game four classes different specializations quests dungeons interesting lootsystem bossesand play play fun refine character go different quests find items unlock lots stuff everythings finebut happens want go next area well everything gone reset everything except two things money levelthe motivation goneuntil problem solved dont give recommendation buy adventure progression two concepts inherently intertwined explored together countless times thousands different gamestldrcube world adventure game without progression thats bada bit

start another region well im simply due fact theres reason thing real rewardthe lack progression really removes keep playing much loved game play loop dont feel though gain anymore enjoyment simply thing different land would rerolling characterthe artefacts really arent worth trouble go get seems items stay together yes know gear even limited usefinal thoughts game currently lacking reason player interact games mechanics silly sounds players need rewards drive forward otherwise everything feels pointless add meta progression reason continue exploring region basically seen game offer lvls still progress get movement speed nothign else also reagion lock resets items everytime think worth hours game left little burnt lack meaningful character progression gameplay loop charming core regionbased progression interesting concept would like see developed however permanent progression character limited improving traveling capabilities intend play game little get sense class experienced gameplay guardian warrior would recommend starting class specialization would recommend game combat engaging aesthetic attractive heart lovingly crafted indie title present hours say game great fun price thats good valuei understand peoples complaints differences alpha features missing end day wollay pixxies creative project choice direction take inas wollay stated restarted scratch several times major changes expectedwith tweaks artifacts system could great ive fun time playing far continue enjoy colourful world cube world future shame amount people feel butt hurt changes seem simply want watch game burn sad hours gameplay completion close regions safely say havent enjoyed game much years first game feel deserves honest reviewfirst exploration great terrain looks amazing points interest cities ususal well spread making everywhere go something quirks generation like trees inside plateaus water rising ground levels makes fun find explorethe combat cheesy especially early sometimes late game region playing solo say enjoy lot finding edge make bosses circle leading shrines quickly respawn making repeatedly lose interest letting friend bait many ways fight creative way go fight whichever way prefernow game gear based progression region locked gearitems ive seen many complaints dont really see issues first glance looks like severly limits exploration looking deeper really promotes detailed exploration within every region yes losing travel items bit annoying figure things gearing advancing region go quickly besides whats difference monsters getting stronger getting weaker moving next area complaint artifacts kind useless besides showing friendsive played around alpha followed twitter past years see development going agree opinion release underdeliver considering long worked game whatever reasons im blaming project think amazing job could better yes course totally worth keeps development definitely encourage maybe game even surpass expectations hours give honest reviewwhats good fun repetitive every hours repeat youve already done people really love game play nonstop similarly tryhard would play pacman hourswait go sale maybe much think worth least updates hopefully come hours still pretty much appreciate new version cube world careful like alpha version prefer consider whole new game long years cube world back get review want say really wanted enjoy game amount playtime got well worth price far fun game base good adjustments need made game really shine lot issues game appear minor issues made worse bigger issue goes back progression wollay base alpha solid leveling great saying goes aint broke dont fix however tried something new experimented applaud game got put new direction makes feel dozen times fresh would nostalgic factor alonehowever lets get good old positives negatives musical score game amazing brings right feel great graphics good ever better optimization always achievable still pretty great department also base game good got good loop structure nice pets still awesome taming great controls smooth good ever shrines better ever honestly wayy better alpha straight one best improvements alpha regions look awesome map even improvednow negatives starting severeloosing items hang glider boat etc crossing regions bad heavily suggest maybe coming new items games progress make things interesting players get items removed items lost value makes players less interested game loot feels whole maybe instead tiers use item levels accordance far players getting starting region progression feels way fast game gets reset travel new region read last negative negative super importantfor rpg class diversity ability diversity customization isnt time presume added game great game deserves work needs best bepets great dont really feel diverse enough maybe give creatures abilities bond player adding complexity also cool affects choosing pets like bats could maybe shoot like blood shot drop fruit something night time wayyyy dark game brighten light reduce darkness night time bit lot better gui could use bit tweaking terms scaling pretty solidi sure could come honestly let alone issues got fixed game would easy dollars would reccomendbut current issues take solid keep mind average still saying average game honestly still worth every penny lot fun definitely going sink least couple hundred hours game knowing wollay issues get fixed amazing developer honestly looking forward whichever project next long years game waited long outa lot changed since alpha daysthis randomly generated rpglite infinite exploration progressionyour character levels artifacts boosts exploration stats like climbing diving timethe combat feels responsive fun indeed subjective review afterallthe game quite challenging gonna lie darksoulsy feel especially dungeons hard sometimes rewarding finish recieving artifact combat gear locked region though exception called gear rare items find late game every region makes wandering new region feel like new game everytimeall would recommend cube world exactly expected hoped would years give props sole developer wolfram put blood sweat tears passion project hope continues develop game content game infinite potential infinite fun years false promised features got shell great idea original alpha feels better updated version though even lighter content play risk price tag want aim years development hopefully would worth wait years away scene mad lad comes back game less content alpha grabs money hyped hands vanishes really want game go dont buy normal price since clearly overpriced check last update made hasnt touched since released chances wont touched another years time heavily dependent long money made lasts years development game still unfinished days worth gameplay everything starts mean different areas game leave one area gear becomes pointless get new gear area besides gear area specific xp system game currently leveling exist hope game gets finished one day beautiful idea years silence removed best part alpha rgp aspects released trash disappear years thinking money stolen back isnt even game want money back years waiting expecting yes simple grindy times hard times easy love game night time less night really hard see enemies even lantern feels like night time longer day time skill tree give better reason kill mobs wow exp skill tree made invest time game buy recommend watching video cube world first dont like grinding walking long time game isnt years game much content alpha fun play well course things could better region locking almost every item helps progress little frustrating game still fun combat great personally like new system old skill tree give chance pretty great friends years worth wait sixyear hiatus wollay pixxies voxelbased adventure game cube world actually back released many us old supporters put hundreds hours alpha essentially tech demo final product come unique twists previous gameplay changed enjoy polarizing isthe good alpha players got steam keys never ripped many believed long thats good show support game runs well well stable platform unlike venerable minecraft voxel style unique enjoyable also allowing things easily customized future wollay penned soundtrack game sounds fantastic immersive combat feels engaging requiring attention actively dodge aim attacks zones much smaller used much varied extra towns lorebased npcs wander respective zones zonebased events affect youre able giving targets aim artifacts lay hidden zone one increasing abilities time theyre acquired gear upgrades well giving real feel power level later zone get free flight steam friends time flight master move zone time slight caveatthe bad still building feature youre supposed adventure world anyway windows users download unofficial patch deal fact programmed sound handled differently word fix works game released missing certain key features wollay teased years massive cities grand quests leaving progression world feel samey tired may change future artifacts dont boost quite enough leaving player collect dozens feel real improvement unique world seeds one unfathomably huge game world youre still going see place twice unless go way thats place names random though may sometimes nearly varied could find character named ikoka ikoka enchanted forest ikoka hills may problem crafting isnt valuable since resources harder come alpha stay away communityatlarge unless youre sort masochist applies basically game show keep one hat laterthe uglyhow feel regionlocked gear big dividing factor game right get artifacts zone decked legendary gear got toys mobility go next zone lose rather hidden really used last zone earn mobility gadgets gear way last time get new artifacts zone exception gear allows bring next connected zone get headstart many lament makes progression pointless since youre going lose anyway ways theyre right games replacing gear next zone come wont scale meet new enemies cube world backwards since mobs dont levels instead gear scaling need replaced personally dont hate system overlycomplicated bad though need work anathema others inevitably add mod game removing bother play whole game cheapened since zones dont mess stuff leave isfinal judgement buy enjoy bad game shows whats possible team two make relatively cheap good time put dont feel like playing dont need live wait game kind let mean area thing cool becomes repetitive go get items gotten getting new gear wouldve liked seeing increase difficulty next zone gear really isnt good instead useless time playing since alpha thought six years game would changed better guess im wrong cant recommand game claims cube world knew loved eternity silence devs came back released steam likely milk extra cash new unknowing playersthey also somehow managed take good game throw window hour testing due recommendation friends refunded game wasnt fun another problem seemed graphics everything cubeshaped obviously correctly rendered shame beta tester game found really fun hours ive really explored area im still finish due bad gear drops honesty reason warrior gear yellow barely dropped alottttt room improvement quality life improvements long gets updated improved incrementally cube world amazing doubt though wait see game goes hats wollay excited game since loving beta quite cannot support suggest game anyone considering many backsteps taken development instead adding onto superior alpha build instead scrapped entirely remade game scratch added less content didnt promise showcasing years borderline scamming remaining playerbase permanently leaving bad taste mouth indie game fanssay want minecraft least minecraft didnt openly lie customers strip away features running away money like happened game wollay already shut devblog gone silent supporters money say least game dead dirt taken steam due game massive scam funded development years present cube worldyou start journey realize quickly difficult one overcome obstacles acquire gear reading lore talking artifact hidden nearby completing quests finally take clear end dungeon reward sailing speed artifact maybe next increase valuable stat like damage using newly improved sailing speed set new region three minutes traveling straight line suddenly drop water special items vanished gear useless staring blue thing think say thoi recommended alpha based upon potential actually released like unless nostalgia game like likely hard pass oddities get addressed completing regions hours safely say enjoyed game cannot recommend anyone current state point feel like ive almost seen everything game offer terms progression need play games current state lot issues game makes feel like progressing starting first time exciting exploring find landmarks however trying find gear upgrade first time difficult trying kill green higher enemy starter equipment difficult task small chance getting new piece gear may even class youre playing finding landmarks important find key items able use locked away items mobility items traverse world quicker gear increase overall power problem arises stumble across high rarity item like star star weapon find piece gear youre essentially steamrolling game first satisfying able melt enemies giving hard time afterwards though finding village find quests landmarks increase power since piece high tier equipment difficult complete quests gear point almost risk fighting anything even bosses hitting stars weapon armor level pretty much clear dungeons collect artifacts region artifacts increase combat stats climbing speed light radius diving skill minuscule amount clearing dungeons region measly percent per artifact stats feels bad gives real incentive really continue exploring regions artifacts however felt needed try another region give game another chance soon go new region star gear reduced back starter gear one worst things game way get around grind piece gear supposedly get completing region random chance works neighboring zones however leave zones item useless starter gear drop rate items rare found despite clearing whole zones completely grinding hour high level boss quest knowing going village find quests using map find top priority find high tier piece equipment get ball rolling getting regeared much faster time started feel bored feeling stronger first zone clearing dungeons measly artifacts feel satisfying first zone felt like replay entire game gameplay loop feels nonexistent felt need play longer need fact gameplay loop feels like downgrade alpha disappointing escalating difficulty flat reset feel like exploration rpg game felt like playing weak rogue like minuscule upgrades carrying materials consumables enjoy time playing game time felt like tedious busywork scouring every inch land find new landmarks lore complete zone however environments explored vast beautiful lot charm packed every little detail game however gameplay want keep exploring beautiful world lot improvements could made current time cannot recommend anyone get game countless hours gameplay alpha hours still recommend gameyea gameplay features overall addictive play reach certain level milestone eventually come back wonderful world friends even better played alpha beta last week mixed thought overall game terrible like type game isnt people put nearly hours path exile honestly game nice chill experience features arent really everyone looking forward updates future game offer sure modding

version written game drain game along couple ea projects got went sideways permanently ended interest prerelease backer gamefast forward years heard released steam skeptical year development cycle game simplistic earned mountain money alpha backers screams problematic turns skepticism well placedwhat utter failure release version game went somewhat interesting infinitely scaled yet raw unpolished game alpha getting unpolished uninteresting final release microscopic nearly flat progression fact pretty much armor items reset crossing invisible barrier would enough discourage playing xp system really anymore casts game trash binfor love gaming dont buy game would take miracle developer make steam version game appealing even dated basic many games better job doesnt even come close

punishment playing game used play game beta much polished loved mess voxels ah yes game big nice ah cube world game hadnt received update years straight nowhere revealed release gamethe game different alpha version player alpha hundreds hours say know difference alpha version game progression worthwhile yes alpha version fun times overall beta lot fun levels boosted stats linear progression skill tree could go ever wanted use new skills anywhere beta version changed played beta awhile writing review surely say lot different sense progression isnt thrown away except artifacts get later version game still kill enemies gain gear like usual whats problem might ask whenever leave region got gear automatically becomes practically useless use region got thing happens special items specials things like hang gliders region bound progress short answer really dont find artifact item gives stat boost boost often low isnt even noticeable pet speed artifacts pet speed went isnt damage boosting artifacts either mobility onesbut doesnt mean game bad playing lot fun new structures dungeons added made lot fun explore region size smaller structures packed together closer lot easier find something added skills class making lot fun attack fight enemies added music game sounds amazing game really needs tweaks progression feel worthwhile artifacts give stat boost damagehp boost etc artifacts introduced players lot hours game shouldnt level guy minutes leave regiondespite changes criticism give game good review really enjoyed fun ah cube world think new players case didnt know games first alpha released years ago people played alpha experience quite different one presented upon release current game version version quite different alpha number bad wayslist exp skills

negative feedback deter improving game good chunk us giving constructive criticism said though cant recommend game even like aspects game ipersonally think good place start remove regionlocked mechanic breaks enjoyment game encourages explore world yet punishes making gear utterly useless means gotta mindlessly farm hopes getting decent gear class course mean player keeps best gear times

looking towns enter new region towns also pretty cut dry real difference outside aesthetic ive explained problems fixed first two steps capitals arent necessary theyd add sense life world really needing finally listen community iits thinks game isnt good right look upon many many reviews game gotten youll see im alone go far better detail games problems ways fixed alfa version super good bring steam say motivationincentive progress game level within game know get grind meters lamp radius gear progress unique items reset per area explore infinite exploration game get punished iti recommend game anyone current state around lovely game years take away content wont get couple hours gameplay unless love grinding unbelievably repetitive game rewards run faster literally worth space takes steams store best features standard elements rpg taken since alpha released character progression solely done obtaining stronger weapons armor found quickly randomly ending challenge enemies would otherwise give rewarding receive strong weapons armor however become useless travel new area character effectively resets traveling new region something many times wish play game hours cycle becoming strong becoming weak far fast repetitive fun made worse fact little difference regions youll end barebones quests lasting rewardthe best part alpha reward spending hours leveling character occasionally finding gear upgrade knew would last many hours gameplay completely gone almost zero reward killing enemiesdont buy game major updates fix huge shortcomings years waiting fully rewarded new features like quests changes classes items gather zone instead skill points everything way fun previous version ill advise novice players never played cubeworld watch gameplay first tutorial explanations thoa blast people already played game gladly rediscover steam things considered good timewill continue enjoy game friends solohowever perfect exp system alpha way satisfying gave much gratificationskill trees added fun variationregion locking loot like winning prizes fair confiscated exitthe beta feels like completely different much better game alpha progression wiseoverall content good visually beautiful soundtrack fitting creates nice atmosphere lot fun play friends still journey ahead find item allow keep stats large radius spans across regions allow really love game early access came steam full release big let although game looks beautiful simple yet fun mechanics game falls quickly completing first zone time finish zone move next gear becomes useless start square one stay first zone much therethis makes lot replayability however going new zone difficult establish top makes previous accomplishments seem kind hollowoverall think could still incredible game current state little offer almost every mechanic seemed half baked charm mostly fluff enough meat sustain attention longer hours almost everyone played loved alpha hates game tell something absolutely recommended current state alot people seem hate game absolutely reason hard start think engage enemy picking fights either overpower maneuver exploration level grinding people really think keep high level equipment across new areas stomp even challenge like whatthe thing agree see people say cannot use equipment areas sense handglider boat reins honestly get game like good adventure game like plow jrpgs alpha fun alpha player bought game day one super excited game honestly want better experiences go play alpha version alpha way fun beta versionbeta essentially becomes tolerable get better gear getting point insanely fun friend gave gear could play together friend giving gear isnt something required start sort funi want like game instead improving good model game alpha went curved path picroma shut others updating game turning game like hate situationmy personal suggestion dont get version cube world find way play alpha wait picroma major updates change game functions someone manages mod cube world half player base wants listyou pet dogs reallynew biomes fun look interesting inclusion new dungeons quests unlock via skill tree boat glider usage adding lore interesting able see landmarks via mini map close new mobs added new landmarks visit biome generation cleaner new river spawning multiple layers levels fun see list way dark night nearly impossible see anything possessed humans towns attack fact waypoints dont auto mark flute playing required enemies attack waypoint sometimes start game camp ohko region locked gears pets vehicles channeling inner ign much water boats region locked exp level think possible make exp leveling cube world felt like small mmo alpha exp takes away initial charm say exp isnt possible isnt polished enemy scaling everything one two shot way bright vibrant color choices compared alpha feels like gammabright theres high contrast fact press ctrlscroll zoom character cant walk use map anymore towns lack lighting feel way dark night lack explanation game throws learn towns markers via map zoom drink potions full health game doesnt stop didnt alpha caves skylights even night lack skill tree think people hoping interesting detailed skill tree none saddening extra character customization dying often get teleported super far away makes highly annoying get back idea go start stamina breathing water meaning run stamina jump water actually drown asap waste enough time get endgame besides last boss easy game essentially forces new region want another challenge return essentially start scratch mobs possessed slime case chase forever leaving either die lead mobs kill hard make healing items small creeks seems everything big rivers ocean lakes minimap huge obtrusive list alpha player bought release played hours ill try keep clean promisesif first time seeing game review pretty good last hours really milking theres lot stuff explore find days im still seeing new things forums subreddit systems right fine new player expectations thus wont really seem like huge problems weird design decisions keep eye made mostly guy know else stardew valley early minecraft developer socially challenged dont expect proper communication upcoming features rational behind design choices kinda gotta take make something play millions games deserve time attention know didnt finish witcher cowardnow rest us familiar almost year old dramabeta extension full release fixes alphas fundamental problems lack content level characters infinite scaling making invincible god hours solutions adds combat somewhat half bakedresetting equipment special items entering new region worthless gold relic system reliance questsif youre reading youre probably familiar sides argument chances well game probably wont change foundation easy seeing creator spent past years building ideal world relics pick would give combat stats misc stats instead misc even better original spawn point went stronger monsters bigger relic bonuses dont need anything crazy like movement speed increases small incremental changes like tempo increase weird bonuses like upon roll gain movement speed buff seconds already mod region locking shows exactly happens take brakes realize shallow really game loop hunting next artifact effectivly making something closer rougelite rpg goal execution flopped unless someone wants link gear stats artifact stat rolling pool probably stay floppedcube world still little indie game flew close sun years ago different face get first relic see light radius kinda kicks wind sails assuming wife dont simultaneous mental breakdown go missing another years updates addressing issues nobody know actually looking kinda cube world right problems big addressed hopefully maybe dont get update forums twitter anything like month wait mod class action lawsuit coinflip communityedit remember said looking long wife dont tuck shells like scared somewhat socially challenged turtles surprise tucked ghosted us know whatif doesnt come back time dont care modding community showing promise unlike alpha mods questionable people actually give shit like games mods main issues fixed overall experience betterwe artifact stat bonuses weapon xp world generation building commands monk class revival mechanic start second time hes ghosted us cube world promising game terrible developer im shocked hope tbh almost year silence im willing admit hopeful mess dont let stop playing still recommend cube world sale especially mods alpha tester ill short onecombat uninteresting thats bad really enjoyed alpha version combat skill tree removal destroyed sort dynamics game first placeenemies strong point seeming unintentionally time found running throughout game running simulator looking enemies actually sort fighting chance hopes finding better gearleveling removal bad idea implementation terrible coupled region locking gear makes game repetitive boring regression rather progression really something want play long think level removal could justified gear get region would different function different regions stats ie better climbing stronger attacks certain creatures defense poisons etc love graphics unfortunately graphics equate good gameplay variety bright colors beautiful lighting although find somewhat annoying running dark dying high level enemy could see feet front even lantern absolutely adorable characters creatures found throughout game could go think probably strongest point gameallinall would recommend game current state game obviously potential great sadly marred terrible progression combat pretty much regardless pick fight vice versa certainly fun elements game many alpha version many removed also whered additional content developers tweets go looked awesome sad game worked drastically change like graphics would willing spend dollars meansone last note developer seems quite talented craft degree shame see state really looking forward replaying updated cube world met starting scratch way hope developer reach community feedback id certainly willing help way anyone things getting sort message across someone using ddos attack malevolent forms attack help get something want someone look find stupid idea saying thats happened dont know anyway heres hoping better future gameedit short though going digress alpha blah blah blah game great ton fun playing game hours sessions love sounds exploration progression overall feel game alpha better far version still fun sometimes id get sale alpha better imo alpha better beta want love game much cannotthings gamecharacter levellingskill treespet skillsmore classesmore racessub classes sure theyre game momentthings gameregion locked looti add soon cant bothered finish review eggs alpha player let fill among voted negative game first gear resetting isnt terrible judging people complaining exploration alpha way easy youve settled legendary gear weapon entering new continent rebuked gear gives fresh start start grinding better gear section sure may get repetitive continent along artifacts obtained wont serve much purpose anymore yet game years ago fun experience still believe still could one give time moment needs developsecond stated partially earlier sentence still development devs still room grow change early pass negative verdict slow paced development game experience ive kickstarted game took equal years done released people seem find worth valued wait wellnot trying defend game like heart soul feel lot unnecessary hate perceive standing angles fairness considerd game beta undergoing early access alpha player herethis game gave much hope future six years later thats end world tho broken least see inside buildings people well makes playing hard fun fixed wont playing anyone thinks end gaming pc drivers updated working last night tried minutes would love tell everyone think changes dont like exp region lock cant really dont want play game broken hopefully play update reviewupdate well got working launching folder steam fixed graphics bug actually got playthis would like tell everything great case removal exp leveling makes game feel unrewarding dont want quest clear area enemies get new powerful piece equipment descale go new zone locking special items like boat glider dont really bother equipment thing silly removal exp leveling took feeling progress leveled got new skill point maybe unlocking new skill use new item makes game unrewarding quite frankly empty sure world really cool map system fantastic gameplay repetitive little reward dont see pointi think game still chance becoming something great take time happens many years already waiting many realistically stay interested maybe year two look back see things fixed fun put back expanded upon im doneps download program tricks game removing region lock helped keep going another hour two still enough take hours time id download alpha build really want play cube world fun version alpha player reviewthis quite disappointing long time wonder took long remove many good mechanics wants game exploration walk broad landscapes see little quests come across way could slowly gather stuff journey make stronger fight powerful enemiesit gamethe exploration fully limited forcing player find tool make exploration manageable punishing player moving far spawn point regionlocking equipment think kind misguided attempt balancing late game something unacceptablethe leveling system removed equipment basically theres levels listed equipment unable find real difference even better quality gear improvements minor even worth anyone want attack speed upgrade thats get good equipmentthere used lot potential game need full rework actual gameplay order even worth considering alpha player wanted love betarelease sadly seems gone backwards terms gameplay forwards feelsbadman alpha ver better alpha version content felt like wouldnt recommend also treat beta version might get content another years alpha version hours hours funbetarelease version hours hours funi got bored game hours lost adventure soulin new version many cool items eg map quests treasures map also killing adventure filling quests need completed bored iteration quest items need gathered every zone almost killed etc literally cant ride another zone rains regionlocked tooalso many cool changes world generator ive play hour alpha review alpha version significant better case beautiful neat new version still looks fine many elements looked harmonic objective find internet comparison old new ocean biomessomething get wrong game six years silence moved wrong direction thinkin opinion alpha version significantly better current version good still play ityou buy play probably fun probably want go another biomeregion maybe repeat cycle times eventually got bored enough forgot game alpha version fun followed wollay twitter see could get nice updates seen twitter cool version also many things got weird removed hope dude improves game next years feedback instead seen breath wild great could great game fucked much grindnot diverse items also fucked combat system seems underwhelming balancedif wanna give tryplay offline mode like may want refund hours costs way much might buy sale gets updated time alpha fun version play one quiet boring spent hours clear zone basically get artifact doesnt increase nearly anything repeat progress traveling takes forever specially get instantly killed game choices made version bad exp system traveling takes forever spawnpoints pain changing zone basically resets ill change review change boring broken game alpha great thing whilst beta definite highlights stripping away things made cube world great beginning left us empty shell im sad mad enjoyed alpha enjoyed beta short region alas finally rest goodbye cube world alpha amazing played time waited years game update add loved beta came clearing zones found disappointed recommend game anyone timei hope make better updates even though hyped friends past couple years turn around tell hours beta game current state terribly dull things made great gone cry ever night since beta could alpha awesome actually fun play full release however alpha better alpha better alpha better alpha better alpha better alpha better alpha better alpha better bs alpha better hope community mod never trust dev alpha better somehow took bunch fun stuff probably figure community dislikes changes though change review alpha better still glad play tough alpha better beta alpha better beta wouldnt recommend current state alpha better alpha better thats shame also worth recommending due lack contentthe solution content draught created meaningless grind opposed sense character development graphics nice aesthetic style pleasant sound effects pretty basic music although fitting also quite bland alpha better worth alpha brokenbeta broken differently mecanics could good without region lock better link regionsrelease missing many contents alpha announced game first went sale vision see future critics listened todo fun cube world yes fun would recommand game state alpha far better beta beta unplayable alpha much better beta fact lose weapons change regions terrible alpha much better launcher doesnt workregion locked gear equipment sucks fun game alpha much rewarding fun play alpha good fun wasted money alpha way better lmao alpha way better response creators updates anything obviously cash grab partvery disappointed high hopes able play friends alpha version ported steam check mate id play hours budslosing gear zone zone tho biggest thing originally enjoyed years ago exploration thats longer optionif game ever fixed allowing mods otherwise ill probably change review hopes crushed alpha way better wish would never released could hope meme good release day absolute garbage alpha way better alpha worth came current one wouldnt even play even free alpha would nice alright im going real really like game heres thing people want levels progression feels ton skill trees different abilitys maybe even passive ones feels like ton progression probably lesson difficulty lesson difficulty practicly unplayablei enjoyed alpha much better added instead making whole new systemi cant call rpg way right though thoughts rpgs skills levels thats alright tough one absolutely loved alpha flaws still fun mechanics changed best faith recognize system right broken imo system need slight adjustments penalty changing regions little nonexistent essentially actually like fresh start changing regions excpecting game change alot people fit standards retarded im thatnow ive seen big part community berating ground anger deserves critisism course fine line critisism outright insulting let man give time redeem right world angry agree see perspective needs fixing dev team give breathing room alright need place much emphasis gear levels reason majority people tie value trophies numbers form accomplishmentthe new direction game taking moving away classic numbers games clearly focusing journeyyou need play game friends enjoy journey tying much epic sword koth tol zarrak instead laughing time autistic friend charged hive hornets diedif want play numbers game go play wow dont mean mean way play game clearly directed banging head meta climbing gear ladder wollay please expand concept make great make journey focus thus far enjoy although dont like region lock fixed simple implement mod really like game find lot fun think wait till gets fixes changes unless friends willing play mod blast although ton people arms differences alpha game bought years ago promises dev update finish product time absolutely love gotten well worth entertainment sure levelling system different dont think leads less enjoyment wish lore dungeons worlds would little varied thats certainly within games right continue growing although alpha player love game come many complaints game game im sure many people would agree personally think zonebased items rpg adventure game completely pointless makes everything accomplish zone feel obsolete believe cause problems new players full release may feel disappointed almost every bit progress zone lost feel like could sorted conquer every point interest zone zones items become items also think defeating enemies unrewarding exp skill upgrading system mention defeating enemies purely luck based close skill required purely based gear alpha player point makes feel overwhelmed underpowered could take enemies much stronger skill win another point id like quickly make also lose key items upon entering new zone make adventuring eventually become tedious enjoyable really bad rpg adventure game believe made key items stay upon entering zone however finding key items new zone key item gets small buff eg small boost hang gliding speed one final point id like make artifacts feel unrewarding buffs gives far teeny meaningful boost believe way improve would add skill point system artifacts give skill points add stats skills subclassdo recommend believe time effort working community recovered although changed lot since alpha still great game many fun things although conventional rpg years ago still great game fair price new players using conventional xp levelling system quite strange first continue explore finish quests end lot fun may everyone amazing game still although perfect takes bit get feet first game really enjoyable fun friends find clearing areas starting friends join get gear although changes would neat fleshed overall hands worse alpha definitely worth purchase hopefully mods come fix dont trust tiny dev team even want fix although game still bugs development neededthe game fun lets explore vast world filled adventure decide play one choses go foward game needs updates development dedication support take game full potential fun absolutely fun fun like beta way exp system go skill tree thought region lock idea would good balancing areas thinking going back old save file play feel like progressing anywhere im running around enjoy quests doesnt feel rewarding going pyramids beta beating boss something beating dungeon actual quest feel better real quest isnt flavor anymore many good things removed excited game still going play pure love beta man disappointing bring back exp system stupid artifacts bring back skill tree get rid region locks balance game like fun like beta confused watched people play game six years ago excited play game different thing seems art style supposed playing im little confused exploring seems like fun get creamed easily quests much quests go fight bit unstructured difficult start amazing game highly recommend ive played since alpha amazing game except alpha better original amazing game waiting years moment became playable love amazing game really felt depth playing game first spent hours trying figure kinda sucked first grasped adventure took flight amazing experience hoping future updateskind regards guy love game amazing game glad made comeback amazing game worth visuals alonegameplay fun well super openended whatever like youre forced specific quest anything also theres secrets people game havent discovered yetdont listen outrage try tbh great amazing game didnt get hooked game since little probably follow developement since first blog posts im happy see finally become reality got good couple hours week already im nowhere near getting bored yet diverse biomes region based progression keeps game fresh challenging times one games keep coming back every get bored time verdict definitely recommend bucks steal honestly amazing game love human buy amazing title screen simulator truly stunning wonder actual game better title better ign amazing worth wait absolute tragedy never really got game since finally releasing steam thought itd good opportunity play remember times actually play old version game times pretty good however new version game full flaws like seriously every time enter new area gear becomes trash state progression game genuinely depressing wouldnt recommend anyone game adjustments made judging creator handling situation dont think ill ever recommending amazing game amazing title developed couple blast play friends awsome game would fix like old days endless adventure pointless empty progressionoh boy ill start one pro game aesthetic look beautiful despite blocky manages separate another minecraft clone thats good cuz nothing like minecraft cube worldonto bad alot changes alpha used make game wonderful progression fun leveling acquiring skills good mayve slow progressing getting stronger could upgrade customize gear enhancing progression literally removed progression permenant anymore everything region based gather gear get key quest itemsand progress region soon leave region useless used boat dont soon pass region line hp drops back first started game damage becomes pathetic time find gear jump cliff use glider cover good ground fall like idoit longer glider youre used literally fighting one region near region line fighting star enemies accidentally crossed line didnt notice region change hp dropping nothing engaged star enemies got immieadtely doesnt feel good leave region try gather gear relics thing doesnt get made useless upon region change doesnt enough offset exploration grinding get star gear back honestly pathetic base progression relics difference someone level someone level someone got relics small percentage differences lamp radius swim speed climb speed gliding mount speedits disappointing mess couldve much relics even hyped read certain relic someone traveled another region learned mana transformation power surged lore stuff nothing like found ring talking climb faster incredibly fun game back alpha came still fun negative reviews mainly people upset minor changes made beta cant get getting perfect game envisioned paid way back wheni highly recommend getting game especially friends game finally came played hell alpha version game mainly pvp server unfortunately dedicated pvp server release impossible also combat changes pvp awful im fine since game great playing solo cooperativewell progress system people dislike really far weve got alpha opinion however need tweaks sure find good enough actually like progress system works im region im still impressed gorgeous game looks also good variation landscape biomei enjoy cube world mostly exploration aspect makes continuously play never get bored find funny dont want play another class im constantly progressing ninja character havent explored every biome variation yet love visuals also love taming pets like npcs wave dance soundtrack excellent one per biome eg ocean biome changes points interest ui much clean however hotbar goneim currently level means got artifacts collect artifacts main objective cube world dont go explore new biome artifacts rewarding enough make excited go another region one problems game dont really care honestthe game lacks tutorial player friendly dont piece information play inside game causes people hate game misinformation recommend check tips creators twitter pixxie tips forum go official site playingthats im glad finally play full version game wolfram created im waiting new content coming soon score id give game current state much come release weve seen twitterthis game awesome recommend apparently game still development wollay sharing details public thru emails hope thats true people aware fact one guy making game full time span six years fun project calm flaming hot cheeto fingers lick dorito dust sweaty nerds game tho looking forward wollay future game artifacts need relevant order provide steady gameplay loop feels rewarding still consider got moneys worth though support game future first time player gamethis adorable love lot keep amazing work child loved alpha remember playing nephews brothers hours end game amazing back hearing game going released excited get back friends online even purchased game extremely disappointed outcome years updates game feels like everything could gone wrong game xp progression system like gear locked certain zone even bother going next would start every time walked certain distancei tried really hard find good aspects game find limited even want need continue im going start every time ill back anything positive towards game made stands wouldnt pay dollar game truly sad dude spent hundreds hours alpha six years ago instantly fell love game heavy heart leave negative review pros beautiful looking game exploring world feels great utilites combat funcons progression incentive keep playing got bored hours reward completing area grinded hours complete first area find gear would disabled next region got keep artifact made lamp glow bit brighter falsely advertised rpg rpg elements left game rpglike feature select character starting screen upgradable skills left game decision making xp even upgrading weapons gems useless since lose soon cross bordersummary core design game needs rework either bring back old leveling system form progression least give artifacts stats actually matters small combat stats increases would fine would probably give motivation play game hundreds hours even better added unique stats effects artifacts could customize build character something needs change never play game fan cube world available roughly years ago enjoyed immensely fast forward years extremely sparse communications times thought project dead teasers systems like questing gave us hope suddenly receiving notification steam release new version really ramped excitement anticipation beloved game would finally feature complete assume many others either stayed late got early download early release beta great excitementthe sets scene disappointment soon followed sure teased features game however whole game changed fundamentally gone gentle progression finding loot defeating enemies staples rpgs indicators progression removed follows xp gain equivalent indicator progression completely removed fighting pretty much waste time avoiding overland combat way go seems fight seems character incapable learning successful fight xp level gain meant represent order progress must find artifact region along dungeon gear basis progression isnt necessarily terrible concept however game cross regions lose gear benefits essentially making start beginning ill admit dont understand latter part implemented dont find fun leads becoming powerful within region cross invisible zone border essentially get reset back beginning warning without kind reasoningthere exist plus gear indicated sign retain benefit across adjacent zones found yet even eventually become useless away move artifacts grant small bonus movement type stats however kind useless current implementation really much reward clearing zone mob strength horribly unbalanced right die lot fighting even lowest level critters may forced slay puppies bunnies although imagine tweaked pointconclusion game current state feels like hill grind master zone feel like achievement first time dropped cliff new zone grind loop simply uphill climb drop cliff rinse repeat want explore world find fun disincentive actually explore reset every zone simply isnt game fell love enjoy direction gone long developer hiatus fan original implementation direction seemed going nonzero chance dislike current implementation always reserve right change opinion facts cause wish developers well cannot recommend game currently former alpha thing say im really sad game ive tried enjoy see picky changes didnt expect game fun ive following game years passion love completely died reason played long sake old memories unfortunately stay pastrest peace cubeworld really hope wollay dont go missing recognize project kept shut long dead long time supporter unfortunately disappointed become project become drastically different spirit game originally however im still willing give wollay benefit doubt use honest relevant criticism make game better learn mistakes dont go silent us give us least roadmap future content youve tested last years lolfor new players picking first time definitely interesting experience yet replayability still seenfor returning old players keep open mind different thats alpha development goes anymore alpha still found online b conclude recommend game current state honestly bafter hours gameplay ive played regions completion certain point everything carbon copy different skin top meaningful character progression storyworld based progression systems youve zone hopped times start wonder whats really goal keeping engaged b updates prevail coming months see game community thriving longterm bbest luck next months wollay co still keen see go new player im loving game love wondering around exploring something new old cube world player im sad wait going lie game wasnt sold website downloaded cracked big brain wollay stopped selling level warrior account level rogue account exited heard coming steam hoping see good advancement updates wollay years saw product upgraded downgraded sadly old cubeworld better skill tree leveling system even maybe new crafting recipes new mobs items rpg game levelingproper level trees etc essential wollay threw away mechanics im satisfied long wait game actually become something good play playing old version much fun reasonable new players recommend playing old version sadly find somewhere else download cracked player play alpha cube world must state experience game absolutely freshit seems reviews people played alpha happy way wollay changed direction gamenow watched quite amount gameplay new cube world buying indeed pique interest think region lock mechanic im seeing alot people complain perfect could definitely handled better really bad least gives nice incentive keep goingi think system perfect feel like negative reviews fans vision game also completely understandable teasers wollay posting depicted different things coming game like skill tree didnt make release however things change game development changes still first iteration game personally feel game even amount playtime sinked highly recommend want new unique rpg experience amount updates wollay could give game extremely high looking forward even content time goes solo project game quite impressive sound effects music delightful proc gen terrain second none opinion general flow within single zone good think wollay great foundation build one critique want compelling bridge get zone zone impactful dungeon rewards maybe perks harder endgame zones enemies etc alpha backer brings smile face game still needs iron flaws like miss form skill choice besides subclass options something pets like way going right trying something different ive enjoying far difficulty high first soon find flow slowly accumulate items gets better something god kill anything plan carefully try tactics every step way one boss might need head tactic another might require pet tank make use roaming allies enjoyed challenge far hope keep expanding way im excited content whenever may come right ill need loads hours explore new sights areas gather lore artifacts alpha supporter lot say game positive negativethe visuals pretty charming creating unique came trove art style stayed true way release gameplay mixed bag many reviewers already written feels like long endless grind without major rewards untraditional loot system ask players fitting game overall game feels per experience extremely polished well made bugs weirds far apart however feels like game missing content end game goals booting game feels new refreshing exciting quickly loses steam becomes repetitive grindy game special players best played one friends dont fit either would recommend trying totally different alpha game old alpha player super hyped news cube world upcoming releaseafter played minutes became clear wasnt cube world playedthe game kept name art style thats iti decided give game chance hoping would find stuff like itlets clear current state beta cube world one worst game played year tried multiple time time end using close game frustrationeverything wrong every system flawed still think game saved updates still think problems deeply rooted wontcant addressed properly without completely rethinking game ok lets start goodthe game cute didnt evolve much since alpha version thats good thing animations simple work well art styleyou still create character choose classthe movements fluid running climbing feels goodand thats pretty much biggest problem cube world progression probably worst thing comes rpgwhat mean cant keep gear areas way find gear star even work couple areas still useless others combine fact cant gain exp anymore get super frustrating game never rewards wayshow level simple need explore map find artifacts gives useless buffs works area found found something like level gain pretty much nothing yayof course loot gear monster super low drop rate time cant equip another class well need able kill thatwhen start youre basically worst fighter existence cant even kill chicken depending classwarrior pretty good parry ranger gets obliterated two hits even weakest enemiesso basically youre walking get artifacts carefully avoiding enemies area really huge sometimes walk min even without seeing single temple places teleport resurrect get one shot enemy couldnt see redo min walk either youre lucky drop level weapon class first enemy get play game youre youre walking walking dying walking walking dying get pointthe game developed without ever consulting players shows many levels hurtsits like everything good alpha lost makes sadthere seem lot hate game forums pains spend time writing review thought important care game old player coming back relive experience im pretty disappointedevery time enter new zone gears stats get set back become pretty much useless honestly lot fun playing first zone started knew time enter zone gear gets basically locked instead taking new gear harder zone gear downgrades new zone slightly difficult anyway makes lack sense achievement satisfaction discovering new powerful gearwhen get rare item meant feel awesome gets downgraded minute leave zone feels like cheap mechanic squeeze playtime people results making people feel unnecessarily annoyed pissed good game designas og player im disappointed happy majority mechanics old game wanted new content update delivered decent amount content new progression system sucks much draws away everything great updatemaybe new player might fun picking first time going open mind might cup tea might next game looking considering many others waited almost years progression system enjoyed removed honestly disappointedperhaps mind change future ive played really isnt fun edit mind still hasnt changed annoying wollay left us dark beautiful fun first played alpha disappointing game turned would still recommend played around hours enjoyed greatly isnt perfect many problems isnt complete garbage like reviews say changes think like progression isnt tied leveling anymore meaning wont actively looking group friendly npc clean area get cheep exp still get loot almost worth enemies arent strong enough case dont think npc survive fight let alone new artifact system encourages explore whole region instead aimlessly changing location hopes cheesing enemies one region locked items prevent changing areas please forcing craft gear stand chance another area way enemies dont scale hp make feel like dont progress hand scailing enemies stay becoming weaker weaker untill one shot anything isnt bossthis changes might bit pain improvements dont exhaust gameplay fast keeps new biomes locked actually earn progress towards still arent locked able move new area time want great foundation game current state cannot recommend reviews explain current gear system artifact system lack feeling progress made game leaves wanting additionally content worked seemingly didnt make final game posted various places internet including developers personal twitter main website absent final version im unsure reason developer said started game scratch multiple times point could eliminated either way current game leaves wanting systems place work tweaking additions could end becoming fantastic game needs updating things went previously im sure worked hopei update review future updates improve game game isnt wanted progression gone exact thing made game popular gone left complete remake game least thats looks might sill redeemable everyone let would difficult thank alpha relased wolley thank leaving game completely dont think game recover however get updated see youll changed cant recommend game might biased playing alpha come expecting built watered rpg elements removed actual leveling kept fighting system enemy difficulty progression feels tedious rewarding hours playing accomplished little nothing region locking equipment movement itemsside note movement items game turns walking simulator time since lost everything moving new region also avoided oceans like plague didnt want spend hours swimming around finding boaton hand really well put together bugs everything works designed besides small value changes madethe reason feel like new system doesnt work well alpha progression strictly relative spawning world new character versions left powerless nonforgiving land full creatures would almost always one shot alpha version run around scrape xp loot could weaker creatures cumulative accomplishing task rewarded experience stronger gear grew better chance surviving future situations eventually would strong area would start exploring outward away region starting one stronger mobs dungeons would get leaving challenging enemies needed get stronger order fight leveling also rewarded increasing ability travel since walking time consuming good scaling rpg mechanic let player control difficulty willing challenge according difference strengthin beta run around scrape loot could weaker creatures promise would temporary increase ability fight cases ability fight adjacent regions walking around couple hours collecting bunch quest items became able ride pet hand glide open new areas new key items would eventually collect equipment could actually use strong enough get artifacts new way increase noncombat stats lucky enough artifacts didnt get put lamp radius increases whole meters per artifact artifacts region nothing left offer walk next nearby biome lose glider pet reigns ect everything point one shotting need spend hour walking around get town repeating process region sort rpg mechanic instills nonscaling artificial difficulty curve get powerful enough instead enemies getting stronger ability kill strong enemies taken away rather character growing becoming able overcome stronger stronger challenges repeats difficulty curve minor improvements already limited thingsnow believe game updated get better time cannot recommend current state things like pet riding glider region locked probably removed pointless time wasters fixed progression cube world feels like im fighting friction forced designs dont fit together right experience two versions opinion formed result experiences apologize seems hard understand literarywise brain doesnt information encryption properly ill clarify stuff need betldr developmentwise masterpiece well designed horribly executed progression play time superior result stands right wouldnt recommend game participated alpha ages ago honestly game hasnt really improved much allprogression slow would fine didnt feel like every time went new area starting game permanent progression game items make getting around tiny bit quicker keep consumables materials pets areasits disappointing long wait game isnt fun game fun would recommend alpha player update alpha dont recommend personally ive enjoying experience far even different way different almost feels like new game alpha long ago b standalone game fun perfect bthe region locking stands good use many resources craft full set top tier gear stomp one area soon cross border without realizing get oneshot random mob could fixed interesting unique ways like example rather gear obsolete instantly scale away original region even gear autoswap gear new region even simple popup saying gear obsolete would help unique equipment also region locked makes annoying remember zone looking map going hunting gear artifacts also useful somehow though even issues still fun play region locking makes end using different types weapons tiers like one region boomerang next bow last crossbow sure easily kill tier bosses one area next fun difficult time tier boss varies gameplay makes interesting play even first area cleared b bunch changes need made though bthe region lock harsh would much better systems make gear valuable say like collecting artifacts region made gear fall less would make seemingly useless artifacts much better certain artifacts allow carry unique equipment surrounding number zones rehauling map structure procedurally generate zones would allow region lock removed make zones scale difficulty im game developer dont know would difficult add feel would make game much fun less punishing wanting explore new areastldr game fun really bad mechanics built personally dont ruin game definitely polarizing youre looking game alpha barely game sure classes weapons skills mechanics make feel like sequel something along lines recommend game think looks interesting want cube world years ago long gets updates worth pls people long know youre getting buy game great dont buy expecting infinite item progression unless use mod currently gaining popularity p still plenty single player playtime youll get bored mention multiplayer people already said regionlock essential items ruins entire experience would like start every time would enter new region woul simply create new game makes entire thing worse fact arent dynamic quests every single time need collect item clear dungeons rewardunlock thererfore new regions arent even new adventure much dont want say urge purchase game current state originally part alpha like better sticking old client game everything made game worthwhile essentially gutted turn added numerous region lock restrictions almost every element used make game enjoyable hope game ends molded something worthwhile since already years honestly dont see happening biggest feelsbadman year much really wanted like game waiting years play cant really recommend game current state much id love say game improved drastically since alpha pre release cant fully recommend current state new questing system present game overall huge increase previous one alpha certain new features presented quite quirky game needs much explaining really necessary order play properly enemies first areas extremely difficult lack levelling system currently theres way really power order take challenges playing water mage traversing surrounding area hours trying find single item weapon give edge go new area find weapons armor useless even alpha levelling system personally think world much interesting explore defacto way play game still alpha purely somehow felt finished wholetldr game much fun current state come back later much love cube world alpha please buy game right nowplease wait another month updates see game becomes wasting money like thousands people current state id give alpha depth current game although alpha already tons stuff missing much wanted love game full release canti played alpha way back day well honestly yeah worseits much worse fact modding game mandatory enjoy huge problemi really really wish game still good noti honestly wouldnt surprised wollay intentionally ruined game people would leave alone thats merely thoughtsif considering buying game please take note require mods semblance funand even bitter heart reccomend supporting indy devs good time devs need give fans proper communication wollay extensive history communication months years cannot support project game gets updates better ill happily revisit update review accordingly right worth asking first time playing really enjoyed relaxing easy play little googling controls great modding potential release stay away game lot us bought game early access expect game stay game impossible however design choices made release absolutely fun rewarding game definitely evolved devolved point stood years ago though many hours way game worked completely changedinstead levelling character permanently progression item bregionb based causes struggle players constantly grind restart benefit completing whole region artefact gives player near worthless benefit increased travel speed system implemented prevent players levelling character within week stopping playing game believe harsh toned especially since levelling difficult begin gear obtained pure luck point time almost everything one shots players adventure minutes find enemies killable otherwise stronger enemies lured npcs defeat enemies player slightest chance gear usable classthe old promised skill tree also gone benefit skills unlocked begin game gear centredwollay wife definitely done good jobs though idea gathering new travel options differently levelled enemies new quests dungeons new biomes easily interactive map changes made classes bcube world isnt gone hasnt destroyedb believe best wait bit longer better progression system least change doesnt make reset every hours mean game entirely unenjoyable enjoyed quite hours especially disregard fact region lock thing sense achievement still carry throughout everywhere main issue game game worth buy played game years ago absolutely loved completely agree getting rid exp system quite annoying seeing people cheat time like wolley going game fact said waiting release game perfected bothers put countless hours game things changed least responds community agree community feels like hardly reward spending hours trying find artifacts region locked items hard get used game general hard start found artifacts stats increase percentage goes smaller smaller time suggestions something along lines changes believe game would much launch pads shrines map huge takes long get point point b go new region start pet special ability feel like isnt much point finding new pets serve basically purpose attack sometimes run circles anything ride probably one best parts game climbing completely broken press e climb makes fall time alphas mechanics plus items difficult find work surrounding areas mobs touch unless find better weapon basically useless regions think plus items whole entire different menu crafting gui would give much better reason find resources like emeralds sapphires especially cotton super expensive difficult find finally think instead completely useless items region locked well biome locked items found certain region example jungle biome stats another jungle biome uselessness biomesthe game still fun play within hours days gets tedious boring sure lot people agree get wrong aspects game fantastic wolley needs listen community bit least answer questions many people getting ignored basically feel punished progressing game fun friends even hours becomes tedious hope something changes within next weeks see community dying quickly loves idea feel game huge potential would love see game thrive release cant recommend region issues reviews mention arent major issue major issue progression difficult intraregion enemies reasonably defeat starter gear lot time spent finding appropriatetiered enemies actually fight get good drop often steamroll content region without effort since theres xp progression inside given region entirely luck based get drops weapons classes youve gained nothing allthis spite game lot nice touches lore beauty world generation despite since core gameplay loop isnt satisfying entire game ceases satisfying youre either extremely underpowered given challenge overpowered afterthought little right able recommend people play lot content supposed plus region locking gear artifacts make extremely un fun game play loop especially grand misfortune spawning ocean dont know bug swimming hours end find boat used section ocean ideal way play game missing post sums review hours gamei currently spent hours solo rest friends solo gameplay isnt bad get relatively stale awhile game usually fun friends though awhile also seem get bit stale kinda means game lacking game currently region locking mechanic means gear youve collected throughout gameplay locked current region except regions artifact weapons one seems understand get quite work artifacts really provide miniscule addition one current stats diving stamina glider stamina etc exact however stack manage get lot artifacts combat isnt horrible however great alpha deal damage enemies higher weapon level doesnt really feel good alpha cant really kill bosses much bigger level via skill based good weapon means get really good weapon region practically done still really like game however definitely going game hop friends really bored need find something kill time recommend currently im sure dont love hate game played huge part childhood along side everyone else remember playing much friends

gets updated currently thing hurts game artifacts dont mind restarting region holy god artifacts suckglide speed dont even keep glider move another regionlamp radius aside dungeons uses outside go inn sleep daylightdive stamina biomes land based unless specifcally choose water biomewhat want free damage armor health anything make time new region easier survive weapon teirs form stars apply artifacts higher stars stats given man makes worse cant even use crafted gear next region get expensive youre crafting yellows time youre crafting youve probably already finished quests current biome kind pointless one alpha players cube world thrilled see wollay releasing end september said comparing alpha version beta version kind disappointed dont get wrong kind like game see future gets tweaked right way playing first region excitement quickly wears room joy getting good gear get legendary weapon oh well trash next area fact artifacts weak making feel like repeating neverending cycle grinding without reward would say wait future updates buy game preteen first picking game friend would spend hours excited day hop grind dungeons years friend kept tabs game update finally came hopped excited play aspects game removed annoying region locking appeared dont want hate game devs appreciate effort game forever heart dont think continue follow game rip cubeworld bought cube world back pretty much given expecting hear anything im glad developers able finally release block art style still really appealing shame full release hadnt lived potential shown previous alpha version cube world isnt exciting six years hope see developmentbased changes alpha lack communication updates long period cant recommend currently someone bought game played two hours returned game waiting update long time feel game take another many years get community wants playing game great potential lacking dev updates dedication keep game going meet full potential someone play beta find cube world well worth price ive heard murmurings supposed could lot like end day cube world great experience far like style little explanation even meant didnt figure could fast travel move map around late still fun

regionsall wollay great appreciate time effort would certainly say game worth price bit morepsyou pet friendly animals thats solid feature whos good giant alpha dog yooouuuu aaarrreeeee someone didnt play much alpha cant really compare old version game important isnt version gamewith said personally enjoying regionzone locked mechanic game successfully defeating every big baddy first region headed new one essentially youre starting find new gear regionrestricted items yes frustrating find refreshing wants strong carry regions whats point finding artifacts gives stat bonuses carry matter go plus completing regionsexploring big part game part enjoy mosthonestly would recommend game lot fun especially friends someone doesnt see game rosetinted glasses agree negative reviewslevel via artifacts even got didnt level bring back exp system tremendously improved game doesnt quick levels way get stronger along gear progression regionregion locking gear effective region made dont know rest players dont like starting essentially new game every time wanna go somewhere else especially since takes hours somewhat threateningchanging even one improve game play almost infinite amount someone apart ride since say game nothing anticipated starting slow thats bad game like issue comes think start scratch immediately cross another region happened borders reward finishing regions movement speed something else minimal theres point finishing zones start scratch time move quicker exploration feels like ripped game sure fun run around see see thats youre set region whilst youre gearing feel like youre locked inside certain region last thing would want cross border isnt exploration rpg supposed exploring took game completely wrong direction im happy see also word wollay day whilst trying hype twitter disgusting someone account since alpha simply cannot enjoy game current state region locked equipment even mobility gear glider removes fun exploring amazing world someone played alpha actually less enjoyable alpha dont know happened isnt fun boring alpha great progression loop youd grind get better gear youre basically beating game different biome pet health random shit like someone played alpha someone played video games general please buy game fix itimagine world cant level mobs stronger youand theyre lot lurking ready gang bang soon get within range oh boy mage enemy ranged ability get ready get sent back last resurrection statue lets say survive long enough find village get ore make gear stronger nowyes able take mildly stronger monsters long fight one potions youve crafted able heal warriors shoutassuming changed class guardian running around etching quick hits praying dont aggro another enemy realize youre really much stronger go back fighting weaker enemies find god tier weapon oh man everything better one shot everything eh oh well least make progress right right lets explore map find even harder enemies fightnow youre reach edge region awaits endlessly vast game region locked gear region locked gear whats mean huh well gear found upgrades key upgrades gliders boats reigns climbing claws everything gone back hours nothing matters one bit new regionthis game punishes exploring reason fight enemies doesnt get anything money youre lucky good weapon class didnt get lucky enough fighting terriers sheep get class weapon thats overpowered one shot weapon everything going stomp even try get stronger progress removed every time go new region game gives absolutely goals imagine every rpg game youve ever played resetting progress every time go new town thats cube world gotta fix game better changes someone played alpha religiously must say full release game feels unrewarding ways unplayable dev team abandoned community work passion project feeling means unfortunately wont care feedback receiving game punishes exploring taking items away every time enter new region nerfing armor weapons hp damage state reflecting first time loading instead gaining experience leveling exploring regions higher level enemies get reset every time explore takes away desire explore especially movement travel items taken away new regions desire play game progress immediately eliminated want see world spawned problem xp equipment system alpha wish stuck understand wanted try something new unique personal game opinion formula one many people would say worth year waiti cant recommend game current state loved alpha like release feels disappointing could go back alpha still access someone played alpha definite downgrade key features iremovedi final version things tweeted saying working icompleted themi completely absent final version wanted second run cash grab closing websites shop years ago letting us get excited dont waste money someone watched alpha never played really enjoying game understand criticism gets yes grindy guess thats part charm loving legend zelda links awakening style collecting different tools musical instruments help along way excited finally get game let think long go open mind understand game alpha build change drastically enjoy bought game onsale think thats great pricepoint game definitely worth bucks usually retails hold buying id wait till onsale someone whos played since release alpha literally month alpha dropped version game despite major difference still really fun opinion mechanics different normally see openworld rpgs admit starting difficult could get smoked bee soon jump get hang things really enjoyable theres always stuff would love see big updates game game goes alpha beta feels though less content game mechanics refined class skills unique balanced remapped different buttons however lack skill tree ruins lot fun game map fog unexplored places gone desire explore new areas due knowing next region store addition instruments plus find give optional gear loot lose next region lot people would prefer skip alpha players feels lot like slap face already experienced fun exploring world wollay made alpha one big dungeon per region doesnt help alpha players used exploring many harder dungeons stuff like spike traps finding much changed beta release one week later quite disappointing would give game shot id recommend new players preferably friends going exploring region unique pets terrain generation worthwhile experience try returning players youre missing much best wait wollay update game even game right simply cannot recommend dont disagree region locking way executed new cubeworld build clunky best downright irritating others feel small changes could recommend game changes implemented right simply cannot game lot potential please write good change hopefully game right dont buy wait updates lets hope going another one game stands dont recommend people buy buy game reading youll see im talking game stands right recommend game compared several years ago versions game play disgusting much alpha either removed altered mind numbingly boring hard even play game couple hours region spawn fun explore every inch region work way good equipment maybe even catch pet two get region artifact move next region realise things one gear worthless forcing start effectively scratch two artifacts grant character useless bonuses ie swim speed little effect game play three game tells level completing region nothing character stat boosts new skills nothing forth youve completed region youve pretty much done everything game besides unique dungeons rarely spawn mean go see new biomes landscapes really isnt anything else thus giving little reason venture starting region much love cube world much want see full potential game cant recommend anyone right first didnt like play sense starts make fun istips sleep inn refreshes map aka quests mobs drops themtalk every npc items really annoying find tell whereyou look world map really zoomed locate geographical oddities normally questsitemsloreonce complete first zone get artifact gear starts dropping things gain value potions werent using become useful start new zone monsters quests completed zone worth potential gear end cycling daily looking gear explore new zone till sleep repeat enjoy combat item huntingcollecting im better fighting monsters general started even though gear resets new zone slow get faster find gear still hunt perfect piece gear rare enough keep busy find artifacts character gains passive boosts make exploring faster time complete zones youll litter quests choose repeat daily search gear perfect game even game years ago kind refreshing play something feels different though gradually getting fun play first going rail game found coming back want play cute game great feedback base game loops said still major flaws lots minor go things liked gameprosgood gameplay fun move world use abilitiescertain sounds eg drops pickup attack sounds musiccertain biomes eg desert biome jungle biomes beautiful work wellthe basic progression loop relatively satisfyingcombat get skilled play top new gear impossible enemies easynow pretty solid pros game needs fundamental changes im going play already lets start minorminor conswater sounds extremely poor quality much swimming ocean biomes sound nicerfootstep sounds repetitive change material youre onlosing boat glider reins every zone little annoying would far didnt money use flight masters constantly said losing items perzone would totally fine even welcome adds good gameplay conquering zonewater look odd sometimesclouds weird looking repetitive lowbiomes intense heat able spawn next biomes intense coldall biomes need far rock tree diversitybeing water muffle noises music etcthe new potion crafting essentially useless think drank damage potion oncecharacter creation subpar game allows place single blocks weapon customize itnow meat potatoes major consmajor consquests zone summed getting key itemsagain saving gnomesagainthe curve power far extreme go hitting zone hitting legendariesafter conquering one zone become godlike least warrior take legendary mobs come top little effort leads easy gold farming day sleep night rinse repeatthe gem trader gnomes useless remember respawns ore deposits case knew diamond ore spots farmed day diamonds top huge iron ore areas making legendaries becomes jokegear gear get works adjacent zones really broken exist case two legendary items shield chestpiece makes adjacent zones absolute joke gear become useless entering adjacent zone rather decrease stats every number zones youve traveled original isnt preset gear option current zone change mountains gear manually every timethere isnt main story really sink conquer long time rather theres artifact locations uncover add small bonuses semiuseless things like hang gliding speed boat speed etc arent useless hey lets real feel useless especially teleport shrine near town well fly needs big main randomly generated enemy certain continents point game could conquer every randomly generated zone randomly generated continent beat randomly generated big daddy boss fight randomly generated mechanics right everything feels useless like nothing say randomly generated enough concludes thoughts feelings cube world thanks reading first quite difficult game really enjoyed get hang basically finished game isnt much get hours game play depending fast learnhow much die really isnt end game cant really show youve achievedfound also played alpha thus got beta free beta quite different alpha good way theres bugs game runs well finished product worth current state first game seemed extremely fun creative buying starting play also seems fun completing everything one biome area decide move next basically start gear previous area gained worthless doesnt work new area time go new area begin anew simply fun anymore reccomend buy unless theres sinificant update definetly worth price experience also glitchy doesnt feel like complete game core fun pick put game play much youll get burnt quickly likely wont enjoy least move tiny investment made years ago judge game today like adult fun game pass time alone friends least hype fun weekgood luck next time wollay least gave free us bought hype alpha thats say game developers nowadays props unfortunately game fails even worse live hype lots potential fun yet barebones gameplay scrapped new arguably worse system progression difficulty starting area hard easy everywhere else game enemies seem random spawned levels rather alphas method easy enemies spawn progressively difficult progress outward never really truly progress either alpha looting find good items grinding powerful could weird system region locked items never get true sense progression core gameplay still enjoyable however seriously crippled flaws outlined im gonna say buy developer likely come back game shame current stage grind way way much recommend current state game cant recommend game one big reason progression system played game week alpha players got game one week early dont think havent given game fair gothe game changed significantly alpha many reviews tell removal exp itembased progression region locked gear removal skill trees gear etc changes overall feel game different shock many alpha players game changed one massive grind many different smaller grinds region zone map feeling like new game plus similar prestige system seen many clicker games reset gain slightly power next completion concept resetbased progression system need find artefacts permanent upgrades actually good encourages player explore regions fully interact villages find artefacts however artefacts arent goodthe artefacts moment provide small noncombat buffs example riding speed increase light radius provided lamp isnt enough encouragement continue playing players perspective never truly feel like getting stronger core aspect rpg instead feeling like every time completed region worth slightly stronger feels like enter new region made new character losing progress effort put small noncombat buffs dont feel like worth artefacts need changed include combat buffs damage crit attack speed hp etc dont big buffs least feels worth effort put completing entire region understand break balance late game variety added noncombat buffs kept take long time reach point region takes around hours depending size easily achievable believe significantly help improve progression system keeping many players engaged strive become stronger addition still retain feeling game wollay wants well cant wont hope modding community games current state grind isnt rewarding enough many othersconclusionif looking full release alpha content disappointed matter whatif openminded alpha cube world changing still cant recommend iti cant recommend game anyone looking short game maybe hours play friends progression system doesnt
