select play alphaas nothing wouldnt recomend content full glitches bugs make game unplayable alpha content feels like alpha real alpha beta cant play textures waiting nobody seems care fans disappointed dont buy start seeing changes wouldnt recommend buying developer vocal future game wouldnt recommend right nowit lost fun thingsaka mostly leveling region lock added whytake feedback

moving new region defeats purpose open world point exploring world entering new region strip hard work least beta explore world leisure final product upgrade wow disappointmentimagine spineless make people pay alpha barely update years lie twitter didcome saying youre officially releasing b somehow still less features alpha years ago bwhy region locking remove skill tree remove exp level system know whybecause couldnt assd worry carefully balancing difficulty throughout game didnt want players reaching point powerful instead removed features matter good player much time spent getting loot completing whole area started back afterwards way wouldnt deal difficulty curve rightyoud better another forgotten developer greedy werent kids grew watching youtubers play cube world hit adulthood probably bank account nowid say youre like yandere dev least yandere devs alpha free loose stuffs need stuffs play games become god story game game doesnt either yes know unsure buying enjoy game cannot recommend masses hear outi really wanted recommend game really theres much missing balance horrible imho said still enjoyable play gamethis game alot fun look past gear turning useless upon entering new losing items help exploring upon entering new xp bar sort character customization affects dying enemy higher current gear tier unless know ways games permanent progression exploration stats eg consume less stamina look guide figuring everything cause game doesnt explain basically everything without big changes gameplaythat said good things game opinion alot bad onesthe game adorable artstyle amazing music running around things feels somewhat good see landscapes combat mechanics feel pretty smooth balance read negativestheres alot alot mention variety negativesyou always find challenge seek oneyou pet animals cute tame almost animal see also cute pogmultiplayer playing friends always alot fun loot based per region progression system youll find better gear chance mobs defeating bosses completing quests said gear gets locked certain region kingdom gear locked kingdoms makes usable adjacent regions information available gathered npcs towns adventurers around map game still bugs devs working theseeverything except artifacts find region belongs region usable region exception gear includes means traverse world faster items access secretsartifacts give small bonuses

dont think fair comparison didnt like get refund still enjoyed yeah abandonware move along find better game yeah pretty good takes get rollinga tutorial world system would go long long wayi hated first picked chill game jump small burstwould reccommend reading steam guides yeah playtime low theres number reasons including dropping windows support requiring jiggering play simply interested game becomei purchased game based product yearss ago roadmap supplied continued action rpg road really liked look really enjoyed alpha shelved since expected updates come didnt want burn nothing happened years cut january year developer put another little bit information come every months game still moving towards roadmap outlinedagain cut ahead months land announcement game actually released excited looked deeper found game nearly every feature stripped barebones quasirpg true progression procedural worlds skill trees unimpressed community surrounding itim going make politics happened say game liked cannot recommend find plenty information happened changed elsewhere doubt seen already youre read far check back future see game returned roots currently looking like threw money away yeah nothis game brutal difficulty isnt necessarily bad thing cube world makes bad think favorite hard games whether something like dark souls roguelite like binding isaac time fight enemy die learn mistakes whether dodging playing defensive finding openings attackscube world teaches fight enemies would expect giant rock monster annihilate soon start game everything said rock monsters tiny snails kill hits doesnt matter much try dodge focus attacks die respawnnaturally playing game almost hour decided search internet believed playing game wrong found interesting things make never want touch game cant reasonably attack monsters get better weapon find randomly world rare item drops means isnt tactics use get upper hand combat rather need good game isnt based procedural generation promised years ago instead everyone starts world spawns different world split zones leave zone another one items turned starter gear game wants complete tasks inside zone get feeling completion moving onto next zone starting completely ruins idea exploration limits confined area ready start scratchi know play game another hour still get refund cant bare hard know someones passion project really isnt honestly dont think lot people year old excited eventually play game year old cannot find fun inside yeah played back day super excited see worked im gonna wait years see gets unscrewed yeah games kind garbage release wouldnt recommend buying dev decides stop radio silent makes empty game less empty game lacking starbound theres obviously issue yeah sorry wollay youve done game alpha worth money allif possible refund game game isnt going give sense accomplishment due region lock yeah enjoy game years ago friend group got together blasted music explored cube world together lan party helped explore level couldnt wait get together play againyears later cubeworld beta released understand game still beta seems like less beta alpha everytime load game try play minutes close game use love feels worse every corner take die get sent back spot take long walk back fact skill tree removed ruins progression currently gain progression artifacts however gear turns mush go another region problems fixed creator mods give game negitive review isnt fun hope one day feel confident enough game rebuy play yes recommend game definitely everybodys cup tea grindy game gear region locked except gear carries neighboring regions mechanic starting every single region kinda scared first got playing makes sense needed add longevity game without would still use old overpowered gear itd almost alpha another thing believe could worked artifact system get artifact gives tiny bonus movement abilities diminishing returns like desperately needs improved upon doesnt seem impactful future id like see affect stats well allowing actual permanent character progression aside movement abilities love game need look right mindset action rpg rogue like elements resetting new areas keeping couple things yes know people desagree im sure devs update game bad ways mods btw fun time playing little repetitive yes drawbacks whatever still much enjoyable especially friendsand still faith devs recommend yes progression explorationgear based experience based yes gear special abilities region locked thats point game fun land repeats next experience different new biome everything plays

collecting andor braking game way ppl wants clear world mapgod speed great game amazing soundtrack voxel graphics think look detailed outstanding concern game im sure may heard whether like style progression compared alpha progress style completely scrapped progression vertical horizontal words climb top fall back bottom continue game map huge completing region two youll mostly find playing game anymore however beating regions takes long time satisfying say least design changes wouldnt made still recommend game regardless lot fun verdict game lot fun worth spending money design changes could made better reward player terms progression see wollay continues supporting game adding content got steam key felt amazing knowing play beautiful game againafter playing h feel empty even alpha much options worldin current state cant recommend title spoiler download alpha spoiler cube world game played back alpha fun game opinion criticisms others ignored theyre valid games progression system fun good slightest leave region start cannot use items youve picked like glider climbing spikes gears power reduced point useless regionlocking terrible idea havent played starting region enough say like start new region gear removal exp skill trees sad see trees actually pretty interesting level collecting artifacts sounds weird ill touch later lack tutorial bad idea seems like lack outside play testing entire game feels like played tested one person probably considering wollay developer prefers keep work finished says played game alpha even clue progress looked steam guide useful guide recommend using even think know whole lore artifact system really isnt fun im still first region keep finding lore regions region really damn annoying deal getting feels like grind artifact havent gotten yet feels like chore get well need staryellow gear even think approaching area artifact kept ive played almost hours writing review still havent gotten gear except chestplate star level one observation correct im wrong feels like wasnt much new content added game systems entirely reworked six years wollay went mia cant seem pick anything really new added minus lore artifacts thats pretty troubling think might seem like doom gloom modern cube world theres quite things found enjoyableloved new cube world even theyre mostly also games alpha game feels polished ive encountered bugs ive noticed game saving windowed resolution upon startup game combat simple yet personally enjoy doesnt feel like need super skilled fight overly complex bit simple love music much game whimsical fills feeling wanting see games pretty world graphics simple dont need amazing art direction game nice love colors used designs playable playable really odd races creatures voxelbased design might make seem like nothing minecraft clone nothing really even similar minecraft game also never drops frames thats surprising since mid highrange pc mileage may varylike said beginning lot fun playing game far even wasnt game expecting play typically play openworld games beating area moving onto next anyway regionlocking items awful idea hope wollay changes future feel like game shouldve worked bit fresh content added well game lot potential would shame see abandoned since game hit finally even though really doesnt feel like im going give game positive review hopes game becoming better hopefully removal regionlocking reintroduction skill trees old leveling system disappointing outcome game great world open world rpg explore region find craft equipment power fight stronger enemies ultimate treasure artifacts discover voxel game art style seems unique charm runs well aging pc despite voxel aesthetics building game customise look weapons editing modelsat start game choose classes warrior mage rogue ranger class two variants switch later game give different abilities skillset class fairly limited rather distinctivethe world procedurally generated theres fairly decent selection biomes within one makes region theres also villages find npcs workbenches craft items equipment also find friendly npcs roaming around time time talking npc give hints certain items another mechanic pets tame fight ridea premise sets fantastic foundation build solid game upon sadly foundation get cube world ill get thing note enemies equipment colour coded tier kill hostile mob usually get little bit gold occasionally piece equipment tier mob killed gold spent shops buy items equipmentwhen first start enemies kill quickly even cows give hard time however cheesed bringing friendly npcs fight really one strategies use early rely rng get stronger getting better equipment way thats going happen dont get experience points game problem stats dramatic effect cube world want kill stronger enemy find strong npc let get lucky get powerful piece equipment hopefully matches class equipped massive effect combat ability go damage steamrolling multiple enemies like nothing go two shot becoming virtually invincible enemies one item change things quickly next granularity progression feels unfair reliant luck npcs work rather skill doesnt feel satisfying become powerfulthe fights quite simple still good thing fight tactically however enemy attacks difficult impossible dodge usually end trading blows unless cheese enemy ai snipe range moving aggro doesnt feel like theres skill involved however fight even toppling powerful enemies feels unsatisfying way around region usually going various points interest take time get one place another obtaining boat hang glider speed things travelling still takes majority game time fine theres lot things way world feels empty lifeless occasionally might find ore deposits hidden loot vast majority time running across fields nothing get b fast travel thing game everything spread still takes get somewhere nearest spawn pointthe points interests usually contain small dungeon boss need kill bosses act like slightly stronger versions regular enemies quests rewarding though get guaranteed drop tier location also hard reach places contain either gold special items boat hang glider help traverse region faster get previously inaccessible locationsfinally also large dungeons tend difficult places region also house artifact give permanent increase certain noncombat stats elephant room poor balance makes really janky experience comes powering region youve completed region go well obvious answer would move next region keep going world basically endless procedurally generated could go wrongas soon enter different region gear region becomes grey tier lowest tier boat instantly disappears hang glider vanishes thin air reins go poof get picture revisit region found items get back regain tier well however means complete new region need start scratchnow isnt necessarily bad system roguelikes tend use example really successful whats wrong cube world answer lies variety start scratch expect play different game every time perhaps enemies different environment different items get different gameplay dramatically changed new combination keeps replayability factor interest game cube world none youve explored one region youve explored item drops dont change way play game occasionally may tanky glass cannon thats differentiating factor every dungeon basically last one looking cosmetically different enemies fight exactly way basically playing exact game new region explore trying find decent equipment region awkward way longevity cube world far biggest flawthose artifacts yeah marginally increase stats generally unimportant increase swimming speed go find boat slightly faster basically dont matter next impact repetitive nature game world felt decent enough first region despite balance issues long travel time highlights id say talking npcs give quests locations items find made first couple hours fun became apparent game first region learning every region afterwards would play exactly way incentive continue playingits shame cube world potential much desperately needs content game basically everything randomly generated absolutely needs much variety keep things interesting however right depth puddle given track record developers highly doubt ever changewhich leads final question cube world worth money quarter price id give slack least enjoyment game however currently stands answer resounding disappointed cube world back picromas site years back time game typical levelingskill progression elements ton outside leveling showed massive potential sadly updates stopped rolling alpha build developer didnt update game little half decadeso presented official release cube world longer alpha buildcube world better areas regarding locations quests worse progression arguably hours total due regions pregenerated map locking gear region three gear made work multiple regions youre always encouraged regear keep ability keep exploring without reverted square one beyond repetitive gameplay loop youre rewarded slight permanent noncombat buffs character within region would think would aid clearing zones even faster truth youll need clear numerous zones seeing speed benefits youre looking gain less per boost get youll still need keep obtaining certain mobility tools theyre something truly keep goodthe release build feels like side grade alpha implies endless potential replayability traditional leveling systems games elsewhere really see small amount content offer without massive grind found alpha build bcube world may always game limitless potential b world full complete start things easy simple answers im gonna judging crap game merits certain things ive privy towards alpha player understanding used changed added taken away ive even returned alpha help review wont predominately negative review end day im still judging represented displayed us good first thing note try give sense big expansive world full things giving us semidestructive environment foliage destroyed attacks weapon enemies certain areas like snow thick covered areas cleared attacks thats always something see animals enemies even giving pets choose taming although still big number think still somethingtheyve upgraded mages wand laser attack amazing feature love something ive grown heavily rely fire mage provided much entertainment slaughtered many foes minimal effort compared alpha fireballwaterball attack fling much hate got rid skill progression tree help fire mages giving us better alternative attack flame salvo attack instead close range explosion three meteors caster flings air still good aoe remarkable damage hitwater effects much better release certain noises much better ill even give dungeons better release traps alpha felt rather useless existing without purpose release theres pitfalls lava pits little platforms need navigate jumping fighting better regards ive played mage really reference stand bynow way something shared alpha cube world general whole extremely unfriendly new players arent used controls game never knew dodge much less teleporting option betarelease help feature came even things like quests certain areas game locked certain items unlock needs friendlier method inform players go next thats questing journals tend thing either make people naturally gravitate towards itemsmind becomes less problem learn things harsh lesson give new players good way drive away potential ones staying good frustration motivates someone keep going theres bad frustration shuts desire keep goinganother problem lack resources cant get stronger leveling need rely gear weaponry main method better yet three methods acquisition list weaponarmor shops improved gnome rescue missions crafting improved defeating special bosses crafting books random drops gear similar color tends fall enemies like colors exception miniboss enemies scale one higher listand shops arent guaranteed every item random assortments items usually two color maybe youre lucky less though crafting reliable method rare circumstances actually chance craft gear work region youre along neighboring lands adjacent land made thats still extremely rare usually youre grinding constantly get right pieces able clear areas leave region run region locking main issue lot people game another problem course fact unlocks specific region well list upgrades crafting recipe books upgrades shops gnomes hang glider boats climbing boots reinslistthe methods unlocked tends matter go saving one gnome pretty much understand going play go every single time difficulty youre fighting different thing really carries artifacts boosts effects climbing swimming similar things theyre way level doesnt really give much benefit long run one thing tried multiplayer horrible lag nightmarish wasnt playable didnt want go watching monsters running like trying reenact something benny hill show liked alpha version much problems release things like flaws understand game released flaws still active full display world see feels incomplete everything pulled alpha halfbaked could much want see much better anyone asks worth buying isnt dont buy unless want halffinished product still problems

communicate communityi repeat waste money game get game comments listed good reasons garbage region locking butchered gameplay loop general lack content valid thats worst theres even guarantee youll able play game purchased bought full price launched ive waiting since alpha cant run game got play hours interesting game takes long get going people go hour limit refund realize garbage crashed wouldnt open ever day cant run garbage heap computer isnt beastly gaming machine definitely capable running games like even better ones crashes black immediately every launch game dev ran money like weasel updates fixing almost guarantee hasnt touched since launch even think ignore region lock garbage general watering get game theres decent chance wont even let run randomly one day restarted computer uninstalled cleaned folder reinstalled anyone wonders even fresh install tried vain attempt cant launch maybe money blow game cant even run someone whos broke shit disappointing waste money youre gonna sell trash game least let run said trash game complete let wish steam would remove farce game recommend casual gamers want bit quick easy looked forward finally try cube word hopes high loved pictures small videos ive seen years never tried alpha idea used state right recommend casual gamers want bit quick easy fun went died second never figured maybe im adventures enough ive say person working professional uxui everyday game illustrates lot things really want say something good short experience game thing guess reason ive looking forward try graphics really pretty eye game future game changes road better update reviewi see wollay coming region locking gear removal xp seems decent concept right poorly implemented kinda discourages exploring different regions going different region almost different creating new character doesnt feel like im progressing character besides major issue game decently fun see getting bit dry maybe hours play keep eye game interested right cannot recommend charm years ago honestly really saddens mealso ton cool teased features like castles big cities quest lines playable races etc seem removed game loopbuonly played hours havent gotten everything first region yet cant speak much crafting doesnt seem worthwhile outright find better gear laying around craft saving long timei love gear skill rather artificially inflated numbers friends farm bunch exp play gear gets better different abilities still ubcharacter designbupositivei love gear skill rather artificially inflated numbers friends farm bunch exp play gear gets better

best ubsounds musicbupositiveive really enjoyed sounds music game far understand whats happening things supposed sounds music masterpiece noticable enough remember enjoy themonly sound issue ive game starting sound music volume extremely loud ended taking able regain hearing like game fun bought alpha way back first released picroma site played alpha time betas release sometimes alone solo times group friends manually shared copy fun week dropped next several months new fresh run started morehonestly would probably version loads fun september first hit made solo character frog ranger named flipper basically played game game next days like last several runs alpha prior dropped game felt fun play started something else agree game flaws systems dont think way bad guess go opinion im nothing person interested game design yet dont think ill ever see making anything note worthy list gear progression system actually liked xp counterpart grinding xp next skill points fun yes alpha character skills mobility skills level dont see grinding mindlessly next skill point start almost hell levels difficult basically naked white gear found green weapon game instantly became much enjoyable complaint crafting green weapon fine anything blue rarity gear crazy expensive time consuming obtain making crafting essentially worse option maybe missed crazy amount resources adventure region locking interesting effectively plays difficulty scaling game dont hit power cap first hours game served purpose well felt kind rouge like without dying part liked course think removing different mechanic would better option reworking one idea wish could play around zelda botw style durability weapons maybe change drop rates lower tier common high yellow tier elusively rare maybe hard quest rewards would make play multiple weapons keep hand full different situations honestly like idea much also remove mobility items like boat reins hang glider honestly idea fix besides one done seems easy reducing energy cost boring bandaid fix imo artifacts replacing xp leveling system something like although dislike lack way tell character actually skills bringing back class buildings would probably warrant world wipe make due new town generating true world predetermined npc act teacher guide tells class would extremely helpful back artifacts like fun collecting dont like current given stats seem unnecessary maybe letting player choose stat would better non combat ones though honestly thats really got listtheirs would like talk feel rest qol stuff would like things work currently though really enjoy game regret buying alpha years back im glad wollay put another version pleased wollay continues working game cool think id still find fun ever version releases fun game eyes plan playing itedit trying format make look nicer im used writing reviews new biomes structures compared alphanew enemies bosses tamable animals compared alphathe steam multiplayer integration smooth overall functioning combat fun sometimes especially boss tutorial exploration based gameplay loop removes everything need explore change biomesarea boats hang gliders riding pets bound

clearly highlighted map current biome even hadnt discovered yet gave player general direction first load world remove content find quests talking random npcs towns everyone quest lot npcs towns results talk every single npc town order find quests alpha npcs quest would marked exclamation mark heads remove content already multiplayer party status hud removed even though alpha given quest sometimes quest marker location highlighted map sometimes wont worldgen completely changed longer use seeds like alpha build many content snapshots shown wollays lead developer twitter completely missing stripped lot function see today listthe gameloop focused around exploring collecting artefacts level game contradicts essentially forcing players back stage want explore taking away players equipment giving enough incentive player actually pursue artefacts regions due lackluster rewards fundamentally hurts game creating boring core game experience ultimately leaves player feeling aimless personally led stop playing zero reason play current formits important note game seems content mechanics found alpha stripped away well content saw wollay reveal throughout years development found twitter feed dont understand allthis game currently fun play personally expected years development kinda zone takes hours beat move next zone start lose boat glider armorweapons enough verity justify resetting progresslisti would consider ok kept items much larger area play beat single zone reason keep playing outside seeing new zones completing entire zone give player one piece gear good zones scratch system generated lore put something worth trying read would give reason find lore keep adding new bioms lore keep coming back listjust cents years recommend cube world unique rpg isnt one anymore unique exploration game fun rewards leaving single stone unturnedblots backlash alpha rpg styled one exploration focused really downgrade different take worth enjoy lot exploration focused games cube world remains great timeironically people complain still access alpha fine theyd rather even clearly prefer muchquotethanosas long remember always unable accept quote madman carry apples want carry moreyou foolyou dumbothe game different back apples liked itthis game dissapointmentthis game masterpiece bye bye world world cubes problem cube matter side look falls write longer detailed review later short game isnt worth time money doesnt matter bought game years ago back alpha released list promises weirdly enough looking game full release today game worth buying opinionthe game open procedurally generated supposedly endless world yet gates world regions soft barriers gear weapons armour degrades essentially starting gear cross region border unless farm good gear complete quests zone unlock ability farm good gear symbol travel region without stuff degrading againthere xp leveling system stats determined gear level eventually find legendary gear persists across regions kingdom without degrading itll degrade soon enter another kingdom game doesnt vary things combat simplistic theres xp reason fight mobs littered throughout world unless want tiny bit gold odd crafting itemcrafting gear mostly pointless obtaining new gear isnt rewarding stumble quests really map markers unlocked spamming use key every npc encounter find unmarked npcs give quest markers maptheres nothing interesting keep playing skill trees new abilities mix things theres strategy combat simplistic need better gear take mobs game actually game dump new character middle area completely surrounded hostile mobs take hits theres tutorials little explained game reward understanding everything boring gameif enjoy spamming e bunch random friendly npcs spending ages walking map markers putting new gear repeat process forever maybe youll great time could also pull weeds garden bare hands though id much rather quotearcane raise long development final result huge disappointment would expect finished product polished gameplay many features keep dreaming quote bit rough around edges still crazy fun challenging experience flawed game doubt personally find good time game different alpha still combat old cube world little different fun game play wait years development game improved somewhat game still bland lacks content developer comes back second mia adds content would recommend game current unfinished content less state cant years game barely got better years disappointment really fun hard hours game playing first build awesome best played friends games could use

everything good rpg needs bosses cool equipment infinite world difficulty scaling solid multiplayer well comes overhauled version already great alpha filled everything loved new combos enemies dungeons everything game got massive boost turned great game quite different rpgs great cube world one problem alpha skill tree exp system levels completely gone abilities readily available makes game different games also kind ruins whole point game feel useless leveling xp grind makes alot game pointless painful leveling region get artifact increases riding speed bring back xp level skill tree game could even better good without yes bad without could much better system like alpha version point running around getting better gear game currently stands enjoy minutes everything feels useless

hours gameplay would recommend playing friend found different classes really go well together ranger warrior work amazinglyi really complaints boat hang glider controls really hard use anything going forward especially apparent hang glider one wrong button press sent spiral towards ground impossible escape times count half special items seem one use regions usually uses good meanwhile special items seem required reigns boat required want travel long distances quicklyoverall think theres issues rest game really funi one request small change though make clouds solid found way get one fazed dont even care theres anything would cool walk around high different form alpha many ways several good yes essentialy restart area unless aquire specific type gear neighboring area game gives something strive alpha hit lvl pieces legendary gear almost invincible nice able continue character still able challenge instead total domination hours play time wish would bump green gear instead worthless legendthe new hang glider system stinks though different alpha still fun imo different bad fee quirks need fixing fun disappointing current state many things promised either removed never

really loved game alpha however cant recommend game good game good wow game fun idk else say game good lol game poorly optimized im spending solid minute waiting terrain generate fog surrounds time dissipate ive played alpha bit im sad runs better supposedtobepolished versionmaybe better people proper gaming setups proper release better possibly earliest available versionnot mention multitude complaints youve already probably seen negative reviews fog war makes exploration pointless items regionlocked forces effectively start anew every biome yadda yaddai recommend pirating alpha though pretty fun game solid base work build become amazing rpg game disappointing original game like years ago better game ruined better back game sucks removed everything alpha made fun game good game good steam pepelaugh game really good broken website alpha steam version vastly change mechanics overall gameplay better alot worse like alpha went dead years steam version seems following suit little contact patches since launch client coop ok plagued issues game zone gear limited quests overall gameplay give enough revived long term simply much messperhaps another stint years get another update cw overall right either buy game mess around friends coop alpha really worth buying form right much feeling like placeholder unfinished game much better multiplayer whole world didnt restart every region games pretty fun walk minuts direction progress gets reset generally direction game went well item based progression nice artifactleveling system kind good made levels seem insignificant extremely slow caught gear region lock everything would fine werent region locking opinion thats likely others think well lots fun first hours played friends got new region became extremely shitty due region locking gear system making everything wearing tools got previous region useless old cube world extremely fun despite repetitive new region lock gear extremely bad id recommend friends system punishes exploration game explore get mods makes everything whole lot better glad finally getting attention worth bucks love little gem bought years ago cheap worth right go pirate alpha better shit go alpha better experience good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good nostalgic game good combat gear gets downgraded massively good fun peps never played alpha good game good game good game good game good game good game good game like new progression system little bit raw around edges lots fun like hard games loads people crying lack lvls crab able kill like play easy games play metin grinding easy mobs hours gametldrgame cookie clicker fans good game although perfect would recommend good game needs little updates good game dont listen hater good game play mods good game nuff said good game needs work good game play friends real grind area area use mods good game play friends alone good game say good game playing areas get mod remove area locked items good game bit far feel everyone wanted good gamebit grindy becomes repetitive game still good game play friends good game mods turn region lock good imo wait sale good need work though good stuf good thing paid worth turkish dollars good basically restart game good mod yees good hope keep getting updated got like thousands hours alpha come alpha better actuall full release game tragic garbage got game year came early alpha clear devs completely abandoned pretty fun theres much content thing cause pretty much still alpha gamei wouldnt pay great example game didnt live hype worse could still pretty fun time waster great sorta thoughts head empty adventure gamelots people bash gear doesnt carry regions thats really problem opinion fact loot doesnt carry means theres real end goal game doesnt work linear story based game isnt one keep coming back every days bit fun great game great game great game great game great game great game great game played years ago first came still enjoy playing great game mod great game lots fun frustrating great game great game tons fun great game really enjoyed eve slow computer great graphics amazing immersion owl hoots dark great mate would rate greatest come back history better karate kid lot fun playing multiplayer going blindly never played alpha beta haha free reward haha free reward haha know would crazy added xp skill tree system jk jk unless alot potential like change loot region locked well removal level progression mostly sure done update review either things change alpha tested ive blast purely better version game hi used watch cube world youtube finnally got chance play although game dosent quite stand upto likes origanal gameplay saw youtube stand true see tbh still good inspires finnish area instead rushing functionality like awesome rpg expeirence id definatly still recomend game must hold hold recommend theres couple really controversial systems might alienate firstthe game locks gear specific region drops gear region surrounding regions honestly first heard thought stupid played stopped feeling like dont get wrong problems around notably around crafting materials actually enjoy meant serve gameplay loop replacing subtle oh youre high level use cool glowing sword anymore better use higher level shitty blue sword instead well quicker mountains harsher valleyssadly imo region locking also applies special items stuff like reins letting ride pet glider self explanatory sky flute summons birds specific locations lift floating islands etcgrindy af good kind grindyfeatures missingartifacts one driving forces incentivise move regions lacklustre affect movement abilities taken away region suffer diminishing returns even first one pick doesnt feel massively impactfuldevs person team active beta fixing bugs im quietly optimistic future relevant game went alpha six years ago well community overwhelmed two alpha got like two bug fixes honestly enjoy playing game wish stuff alpha wish gear wasnt regionlocked youre interested wait sale honestly fun like hours yeah thats iti feel like system could work actual progression honestly rn worth buying theres many flaws grind experience feel rewarding especially considering amount time takes u spend first hour every new zone becoming competant enough survive basic mobs running around avoiding combat say redeeming quality game everything one hit u mention classes specifically warrior flawed bugged honestly alpha much potential way exp system completely removed completely removes sense progression one wish would built game alpha kept good thingsexp system class tree randomly generated terrain seems got rid games good qualities attempted improve bad things honestly disappointing used play alpha back forth till loot rewarding back stats equipment stayed throughout game didnt spend hours get good enough equipment one region find artifact insignificantly increases climbing time get reset go next regionquests left completely unsatisfying painstakingly realise every good item youve toiled get utterly useless next region making progress fruitless endeavour ponder reason still playing game bullying thinking made sort advancement honestly game way better alpha even region lock thing equipement since longer probleme understand game work relics fun spirit bell song favorite part certainly add gameplay killing bosses manageable alpha killing large group weaker enemies fantastic downside think multiplayer system probleme like want start game friend spawn another region hell find equipements region play youll give yourselfmy conclusion game greatly improved nearly domain good adventure exploration game hope upgrade game uwu love cube world disappointed new update cant get xp multiplayer via steam sucks friend spawn miles away cant reach friend world singleplayer love game fixed multiplayer spawn friend absolutely love game dont understand people give much hate acualy loved alpha leveling system everything else awsome relics leveling bad idea keep relics add leveling system well think game might explode love good time playing game may hard u play u enjoy

badly didnt get chance play back looked interesting enchanting played hours ok best wont even start without crashingwhat went wrong october deleted blog disappeared weve bamboozled boys wanted like game whas looking forward however disappointed everything good cube world first hours linked back alpha thought development years least half problems alpha version would fixed arenttrying explore world punish gear spent time getting used region try go new region like starting new character avoided though exploring world staying region spawn thats fun way mention skill treeprogression system main way progressing region gearim sure good things game later however would much better buy game spend money something else good experience top bottom doesnt need hours playing minimum get anywhere considering right think take alot longer two hours get decent gear part alpha testing high hopes upon hearing cube world finally coming years amazing thought dead done projectlittle know store would make wish stayed dead happy memoryupon first creating new character quickly discovered mob touch capability kill hits instantly ok change weapons thing find slimes theyre always easy end dying hits upon respawn still aggroed followed straight back respawn killed toofinally giving made new character new world different yet slightestok lets go discussions maybe theres issue strong mobs literally right next spawn point every single direction explanation theres plenty people complaining whats changed gear progression catalyst combat game guess start straight zero go beyond regions borders start instances dungeons cross regions screw region completion boss beyond line youll flying sailing whoops crossed threshold use glider boat anymore many glaring issues anyone point wait release maybe issue impossible mobs right next spawn stop issue nope make brand new character literally every single direction rank higher shot dare come close hightail run past looking town tip youtube run run run cleared innital mobs ran good minutes straight without seeing single soul town occassional gnome trader whos expensive anywaysfinally find set mobs still star higher cannot defeated starting gearand im ive abandoned wishing something else literally couldnt even find single star mob farm could get something better like lost game even began wish game still made would recomend cube world alot bugs need fixed first game fixed try play hope post better review would probably love game could actually play ive tried mods reinstalling game avail world simply wont load doesnt seem way fix maybe

quest may biome amount quests objectives complete along amount gear customization truly remarkable people especially restarting scratch likely working full timethe lore interestingly tied world either talking artifacts flavor text names weapons areas map makes searching lore books tombs worth eyesi understand everyone likes rinse repeat idle game formula especially done open world rpg like thisi

happened rerelease makes sad new version good totally worth full price totally worth game got abandoned dev worth anymore let clarify enjoy game wish yes wish kept somethings alpha yes normal person dosent like repetitive gameplay ok combat recommend get game would wait updates content think buying let prefers played alpha new version alpha certainly lacks polish enjoyable want love game want recapture magic first got mixed feelings time wasted dont feel like im progressing artifacts mainly add light climbing speed things could increase alpha leveling spent hours trying find artifacts far ive found one make hang gliding faster maybe maybe artifacts improved characters combat abilities would make experience worth nope gear except youre useless gear gets rendered obsolete soon enter new region whats point alpha could want explore world grow power theres point matter much progress make wind back square every time want adventure want love game wont love back game polished refined way

game first hours next please add progression system game beautiful extremely fun play gliding around finding new pets breath fresh air nonsense little reward artifacts feels disrespectful cant recommend game updated progression system real progression leveling unrewarding alpha ok potential none itas yet still trash mods may help game bit game fundamentaly flawed nope cant recommend currently game everybody also unfair project expectations somebody elses vision great game respect fun fun fun fun fun gonna lie game kinda sucks foundation movement solid fighting pretty enjoyable loops youll encounter theres much skill terms getting gear matter killing everything sight even means take advantage games mechanics respawn shrines example theres story weight progression unbelivably slow time especially beginning havent played alpha cant join train hating game bc changed much however negatives aside said solid foundation could great game recommend least going one biome disagree lot ideas exicuted game hold lot interesting game design ideas id like see updates improve game could good good good good good enough good gem like alpha cube worldnot worth recommend recommended fun enjoy rp games nothing interesting really reason anything seems except look new drop stay good play better hard fun good unless like running around empty landscapes nothing really worth moment needs lot work worth tho got free played alpha good worth money buy please update forever anything buy game please please worth money still feel empty worth money would good free play oh god cube world become game worse ever everything loved alpha gone wait theres get new zone game inventory gets reset skill trees gone fun aswellsorry cube world thought gonna big game years came horrendous one oh game good alpha ok im loving game goespositivesthe game solid state play tons things encounters everywhereloot actually drops enemies hard actually kill things anymore depending skill level time game releasemassive biomes areas clear get loot dungeons end everything areanegatives xp removed cant drop armor items weapons friends cant drop hp potions anything really inventory becomes mess really quicklyarea lock items utilties climbing spikes ability ride pet wistles ect love god remove lock items one wants client mod easily already made even put lock items first place bring back xpother moment really solid game fun play friends step new biome lose hours whatever hours things world cube long live grind guess ok wollay reading think game great issue without xp system less incentive kill anything also fix possessed shop owners possessed screwing store functions also would like variety travel merchants gem trader abundant also maybe even adding class jobs play styles per class limiting also please add things stores instead item day final note add map generation independent characters times areas dont like meaning delete character keep positive review hope pressure doesnt hope consider changing game back former glory one childhood game still love owned game alpha stage loved drastically changed since better peaceful cute designs fun spend time friends people complain lose equipment go different area see always new land beat hate get overpowered game enemies scale feel like never get powerful always chance run area return later stronger beat great game exploring always area beat performance issues options refuse save theres direction besides talking npcs getting fetch quest across map hang glidergood game needs time get patched im sure wollay make something great personally start game wasnt really enjoying picked rogue struggled fight kill monsters flew friends region downgrades gear restarted game started enjoy ive put almost ten hours game recommend overall think pretty decent game could make better introducing new feature removing like region downgrade could add new mechanics like building rebirth would take stuff away would powerfull think game lot potential would love see grow play mods please save suffering play mods played beta got excited disappointed played game since alpha wayy back around game getting update saw updates wollays twitter came come september beta releases hyped couldnt wait promised features alpha become reality genuinely excited game played back late middle school coming back graveunfortunately lot aforementioned promised features lead purchasing arent even game fact feels like removed things may done quality qol changes ability teleport shrines overall feels like one step forward two steps backi really tried enjoy beta really really tried feels frustrating start grinding hours region equipments stats go stars op stats way feels like beginning ironic explorative rpg punishes exploring outside region gear sure carry artifacts items name artifacts stats given artifact barely even affect anything things usually worthless ie swim speed lantern light size im sure items considering feels like rng getting ill try play see theres guaranteed way get themall think game could really use quite bit change specifically regarding way progression made theyre choosing keep artifacts artifacts actually boost players base stats instead something miniscule maybe change region locking works instead instantly reducing stats nearly nothing go away base region weaker stats become ie region weakens like half something regions make completely region locked something similar encourages people get better armor without completely screwing played game since came website sure alot changed still love core n honest prefer new system implemented everything gets wiped get new area please add back progressionleveling system pleasethere massive insatisfaction time change region loved gaining ton levels friends whenever killed bosses tough enemies point please add skill trees levels please clean things locations new characters please dont buy please fix game wollay want goodi like fun mods would recommend anyone current state please make real content gameplease pls go back old cube world dont like way game less fun way grindy less fun ive played hours finished whole area map went new area stuff reset sort frustrating would recommend game others pls make game fun remember watching vids game finally could get game fun way different positive review gamer babies expected either nothing unreasonable amount things change since alpha potential thats thing everyone forgot aboutthis game infinite growth potential fan would know planned updates havent rolled still comingthis game grow fun alluring truly adventure game people mad actual state game let rephrase thisthis game kindof early access grow change timejust dont jump conclusions wait pretty cool game play like pretty decent pretty fun game regional items annoying pretty good pretty good changes made little weird get used againstill somewhat feels like original played hoursbetter friends pretty good game tho game alpha compairing unfair stands merits pretty good rpg progression unique admittedly little grindy still fun beta classic rpg rules like leveling everything needs follow thatsets slight mental roadblock items get turned trash explore thats progression reverse happens rpgs everything scales absurd numbers instead resets want explore current area unique bad people think unique bad kinda dissapointed cant really describe good game friends without starting think bad due afromentioned unique progression choices probably one best games ever played year old male iowa looking love affection life wake every morning thinking something fun end making small figurines toothpaste caps father collects factory grandparents live infact lay around eat share hard earned food may life get better soon girls fyiihaveonefriend snapchat progress practically non existent loved previous version though bet bit modding could fixed possibly future update reallly awesome game play hours hours de bad thing get weapong new world meh isi pisi really good really good game could play days without getting tired really good lot fun along alpha really nice game enjoyed even though changed lot alpha still buy worth region lock lev system gone game big gay alpha region lock weird fun region locking gear equipment isnt good mechanic game still alot fun tho region locking items artifacts get useless like swimming yea useful game artifacts gives minor buff percent shitjust dont waste money game buy something valuableand wish wollay fix game dont think ever come unless six years removing progression outstanding move review good right game sucks even close alpha edition fun save money game worth current state seeing xp system change really disappointing way mods handel discussion forums disgraceful play min dont wanna support furthur dont get started region item locks shit could sth good simple little game worth paly smh game already perfect new version bs missing much smooth mechanics great downloaded game minutes ago working fine crashed wont load many good features removed runs like actual trash pc alpha runs perfect glad still cracked alpha game refunded sad lots great things game tied unplayable ones game many know bit rocky history creator pulled try finish started really respectprosthe general feel moving around events pretty fun future updates opening game steam workshop could expand make world populated terms contentthe weapon system fun able choose weapons fly great way change combatchanging job skills another great touch personally wish changing subclass currently improved onthis game hekin cute love look pretty much everything fun brightfinding items region quite satisfying changes travel uncover areaconsthe combat quite shallow controls well falls short bit attack small attack game would benefit form deeper skill system even ability find skills world equip could class specific others generali havent used crafting system gear find comes fast enough even bothering craft equipment almost waist time regards would ether focused crafting part bosses monsters drop materials craft better weapons simplified crafting something bit easier terms make found many apples travels recipes actually used themall items region lockedthe creator stated wanted game figure create sense exploration adventure discovering unknown felt wandered adjacent land boat disappeared bag items specific area even equipment lost value left starting zone fix would make key items like boat rewards larger dungeon player explores find hints items around maybe theres one item like per region stands could start bare bones walk literally anywhere world start fresh wherever went simply start fresh every time havent leveled hours playing gameif levels arbitrary game might actually benefit level system place make purely exploring finding better loot even skills level sits nothing feels really weird player since dont level enemies fighting seems really arbitrary since youll usually find gold per monster fightoverall really like game headed direction want expecting hope game continues grow improve time goes least open steam workshopim recommending hope keep striving become fantastic game sooo play like hours good luck get good weapon clear house get story region go get useless artifacts seeing boost mode travel find region separately become useless seeing find shrine fast travel location yeah sorry im done needed rant go back alpha mod still really fun super fun game would one best market bigger fanbase constant updates super fun friends although dislike dont get keep strength gear mobile utilities like boats gliders enter new region mods fix game developer seemingly disappeared wollay come back super sad takes new approach exploration rpg genre im loving tbh like game thing run around parkourtrickshots tbh imma lil sad dissapointed still pretty fun tbh game ok like games like get bit repetitive good game thats think know everyone hates people thought game would promised could updates thats got things promised think good people stop giving hate game hes tried hard game make liked think people going hate message go head im stopping think much hate goes wife game calm thank wollay releasing amazing game years well wasted game changed lot remember dont like levels ill give tryrpg fanand fix multiplayer plslets hope next updates fix thatty game woolay forpls woolay fix seriously fan base u caremake rpg pls alpa game much better relased game way game fed becose get everything one tilte move another one cant use op stuff start everything get tiltle uslles go another title like game downgraded alpa worth buying tldr simplifies poor choice progression mechanics leads counter intuitive play would expect adventure game decent system highly unbalanced favor harshly punishing player wanting explore everything see right see region bordersthe full extent issues comes places game advertised adventure rpg open world things rpg element comes overall class choices base classes specializations doesnt really matter equipped youll fight pretty much way simple tank spank shoot move stun lock targets playstyles much rpgso progression equipment wear tools find within region bound region alone making want explore new zone real degree start way bottom means equipment travel tools find everything stripped functional put perspective basic gear white quality star however see zone powerful bringing gear previous zone previous zone gear brought grey star quality progression loop stuck withgear exists though sure fire way get rng could luck get full set current region making neighboring region much easier gear however thats extent gear anything beyond also becomes worthless rare useful means player trading economy good finds point holding onto gear youve explored surrounding regionsin zone get tools store page showcases like hang glider boat tools biomes essential things moment leave region lose till go back good luck exploring ocean biome boat anymore get jump swim nearest island hope boat thereclasses bit unbalanced comes rpg territory mages squishy powerful warriors tanky damaging rogues squisy evasive heavy crit damage rangers shoot afar slow enemies thats extent class customization minimalist used robust long time agothe games decent quality see music well done doesnt wear thin hours playing keeps certain level fitting situation simplistic graphic design well done unique also looked like trove thing occasional problems building dungeon design beta might persist full release version aware usually big deal thoughall though cant recommend game must pick around signs glaring gameplay issues ever changing itll never really rpg infinite progression artifact system makes one get makes move bit faster form another boosts eventually cap much infinite progression system caps things alpha version waaaay better still okay alpha better every way alpha better spent years get rid xp system skill tree lol alpha better alpha better alpha better less buggy thiswhy would remove perfectly functional xp skill tree systems alpha better pls add back leveling system seed feture dont wanne play game go another zone best beta downgrade alpha say please wollay support encourage modding make changes game please beta better full release beta better combat good much exploration leveling happend alpha version playd alpha friends house good happend like alpha newer version one ddos attack wollays website left traumatized hes longer capable directly interacting others internet pleas better system never answered framework something really good needs time finalize two person team may take say early access im sure doesnt game changed lot seven yearssadly personally wont recommend game sure give chance maybe likin game dog shitwollay ran away release money good job reddit game fun game fun first hrs realized left region back weak started miss progression thought would build mods coming help fix issue painful play find new boat time want explore regions would recommend buying goes worth game fun play isnt much sense progression think reworks gonna make better game fun super grindy game fun ive waiting game come time enjoy however game needs much added like tutorial monsters wont tap game funny game pretty good bosses unbeatable regenerate almost instantly making give beating certain areas even five star items mobs still one hit makes sense whatsoever pretty fun game rough trust developer game extremely unenjoyable gear based progression unrewarding unsatisfying pray rng progress character killing enemies absolutely pointless time real motivation even get one shot time note skill tree makes confusing uninteresting cant even pick improve skills locked character whats point even classes youre gonna im even going get idiotic region locking items adventure based exploration rpg game right call self rpg current state skill trees clear character progression wollay took everything made cubeworld great threw garbage dont understand miss makes game great working years used love cubeworld still love alpha reason im refunding want see wollay responds backlash game still good region locked items mods removes adds cool stuff say worth game still beta takes roughly hours solo explore every biome see everything game offer levelling pointless literally nothing want like game youre looking rpg experience play alpha wait modders fix game game isnt good anymore game isnt used bewe waited years thiswollay please bring back old cube world game seemed decently fun first got hours almost completely finished starting area decided time move turns equipment region locked feature made game unplayable megranted items end resistant stop working edge radius rather crossing border better still bad game sucks get good stuff gos new area dies deletes progress game crapalhpa better game wont even run poorly optimized rendering new terrain take minutes play alpha much better didnt buy pirate something game would better everything wasnt region locked games starting point might little bit hard low grade equipment low resourcesbut thats learning curve experienced something unfamiliar people eventually get around itit still solid game though get wollays idea region locking items starting fresh biome players cant mow everything explore new biome acquire legendary geari hope future would combine alphas core mechanics game gameplay self good problem lack incentive keep exploting due really good effects relics give remuval levelling fro alfa mod like gameplay good game idea game good however way implemented poorly items locked biome found items leave region reduced nothing achieve biomes ludicrously small progress movement visual upgrades ex lantern light radius progress tiny easy get upgrades requires several hours complete biome artifacts artifacts gives upgrades chosen per biome often artifacts require hightest level gear biome give progress game seems designed biome hard restart tiny noncombat related upgrades gear locked biome find means transporting also locked biome location items like glider boat leash essential moving around displayed map go find dont recommend game current state new game still fun entertaining would recommend anyone even fun friends new mechanics much meso guess id better go back play alpha version better lot negative

uncalled crapfest obviously hiding behind curtain bad feels pretty fun multiplayer game however unintuitive really odd choices especially game centered around exploration plus side art still phenomenal controls pretty tight thanks region locking real felling ever earning anything makes game good common man play minute already know good current point recommend game people believe lot potential many problems game easilysemi easily fixed future updates look forward instead actually recommend game still incomplete still pretty ight game needs continued love support dev community look

tier easily without grinding levels skills shine fun time friends explore find challenging bosses wouldnt worth coin wow devs yeah yeah different original cube world essence still zelda cubes makes

also need fix items find one inside rock dont ask got also items one area one locks last thing need fun hours gets annoying think fun game start slow past fase really fun youd better playing trove yoyo yep good game mechanics discourage combat exploration rng hurts character progressionsix years ago cube world voxelbased action rpg released world alpha build though originally light content game managed hook players sometimes hundreds hours due satisfying intuitive gameplay mechanics many today would see cube world game others would see dream idea joining friends slaying ever powerful foes essentially boundless infinite world destructible terrain unique concept appealed backed game many years agoshortly release alpha updates game halted community heard little developer believing game abandoned many gave hope game ever updated others like believed game would eventually released would check online every months see news posted game developer long wait unfortunately disappointed game become please understand reason recommending game current state differs original roadmap though basically bought game back experience system gameplay mechanics stand discourage combat exploration hinder sense character growthbeing longer system character gains experience progression gearbased problem current implementation system opposed steady growth experience system random number generator control characters strength get lucky get legendary drops monsters quests others get two coins gear character class cannot equip also aside bosses enemies drop one two coins regardless strength rarely enemies drop item called leftovers identified back town turns piece equipment likely equipment class warp town identify items adds nothing compared enemies dropped weapons aside wasting time skills character unlocked getgo inability upgrade skills another factor harming sense characters progression strengthmoney serves little use game twelve hours playing game buy single thing besides starting gear fill open equipment slots found best way get better gear lure highlevel enemies npcs kill rather killed enemies maybe got unlucky drops experience get better equipment needed kill enemies significantly stronger kill enemies significantly stronger needed better equipment essentially character progression frustrating experience methis part mention region locking region locking mechanic equipment strength nullified entering different region mechanic makes legendary equipment weaker characters original starting equipment yes heard right thought locking character progression behind random number generator bad enough want realize icing cake since better equipment options shops locked behind quests using money basically buy back starting equipment new region found discouraged entering new regions thus hampering ability explore world heard exists plus equipment used adjacent regions entire time played come across single piece equipment region locking poor choice game mechanic according human psychology humans prefer avoid losses acquiring equivalent gainsin cube world find difficult kill enemies star rating greater weapon furthermore magic based creatures powerful need strong gear fight well point want complete last location region need better equipment kill witch castle trying complete could try craft equipment would need bunch boring resource farming materials craft equipment problem finish castle equipment make get nerfed moving next region makes really want may get lucky see plus gear crafting looking forward resetting day inn constantly look forward grinding coins afford thisthe full release cube world brings forth full quest system unfortunately thrilled implementation system experience involved spamming npcs gave quests markers personally feel like quest markers discourage exploration much better design event occur place map marker player enters area quest dungeon point hoping get better gear would rush quest marker trying avoid enemies much incentive kill essentially means spent much time walking straight line without really engaging world upon finishing quests little gained getting tired getting gear could equip class furthermore little variation quest system regions quickly get feeling playing game repeatedly dont see advantage going certain place kill monsters quest beta versus exploring killing monsters experience alpha beta tells go alpha encourages explore find boss slaythere issues game would like mention twelve hours played yet come across sort dungeon besides castle yet get artifact starting believe none starting region apparently boosts artifacts give character mediocre consisting upgrades like slightly larger lamp radius perhaps increase swimming speednothing resembling satisfying character progression despite bonuses working worldwide terrain generation ocean biomes taken noticeable drop quality compared ocean biomes alpha version game signs life found oceansnot even fish hang glider less useful requiring use half stamina offset initial nosedive another issue lack fog war hide undiscovered parts map takes much excitement knowing discover explorationin short many us cube world live dream new mechanics added discourage exploration combat harm sense character progression fundamental level work basic human psychology dungeons scarce artifacts useless quest system quickly becomes boring enough content locations make traveling feel like chore though bright note aside ocean biomes terrain generator creates breathtaking vistas fantastic music sets atmosphere perfectly disappointing best way define gamewhat started promising base relaxing video game experience shifted throughout years closeddoor development rather confused mess abandoned rpg characteristics favor roguelight experiencethe end result repetitive gameplay loop consists hunting loot region ready take specific dungeon houses artifact acquiring artifacts region player supposed move next one start
