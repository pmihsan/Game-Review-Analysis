feel rewarding enough completing one two regions without friends feels like theres nothing left game could go explore regions get artefacts purpose artefact slightly slows fast stamina runs water maybe want explore cool world design wollay modding community fix wont playing gameside notes point killing enemies arent travellers people objective rarely drop gear way improve power almost ignored therefore much interesting enemy design wasted enemy ai broken times experience enemies sometimes run around player standing completely still never attacking however isnt frequent doesnt affect game much crafting become obsolete time character point craft legendary gear basically already legendary gear similarly crafting expensive isnt really worth especially goes towards one region many promised improvements never implemented housing variation quests shown cube world quests preview classes races mmo serves etc guilds lore behind pretty barebones size mobile game development nearly decade sadly game isnt enough im traditionally major fan open world survival games strong difference breath wild forest cube world every open world game ive played content packed every corner cube world arid open world game synonymous least head rich content prioritize nonlinear story telling progression cube world breaks norm focuses traveling next objective instead getting mission running npcs way objective game chucks randomly generated hostile enemies either makes run away spend ten minutes fighting combat system one directional well lacks variety whatsoever wants use special ability run away wait recharge game would cool format nostalgia waited years full release new player like im playing roblox start quite difficult really enjoy game quite fun play grind learning game pretty neat time writing spent hours playing cube world enjoyed every second itcoming game first time wonderful new things discover around every corner every new bit gear exciting found large noticeable jumps power provided gear based progression much gratifying xp based systemthere much interact world actions feel like purpose getting new gear freeing trapped gnome camp ogres tells much interesting story might found alpha gameie commit crab genocide level upalthough overarching artifact progression system might benefit little bit oomph find core gameplay loop variance regions enough keep hooked game region far played differently due region looked gear sometimes youll fight tooth nail level weapon scrape together enough money buy better gear sometimes youll get lucky op weapon drop first boss steamroll region like godoverall would heavily recommend game big thank wollay pixxie making moment time give cube world long way go potential listen community feedback hopefully dont wait another years version optimistic development game quicker last time around youre unsure game like many wait updates cubeworld become full game point time core gameplay loop cube world makes game dry monotonous hours gameplay lack gripping emotional attachment game via story otherwise overarching content truly keeps engaged goal one given region factor consider purchaseeach region essentially areas explore difference biomes one region might circle power one might mausoleums something theres nothing work towards aside getting artifacts little supplement noncombat stats way level progressionit dulls theres nothing keep playing keep mind decide purchase game wish support wollay wife pixxie purchase game spend lot effort making wish game content keep playing point wish never would released cube world years silence bad stage cant recommend game people gameplay fun due new gear system punished exploring mods side step overall flow still needs adjusted base actually enjoy time beta know others hopeful adjustments made recommend game atm cant recommend game way better alpha regional stuff terrible ideaas many said lacks soul designer managed remove wierd make game go backwards releasing avoid like plagueextremely boring devoid direction contentwould good free game definitely game awesome game sadly received update since release really hope game continues get updates awful compared

always always love game extremely fun people alone preferred playstyle soloalthough things would like keep mind purchasing playing items specifically set certain regions areas game legendary item reset back common item player walks specific region item bound although items bound multiple different regions areas starter location areas regions player spawn area could possibly contain high level enemy cubeworld replayable game especially friends various things within game quests bosses dungeons messing around cubeworld aesthetically pleasing graphics stylethat pretty much concludes review

truly reach september steam release announced years waiting still holding onto slim hope cubeworld would make grand reappearanceit failed years ago took months ago took hopetoday decided write review tell wollayshame man see reasoning feel pity second time youre worthy support whatsoever knew exactly time arounddont buy game dont make mistake teenager buy false promises gives another thing regret back bit fun running around game spend bunch time dying sent back spawn always hoped game would fill time stay away back alpha core gameplay loop made well managed support hours play wise barebones game time chose strip game ill never knowhowever certainly say nowhere barebones beta maybe hours alpha cant stand even hours beta especially read peoples experiencesedit wasnt bad enough longer log picromacom get access steam key download old alpha basically bought game alpha didnt sync steam key website luck joke back day years ago alhpa beautiful encouraged exploring fighting leveling becoming strongernow game shell former self everything made game good removed backed alpha turned collectathon collectibles arent worth getting getting collectibles purpose game bad game honestly worth year wait bad progression system much fun bad dont buy worth based hours played time thus far really enjoying cube world flaws minor really stand outthe combat gotten added skills since alpha feels solid really feels like skill take good deal higher enemieswithin reasoni like exploration though sometimes regionlocking gets way exploring enjoyment moving another region one things enjoyed alpha finding big mountain jumping hang gliding across map something find often cant anymore unless managed find regions hang glider usually somewhat easy get way overall enjoymentone major flaw lack information explanation game mostly doesnt tell anything enemy difficulty colours classes class skills regionlocking etc hard enough returning players like see big problem new playerssummaryoverall really enjoy game needs bit time oven would like heartily recommend game cant go far current state merely say get past flaws youre likely good time unsure waiting sale always optionnote thus far experience multiplayer hence opinions singleplayer onlyprosgenerally enjoyable mechanicsgood combat systemnice art style id call snes rpg varied terrains creatures enemieslots fun pets love stuff like riding beetle named ringo battle fly named jeffnice transportation mechanicssome issues though see con game poorly explained often explained allthe regionlocking gear though see merit idea applied much harshly getting star become bad worse starting gear enjoyable maybe cut starting star green starsthe regionlocking transportation itemshang glider boat reins kind discourages exploration bit good explorationfocused game option generate world seed removed basically game good things might need reworking game different alpha version xp traditional leveling taken favor gear based progression system gear tied region found two changes lot people seem problem ill address review id first like talk new content systems addedquests given npcs help give player direction objectives reach exploring lot rewarding thanks greater amount points interest map quest variety pretty good nearly hours im still finding new types quests mobs structures classes new reworked abilities fast travel shrines region consumables scale equipment level music game remap controls scale ui many changes add atmosphere game improve qol things make game better alphathe core progression changes arent worse alphas xp skill tree system different require getting used gear tied region fun change lets experience region mini adventure end goal region get regions artifacts increase level give small stat buff noncombat related stat point move new region basically sent back square one makes feel like youre really progressing much really starting scratch changes would like see travelling gear like boats hang gliders climbing gear universal artifact stat increases substantial also core stats like health attack power etc changes would help player feel like actually progressing complete region even though essentially losing armor reverting back default state moving new areaoverall im lot fun game would like see changes made progression system basically game good got released steam leveling zonelock trash could great game got abandoned time would recommend veloren instead want try game like get cubeworld modded beautiful rpg enjoyed player coopas veteran love update diversity lookonly downside imo gets kinda repetitive game doesnt beautiful game great potential current state quickly becomes boring progress gear etc made character disappears move regions gear drop rates dont work wellthere levels dont get gaining experience points get collecting certain items level youre rewarded small boosts inane things like climbing speed skills character beginning cannot level increase damage stronger geargear drop rates dont work well get strong equipment quickly played beta friend almost full legendary gear hours playing words practically gotten strong possible current region feel resistance enemies would move new region start less zerostarting new character frustrating easy die beginning youve found first green gear pieces started snowballing sometimes spawn temple almost minutes away place died nightmare especially nighttime many different monsters almost murder character see far dark cannoti hope wollay trashes current progression system brings back something like one used cube world alpha wasnt perfect fairly classic rpg system experience points gained killing monsters could spent gaining strengthening different skills skill tree never left feeling emptiness even monster killed didnt drop items slowly gained stronger stronger gear wouldnt disappear moving regions could freely explore different regions without game smacking head removing progressin short cube world get kicked around enemies find better gear quickly snowball power point youll decide whether want run around hours steamrolling rest region level get practically worthless reward b enter new region get kicked around enemies find better gear continuing cycle pain could become voxel equivalent classics like terraria diablo currently manages inferior alpha despite years development beautiful game feels nice play almost tech demo anything real content beyond hour mark complete region repeats process struggling get good item snowballing moving around region snails pace levelling skill upgrades changes even combat thought would saving grace game gets boring tedious end hold shift clean aisle npcs bland repetitive dialogue dungeons ive seen far glitchy graveyard demon portals cauldrons surrounded mobs modding supported could good go revitalizing game doesnt seem like theres going incentive support steam workshop despite knowing dubious nature game beforehand bought game anyways hoping people cry babies game finished hope main devs dont run money thousands others shoveled actually use improve unfinished game possibly creating team money moment feels like situation timber stone stonehearth pretty game lot potential left abandonedat moment shouldnt buy game give months year come back check updates beautiful game got originally alpha love bit difficult play single player like challenge multiplayer much easier much like dd highly recommended especially enjoy games like dd minecraft legend zelda killing monsters doesnt increase counter people crying game worthless youre interested exploring regions nice sceneries steamrolling every single thing game forever farming gear hours game lot fun level progression done away means gear thing left also means gear everything gear let alone good gear rarely dropsits impossible kill anything isnt baby level without cheesing game unless really good gearbecause consistent progression except gear gear cannot used beyond one area need start overof course could find super duper rare gear star lets go next area keep stats thats even rarer good gear first placethere point playing game payoff point anything everything meaningless got good gear nope next area got bad gear tough everything within miles oneshot health powerful combo good luck grinding get chance loot playing since wonderful indie game following game since alpha release hope see improvement updates impressive considering made husband wife since original release update cycle management history game insulting anyone purchased end day feels like developer shielding around pity producing excuses whilst okay reaching pocket without providing reasonable presence communication development progress development speed content quality

might hopeless fix essential problems alpha wasted opportunity wollay worked community dedicated helping become great adventure gamecube world nowhere near ready releasedwhat wollay needs install revealed last years removed reason communication key doubt point would ever happen cube world games like taught valuable lesson never getting invested game released good playat worst would consider everything wollay done since alpha false advertising bait switch either let anyone bought alpha get refund legal repercussions beta tester yeah great however might worth picking modding community

terrain seems vanished hand gliders thing lot fun usenow get money yay youre newcomer might fun im likely jaded old build big sad wish could go back game gave hope bit dissapointing whole progression alpha got dumbed simplified added fact cant use items regions dissapear go new region kind annoying bizarre confusing progression system little content something thats supposed full game also glitches version game alpha build things along devs dont communicate community disappear great lengths time word make impossible recommend game blast past fun awhile blog deleted word creator since day prior launch looks like going updates game steam reviews tell worth buying current stae boring repetitive first area due regionlocked gear effectively resetting character anytime fancy change scenery boring repetitive first area due regionlocked gear effectively resetting character play alpha boring game based exploration character progression punishes exploration removes progress made every chance gets expect spend hours working towards lantern radius similar sub par improvements equipment traversal gear removed years full release cubeworld much less content alpha version bought alpha years ago amid early times fell love gamebeen closed beta coming alpha learning curve love hours beta running around exploring ever bought played alpha first came got sucked game even felt character got stronger continued leveling finding better gear exploring character hardly feels like anything even gets taken crossing border new region stupid new region locked equipment shit yes besides still flaws would take away region locked equpment nonesense game would atleast playable degree cause less hard earned progress wouldnt get thrown thrash time want explore another region bought game alpha fun could become easily overpowered blow everything cube world fun way dont worry becoming op continue explore endlessly new gear become stronger per region hard get special travel items region bound well helps slow progress urge check every nook cranny zone want defeat bought game earlyaccess many years ago thinking would turn fun game completely wrong wish could get money back bought alpha years ago honest prefered alpha cube world endless farm fun friends unfortunately today friends doesnt enough connection play together system furthermore may great idea delete xp think well used game dont like game today hope hope back days hope make game better better please wollay tell came back youve retrieved developing insane game cube world manner bought alpha game doesnt feel fun past first region real progressionits essentially replaying dull hours repeat different scenery bought back alpha state worth wait must rpg experience opinionalthought good points games state bought release happy think new system funny worth long wait would recommend okay grinding really bought years ago legitimately better bought alpha back years lateralmost nothing new added lot ways worse alpha thenits fun couple hours play coop way worth bought alpha years back release feels like game going backwards cant recommend game current state fun alpha significantly better almost every way massive changes need made make fun bring back xp killing mobs take away region lock better purpose explore bought alpha awesome infinite rpg came back years latter expecting better game instead got completely different game basically horribly designed adventure roguelike fun got equivalent bait switched bought alpha many years ago got free steam key sucks bring back alpha please thanks bought game years ago still waiting good update bought game back friends showed shortly dev went completely radio silent none updates showed working ever got added six years later got excited see game getting real release steam found old account information could use old key play final game hour uninstalled changes ruined experience regardless think game good current state cant deny pretty fckd devs make game promised bought game back alpha days waited years released happy new updates beta game based region locked weapons armour become useless move another region unique takes fun away first fun quickly got bored bought game back alpha launchedthe game great lacked things overall great exploration amazing never felt bound place got see monuments leveling getting new skills new equipment ofcourse good lootfrom could tell back game felt heading weird cross legend zelda dungeon running looting experience diabloworld warcrafthonestly point game felt needed quests varied loot cool special effects builds could wildly varied items ofcourse skill tree yet finished reason normal attack actually damage weird right sarcasmnow finally got quests items lets go special areas however came great costyour character longer becomes powerful leveling slightly small stats like speed different vehiclesyou dont get keep loot get travelling new zone even boats hang gliders means want explore ocean travel island swimming pray gods believe boat area first island visit randomly generated terrain quests meaning odds find first find last funinstead amazing freeform exploration player could carve adventure without friends youre forced stay one region youve completed finally youre burnt one zone youre supposed move next collect items thing different placenot starting seems incredibly unfair atleast back could kill trash mobs easily farm xp start would kind questing system help get xp make levelling process bit fun plus since xp removed drop rates items normal mobs low enemies way dont get rewarded interacting unless quest even didnt really matter since youll leave area anywayalso since basic attacks miss combat feel floaty disjointed get items point combat become kind fun doesnt matter since soon want new backdrop youre back square one tldr game potential become one best procedurally generated looters instead came something completely else core gameplay mechanics seem halfway thought throughi see idea behind region lock ends disheartening wanted new character wouldve made one myselfnow imagine old cube world could find lot random quests killing mob youd find quest gave one magical items like harp could use world find loot making exploration easier like bought hang glider boat shops back daysorry wollay excited seems like radical change core gameplay done oven even im sure would ever entirely cookhope youll add old progression back kind different mode since honestly went back played alpha much rewarding punished wanting see desert bought game back echo feelings negative reviewsi played beta hours see clearing several zones timethe alpha experience far better nostalgia still dl original cubeworld accountits much better almost everyway main beta benefit flight master imorip cubeworld bought game alpha im happy finally released years cubeworld isnt quite alpha believe pros cons big difference current version based artifact region progression gear rather exp ive enjoying change progression starts feel linear get new regions artifacts provide passive buffs gear becomes worthless find gear works neighbouring regions feel like improved future artifacts useful buffing health stats like crit attack regeneration ectexploration alot fun get used new progression system map isnt procedurally generated actually one map almost infinite still get unique experience everyone else map zoom close see points interest add waypoints onto later region different chests hidden everywhere arenas unique bosses things affecting like petrified towns npc possession mana pumpsone big cons tutorial telling class skills starting gear except weapons start hard new old players first thing recommend mark town buy available gear activate wayshrines discover reduce travel time well theyre usually evenly spaced collect resources discover crafting gear potions inventory unlimited space limited stack item feel like lack tutorial needs fixed future starting region tutorial area somethingin end feel like could recommend game feel like got moneys worth still lots pros cons game feel like potential dev said lots ideas future cubeworld look forward comes next bought game alpha got enough hours fun salty make review short recommend game spend lot time walking engage boring combat relatively simple enemies little terms progression vertical horizontal even little basic action game prettyish landscapes pretty empty overall bought game early childhood bit tough times get key beta im big fan regional items absolutely idea level despite many youtubers tell toi would reccomened

years like everyone else played alpha plenty cant help think completely different game engine simply stapling quests onto game mechanics alpha would better cant good faith recommend going say hasnt said long story short completely flopped delivery one heck let easy heck read negative reviews would encourage look things youtubeshame really thats way goes cant play doesnt work windows thats say wish could least see people arms game loooooved alpha version alas cant play managed run minutes another computer review due minimum minute requirement actually make reviewill change review gets updated day work windows youre windows user wont able play cant recommend due unfortunate design choices made devs would region lock progression items infinitely generated adventure game doesnt make sense whatsoever might possible balance even though never happen without mods wish old xp progression back spawn enemies get progressively difficult farther travel thing alpha needed fixed better bosses terrain quests fixed perfectly good mechanics replaced cant recommend doesnt feel like anything besides collect artifacts give mediocre noncombat stats faster sailing lamp radius collect stuff armor glider boat reins etc already collected times past whenever go new region cant recommend great alpha changed core years lots qol improvements game lacks substance form zero replayability feel youve completed zones cant recommend game current state happens hide away years dont work communityi played alpha really thrilled beta huge let farim hoping pull big nomansky cant recommend game current state thing comparable old alpha cubeworld graphics game mechanics pulled trash canister directly imported game without thought balancing fun cant recommend game good faith get sale really want cant recommend game current state seems like took almost everything game reasons cant fathom gone random dungeons leveling character items im hoping hope make major changes near future game

update cant wait real game finally released hopefully happens die real life tick tock times wasting years later rewritten great game enjoy game systems make sense buy game expect patches updates new content least years longer time cube world version end released going whim say possibly may solid cube world game stay tuned bois dont give yet cannot recommend cube world current state cannot recommend game current state progression needs thing cannot recommend game game returned direction alpha see video details cant really recommend game really hyped news full release tbh alpha way better region locked items real levels feels lacking rewarding play cant recommend current form basically forced create new character time change region one region takes maybe couple hours complete thats basically content refunding though want hope money enables create game aspired cant recommend game current state cash grab patch since launch communication week launch probably stayed week give new players hope updated fun around biomes around hours realize shit casual positive review counter whining people complain change alpha betait good change one unique gameplays ever fun maybe hard get perfect means worth reviewing negatively especially considering people made game current elements get fleshed combat exploration lore finding artifacts making potions weapon customization spirit cubes game potential become time classic cannot stress enough doesnt need new elements especially change progression system need exp bar alright legit flesh mentioned elements perfect game nonetheless already really fun play current variety artifacts keyitems makes worth least explore randomly generated biomes playthrough pretty versatile playtime around hours bad changed number core gameplay mechanics alpha progression almost nonexistent clearing region resets equipment reward usually unnoticeable buff artifact leave first region reward small removes gear achievements fighting monsters feels useless boring leveling means abilities cannot scale movement grow new abilities either listed site planned feature getting around slow need find glider first unrewarding entire map already revealed game start leaving region strips movement items boat glider even feels punishing good elements present poorly executed overall step forward steps back alpha hopefully updates come around based last years dont see happening changes alpha pretty badthe game still nice lacks cheat protection progression interesting best need go interesting great locations literally give best gear around leave location important real progression comes artifactsthe worst thing traveling items region locked loose boat upon entering new part ocean drop glider enter new location feels bad find things anew tedious fun considering apart stat bonuses artifacts give bonuses exploration tied transports timehope game improve thatapart still fun engaging game alpha chill fun doesnt require much thought good want space chill openworld exploring game would better balanced every class got public servers back game kinda expensive buy want fun friends night hours closed beta cubeworld cubeworld signed

unless something changes feels like wasted potential coming beta say different conventional rpgnone less love game years ago first posts alpha starting pop compared alpha game much better terms combat quests however region locked gear could improved upon make progression feel lot better complete radio silence developer since release game steam super promising game beloved features seemingly gutted reason whatsoever completely different alpha strayed away better different still good game though honestly really like completely different pitched randomly generated exploration rpg turned roguelite completly different game alpha even less content dont trust developer considering story behind game developers give good review compared alpha years ago cube world change lot still offers great exploration experience time comes twist rpg type games devs trying something new unique progression system wont please everyone though since dev seems quick fix bugsissues im sure cube world massive potential become something even greater need give time considering need mod make game even enjoyable id say one buy really want buy though wait sale give scammers published little money possible go

extraneous circumstance support email still operational like isnt someone background operating things waited year writing make sure hasnt even tweet couple words entire time cool game better played friends core systems game make game unfun game rpg exploration game open world lacks definition region lock punishing leave zone gear becomes useless unless farmed ultra rare versions hours leveling system everything balanced around rng drops walking swimming simulator items designed improve ability get around need unlocked every single new zone exploration non existent point point everything stronger walkswima good example poorly thought systemyou leave zone boat unlocked enter ocean zone boat disappears cross border forcing swim closest town even reach town chance told boat unlock zone

systems everyone likedthe dev selfish opinion matters doesnt want hear opinionsthe mods forums include many white knights fanbois arent bad many aretldrthe game sucks dev took years didnt said hed expect abandon game shortly release doesnt want feedback say great shut could great game dev never listened community gone radio silence mostly years shame could great isntextremely easy game play everything basic repetitive challenge minimal progress thing progress artifacts matter collect pets anything else irrelevant even items useless get different biomdo buy wait big changes updates could good like alpha gave reason explore explore skills go away bounds still good updates feels rushed dev wouldnt deal game anymore stress brought want something similar better play trove free could great game creator able accept valid criticism seems rather wanting echochamber community prime example developer communicating followersi love game put hundreds hours alpha polished yes fun definitely notas stands buy creator stopped releasing updates years said personal project people shouldnt expected constantly work happy take peoples money cube world alpha funchallenging skillbased adventure rpgcube world release stale unplayable unless u get lucky rngbased stay one place unless want start lacks rpg elements skilltrees progression refunddont buy game think gonna bring back memories years ago almost unrecognizable cube world alpha better cube world beta unfortunately quite disappointing cube world alpha generic rpg simple graphics simple game design obvious objective explore get stronger however despite simplicity game quite delightful graphics controls simple refreshing compared big time rpg games guild wars diablo massive story plot key skillsabilities full flare colors feel like charm cube world actually straightforward game wasin beta depth added gameplay parts enjoyable like reason talking npcs explore world new mission system increased difficulty game end picromas efforts trying counter flaws founded alpha ended slacking improving charm game straightforwardness instead replace theres feeling pointlessness point exploring achieving strong item leads nothing stats said item disappears upon entering new biome point striving levels leveling merely improves incredibly useless stats one biome essentially next theres joy forced replay thing overi feel however gameplay may greatly improve overall leveling simply significant meaning cube world beta disappointed review long time fanive following cube world since beginning ive purchased game soon released continued playing time time today things made stick game endless beautiful world fun gameplay coop capability spent hundreds hours exploring levelling characters collecting every pet game game early alpha stage mind beta release countless people patiently waiting years booted game played game hours closed game dont drive go back right put front think game still lot things liked alpha multiplayer beautiful endless world example still main problem gameplay precisely new progression system alpha used relatively standard rpg progression system based gathering xp level skills allow wear better gear found system worked pretty well motivated explore fight enemies smaller bigger moments satisfaction kept progressing fitting endless nature gameall gone beta contrary alpha solely uses gear based progression system game means increase characters power collecting new better gear doesnt sound bad right away devil detail gets worse discoverfirst gear collect region bound meaning becomes pretty much useless outside region picked forcing collect new gear every time enter new region feature alone removes feeling long time progression game every time collect shiny new piece armor new weapon remember going useless try travel progress next region inevitably going happen minutes write alpha since youd keep finding stronger gear enemies think certainly could continue picking new gear go werent forced least soon even stuck gear couple hours could still deal enemies little bit effort beta hand absolutely forced collect new gear since loses worth soon go new region gear find completing region doesnt help much either since works adjacent regionssecondly glider boat also tied system means youll search new glider boat every minutes heavily limits freedom exploration makes whole thing lot annoying needs thirdly since enemies strengths present regions gain strongest gear game first couple minutes gameplay happened right away stumbled upon boss mob region managed kill help npcs collected yellow weapon enabled instantly kill enemy region removing challenge sense progression experiencefourthly since skills unlocked right away gameplay experience going stay throughout playtime summarize points think new progression system huge downgrade previous one removes feel real progression makes general gameplay less interesting also negatively influences exploration big go game like cube worldanother thing im disappointed formerly planned features game still lacking features like building bases skills classes pet evolution mmo servers still got promised features like new biomes procedural quests feel like span six years shouldve achieved even people developing game even worked sideas much id like recommend game simply cant state especially people new game isnt build playi hope wolllay pixxie take community feedback incorporate game turn game deserves many things right theres still much potential explored please take communities valid criticism ignore mindless hate toxicity going emerge please continue work game people stuck long passionate aretldr progression system bad rest still good dont recommend yet cube world refreshing hours content fed

back cube worldthe rpg elements gone loot drops far less map much harder use crafting seems pointless skill trees gone get skills start lose fun unlocking upgrading need find town change specialization default towns marked map spawn points offer quick travel activate first revive one closest revive points far less frequent death means pointless walking didnt need tutorial get started dive game unclear supposed controls streamlined customized music really good looks polished much offits bad game excited see completed taken many turns fun fast paced rpg slow paced exploration game involves running death little feeling accomplishment gathering randomly generated lore boring seems new focus dont understand region locking gear seems enforce isnt lootgear game anymore tons fun multiplayer alpha got friend join bit fun friend somehow multiplayer got really buggy syncing way even two people fights dont get much rewarding made even frustrating fact cant grind get power towns dungeons longer marked map took us hour find town could play together time find second town identify leftovers hopes could equip gear things marked map like boss mobs find didnt find enough gear increase star rating able actually fight much got bored stopped playingtldr short wouldnt recommend steam version fun game youre looking exploration game voxel setting may fortunately still download alpha version website hope play patcher upgrades better version game lost history cube world could much morei absolutely love fact wollay tried something new didnt stick classic cut paste rpg formula level use skill tree gradually gain skills way bad way go rpg many games use formula repeatedly added substance see wollay wanted get away go gear based progression something thats explored lately games like destinyexcept wollays version sucksso spawn cube world huge region explore find loot hard start get hang things progressing various missions available region eventually congrats youre covered legendary gear missions region donethen move next region realize progress carry across borders fuck artifacts supposed permanently buff character cannot carried regions well top permanent progression literally willingly go back step one decided go new regionwollay know know isnt state game like mention various flaws features teased straight scrapped reason spent six years know passion game make good far havent done much prove game isnt know wish could recommend game state worth iti stuck game six years forgave wollay time every time made excuse want refund cube world buy bag chips turns bag mostly air already went bad three weeks ago game better alpha six years ago endless nowadays sets already set world nothing stuck area fear losing progress items went past bordermy main three complaints game gameplay original drained purgatory borders remove progress cross dont know anybody else problem majority attacks used never hit enemy attack straight went enemy didnt anythingi definitely fun game without doubt back alpha current state id say worth money change remove borders andor bring back original style game actually put work building character instead giving perks moves immediatelyalthough best things ive seen cube world much better graphics art compared alpha stable fps matter much stuff rendered cube world great foundation core systems make amazing gameplay experience get better time progression issues none impossible developer navigate throughdefinition constructive criticism constructive criticism process offering valid wellreasoned opinions work others usually involving positive negative comments friendly manner rather oppositional oneif look negative comments dont deserve called feedback reviews arent definition criticism constructive criticism reasoning based logical thought negative comments stem entitled behavior immediate emotional decision making cube world barely evolved years fact feels like regressed mostlyxp removed favor map completion gear based game understand change maybe get behind however everything else executed poorly wish stayed samethe game wants exploration decides region lock gear even important utility items like hand glider essentially ruining progression turning game unfun roguelike world huge yet rather empty grow hate time must spend going b back spawnpoint glider feels nerfed since alpha requiring stamina needed spend time travelling gamedifficulty curve start laughably broken feels like way progress cheese encounters coop win numbers found corpse running often dark souls balance took nose diveit also doesnt help gear drops seem rng could come source often though gear drops class arent playing crafting huge grind akin hardcore mmosthe form progression artifacts dont make much sense mostly pointless example would find bell used would phase spirit realm ask even spirit realm wouldnt able tell need good description probably buff moment game feels like hugely unrewarding grind unsatisfying disappointing hope hytale right fans genre cube world changed still like something different youll get used still enjoyable switch characters different areas weapons dont matter anymore thats plus however stuff works next area would nice cube world regressed almost every conceivable fashion since release alpha six years ago meaningful progression everything collect becomes useless leave region found incentive fight enemies exp reason explore actually punished gear taken away could play one region hours walking location location looking scenery inferior alpha version using minimap inferior alpha version virtue covered fog already see entire world looking map surprises youre done walking get sometimes go dungeon honestly better designed dungeons alpha good luck getting entire skill system gutted enemies two settings game invincible terminator complete pushover happen find legendary weapon isnt rare sounds youve game leave region course causes everything taken away end day show hard work extra meters lantern radius faster boating speed slower stamina consumption climbing game current state frankly jokei bought played alpha release game dozens hours wasnt feature complete showed promise core gameplay loop fun actual meaningful progression exploration instead spending past six years improving upon base delivering truly fantastic experience developers coldly ripped anything could seen fun engaging game world would recommend less one cube world current state might people expected different doesnt mean badi like doesnt teach things find everything like games old beat feel like real badassright world feels little bit empty theres lot gameplay missing however potential little bit love game become great cube world rpeg role playing exploration game sounds interesting read overall get game like idea exploring around fighting hard bosses minor focus getting temporary loot dont get right looking game level like traditional rpgscube world fun problems blast playing alive alpha atmosphere amazing game play fluid exciting game genuinely fun explore however probably aware progression system centered around region locking itemsthis terrible zone hours content however needs improvements progression system make rewardingdo recommend cube world depends need changes yes going buy game need know game finished like exploring feeling conquering zone zone idea gear downgrading drastically enter new region bother sure recommend game bother still powerful enough beat basic enemies harder ones become challenge like able refight hard boss fight instead getting easier easier like rpgsthe game currently rewards players exploring thats level based rewards opinion amazing thereother reviews talk promised wollay communicate true bear mind unfinished gamethank enamean cube world beautiful depth game give chancethis isnt average rpg game nobody telling go thats makes game greatjust like rpgsmmos dont beat game day play grow experience world comes exploring world knew nothing back alpha years ago beyond fun im excited time content cube world fantastic game concept design bit flawed take moment enjoy true potential shines party element early adopter ive lot time game beautiful aesthetic wonderful charms whimsy take quite ride region region dont truly realize much stuff packed one region actually explore carefully easy miss ton stuffhowever writing game flaws theyre ironed gameplay isnt balanced writing design elements arent perfectly flowing ways isnt say game future game presently writing worth assuming continues get ever frequent doting amounts love bugfixes getting course last weekthe game problems developer historically speaking done much project since inception years ago thats lot time games quite like cube world theres lot budding potential hope game really blossom burned many perhaps game may redeem self future ill likely change review detail worsens gets better substantial way cube world fantastic game expresses creativity possibilities exploration rpgs various features quirks game seen far shaky start beginning minor annoyances would say excellent game perfect choice players enjoy games like breath wild etc would recommend yes would change things probably hotel trivago cube world fantastic game absolutely loving far played since alpha still love game especially changes madewollay pixxie made great gameignore negative reviewsall reviews want game isnot one negative review anything constructive sayi would defs recommend game cube world fantastic game dont get wrong ive alpha player since early days technically got free paid waaay back sooo got hyped lots lots times even though put back expectations around release realising probably would heavily disappointed hyped muchsadly game couldnt keep even lower expectations lot lovely mechanics changed already right place needed ploshing upgrades elements got either completely removed still lack general execution lets stay positive first let tell great work executed considering mostly made single person couple got harassed development also organise manage whole life behind covers cube world fantastic idea great execution way feels play smooth controlled absolutely stunning way defined whole new desire type game even back earlier game plays without hazzle even though makes machine run hot holding promises far description goes delivers mostly anything needs said definetlydoes mean promises good game perfect meansthis way sadly already swing negative feedback feel bad saying version feels like major step backwards weirdly beta alpha already dont know vision removing expsystem upgrade lower weapons higher levels currency optained quests seems well thought especially almost gear get either region locked locked behind another class fighting enemies servers almost purpose quest hunting getting equipment since enemies give amount gold anyway even pushes kill themi struggle see purpose playing game player receives info whatsoever goes explores sounds refreshing relaxing theory alpha showed already grind stacking quests motivate players long enough even come back game longer time exploration even heavily cut regions way deadly completed last one resulting frustrating experience one makes fun play bit relaxing exploring aspecton top fighting burden progression progression made feels unrewarding hear one see fighting give artefacts equipment money real deal fight die lure enemy city spawn point get op gear kill everything go next region almost everything resets power levels point creating black white power scale either get oneshot oneshot enemies fighting used way become stronger felt natural every aspect especially combined skill tree sort even encounter well balanced enemies artefacts get underwhelmingly unsatisfying useless get permanent boat speed find boat first every new region even find new cross invisible border better said flying f even kicked boat hangglider mount cross specific pixels screen damning die suddenly fall sky drown ocean getting bonus something use permanently something new wished never knew existed gamebefore jump back conclusion something short emptiness graphics yes heard right feel like game empty course cube world cubes distinct style feel cant feel different see blank spaces paths fields also water without wishing love detail ground youre walking beautiful feel like something belongs interaction bombs example gone cold lifeless often gives curves ambience ambience also missing sense sound player enemies make real noises bird tweeting distant humming close hornet nests add lot stunning part negatively oceans look back alpha oceans different landmasses interesting undersea hills oceans almost flat lifeless fishes enemies deep oceans contain small islands half open dungeons raid ease laziness goes lot graphical things like opening windows doors getting dynamic characters know know thats style might spoiled lot minecraft games feels stiff wrong doors open character even kind idle animation small things would make feel much welcome yet sadly thinga design really grinded gears bad way also caused region forced gear worst example actually give get last artefact region dungeon crossed different regions gear get suddenly weaker crossed invisible line one tunnels enemies could also tricked luring part stronger thus exploiting whole dungeon see going ways either suddenly hard easy thanks exploit really hope better idea coming region lock fix border crossing dungeons also encountered several enemies couldnt die dont mean missions unkillable helpers also deal dmg serve dummies mean boss dug ground become untargable heal every undead warrior healed dmg dealt one hit back hp dealing full blown combo star gearwell oh well rant whole negativity still really love game personally continue playing time looking forward prove wrong harsh judgement hope updates come faster since people playing mods workshop especially patches correct things right directionis game worth price maybe certainly everyone anyone interested give shot time future sale hopefully years see happend goes river rightfully blame everything everyone becomes better updates hope experience fate mans skyps twitter teased content like big cities seem implemented cube world fun cute openworld actionrpg needs approached differently normal get best theres real leveling system play instead stats enhanced gear rare drops tied region found region series quests found chatting wandering adventurers chasing gets items open area hang glider soar air boat dont swim everywhere etc frequently rewards better items monsters dont large aggro area easy avoid pull something thats tough either run away find helpful band wanderers take little strategy area becomes new challenge requiring full exploration search gear well rare crafting materials time start zero beginning game theres question epic weapons armor served well previous area gone crossing border new section map youve still got knowledge handle encounters plus crafting materials necessary get started conquering new land meant give player something constantly quest know youre getting approach realization skyrim cube world works fine cube world fun game thing would change make better one region lock gear wish setting get though makes dont get overpowered piece equipment dont need anything else thing quests might due exploring lot areas quests seem lack diversity overall would recommend game play group friends game shines best cube world game exploring key start game might bit hard start low level gear wont able defeat enemies get hang game feel quite rewarding sandbox game doesnt seem much end goal set goals like clearing areas gaining artifacts artifacts items affect every area go unlike normal items region locked mainly raise values affect travel speed certain percentage first might feel somewhat underwhelming gain faster easier explorei think game great feel like lot people havent given enough try cube world game came way back promise regular updates developer drew comparison minecraft several games purchased game way back days launch game received single bug fix update fixed bugs silence never regretted purchase alpha fun combat system went around exploring landscape fighting enemies gaining xp leveling gain skills stats finding powerful armour weaponsrecently game come steam promising essentially cube world developer said full time job engine completely rewritten feel fact bugs exist game existed alpha build came years ago game uses new progression system like world divided zones gear loses stats exit zone found utility items crafting manuals hang glider boat tied area found personally like system thats matter opinion word generation also lot boring specifically oceans ocean biomes consist several small islands supper annoying get lose boat soon enter ocean biome furthermore skill trees removed start skills way improve dont like definitively bad system game also limits world per character instead alphas terraria like system characters freely move worlds dont know removed ability dedicated servers also removed reasoninstead gaining xp leveling killing things level finding stat boosting artifacts would make okay except stats boost useless adding small percentage lanterns radius artifacts gave good buffs combat skills losing gear going next zone would bug deal would still feel like progressing right feels like creating new character starting step game amazing music needs feel like songs overall game could great developer listened community feedback communicated us added added developer terrible communication silence since game released steam twitter updates per year alpha release steam release addition many things alphas todo list make version explanation game feels like potential developer would listen community put smaller much frequent updates explain reasons odd changes change things based feedback similar games like minecraft snapshots cube world game surely divide choices experiences cube world fun really enjoyable experience charming solid gameplay spark love exploration adventure voxel game stay aware game really repetitive biomes discutable design hope like see nothing volcano biome lack variety items generation quest still game large cast monsters lot became pets even mounts music okay best generic worst items regionlocked means get region obtained reset controversial choice bother accept challengein summary cube world game sure potential great adventure specially coop tends hit miss title newcomers still solid game relax boot want feel adventurous little session gamingjust give try cube world good game almost concept current buggy playable bugs encountered playing game werent gameplay bugs technical bugs lot issues fullscreen cursor set perfect resolution cursor would locked certain section screen even happened correct resolution times game would also sometimes open wouldnt display matter many times alttabbed clicked icon taskbar open task manager many times short time game fix bugs ill definitely buy cube world good game however full potential wollay sharing bits pieces systems features years cube world however release game fairly barei find gameplay fairly directionless apart one option going towards zone objective right anticipate wollay add features eventually world needs systems content available even alpha im uncertain wollay took path changing base game everybody loved something untested audience betai would recommend cube world current state cube world good game everyones stuck development history review bombing final product different alpha version thats available yearsthe value proposition game someone easily spend hours single character classes class specializations fantastic well worth iti purchased game feel quality product indie dev duothis game needs updates tweaks performance optimization sure nearly every game released last yearsthat said game still better metric tons shovelware infinitybetas get released platformstldr good indie game needs updates performance hatetrain fad run

difficuult find problems even easier enemies buut quickly fade awawy gameplay cube world great game amazing potential starting players like confusing especially way questing works think hate exaggerated good game cube world lot fun running around exploring world blast game runs smooth looks amazing new design choices developer made really bad everyone making leveling alpha grindy took forever new system run around explore see monster current gear kill move grind worth well since drop gear usually one tier higher arethe game perfect means need small changes like maybe making artifacts useful adding maybe small stat increases well stats already added like strength way slowly feel like getting stronger also tutorial would nice get people startedgear region locked found regions start getting gear used surrounding regions helps lot get next area startedbut based everything would rate game currently stands lot enjoyment far beta continue cube world much improved game alpha well worth price tag regionlocking isnt big deal much reviews make several hours havent come close finishing starting region even gear exists take surrounding regions ingame lore quests much better alpha enjoy talking npcs learn region overall game definitely worth price tag cube world really particular simple game allows play character chosen different race different set skills depending class chosen stays really simple rightleft clic sepcial ability dodge jump quick use object thats basically object glider boat example travel faster cuz going talk journey game travelling directions chasing bosses quest lore parts discover artifactartifacts symbol level cuz yes xp bar xp drop sad bright side universe game high colours monstersanimals yes sorry categ u need loot particuliar style graphics even ingame mechanics u either love hatei loved fun cube world simple fun action game collect loot explore portions lands gradually become stronger game decent enough loop within starts incredibly hard punishing ignore difficulty monsters ramps quickly near completion areaonce move new land gear becomes essentially useless restart progress though certain bonuses maintain area area form relics certain weapons equipment carried used different areassome people might find gameplay fun might find collecting loot fun might enjoy exploring different lands biomes see world offer might repetitive restarting cycle gathering gear new area something dont personally appreciate seems like simple solution gear scaling problem one heavily punishes players makes gear rewards feel less significantoverall though still enjoyable game enjoyed either solo group though id recommend latter wish bit depth character building gear progression wasnt punitive entering new land core game still enjoyable loop aesthetic absolutely adorable stands among voxel based titles cube world unique rpg game different mechanics work wonderfully way game plays beautiful design good see devs stuck guns far kept way like good cube world unique spin open world rpgs considering development cycle doubtful receive major updates future hope got alot potential exploring friend justifies modest price tagpros combat fun different classes feel unique make replayable cons landscape bland region locked gear sucks wish took different approach cube world amazing core systems reword original alpha

cooping friends nontheless clearly acceptable personally advice saving money different game cube world like lie world cube world showed much promise years ago picked alpha still shows promise today however way wollay chooses develop game ignore criticism community unlikely major concerns players addressed progression meaningless build game region locking gear items severely restricts amount growth feel character artifacts get completing zone almost feel like slap face giving thinks like bonus swim speed light radius never really feel like anything makes stronger worse yet almost feels pointless trying progress would fine cant even play game exploration walking simulator due boat glider also region lockedtons teased content cut game tons existing features mechanics straight removed think point cube world either saved modding community die release really wanted like game inconsistency developer updates meaningless progression lack devcommunity interaction unaddressed complaintscriticisms shallow gameplay loop couldnt bring play couple hourswould recommend purchasing game current state cube world supposed beautiful game dev made many changes youre pretty starting new game time travel region includes whole equipment exploration items cant simply level need kill bunnies one star mobs hope itll drop better equipment otherwise simply cant get way better stats may luck traders meh levels gained completing dungeons finding artifacts one artifact one level sadly give bonuses example swimming speed nothing combat related opinion totally worth doubt itll ever change cube world amazing back alpha even better folks struggle get used new progression system heart adventure exploration game progression system amazing incintevizing exploration super fun game

many know claim fame current beta version many overhauls core gameplay addition new content features great improvements many feel like big steps backward get meat things id like clear review subject

found beginning nearly naked makes getting equipment power difficult even enemies tier weapon rating demolish quickly without xp system guarantee steady progress mercy rng drops however begin gather items noticeably higher drop rate high quality gear alpha even laying around random places explore meaning essentially jump straight brutal struggle steamrolling everything path would werent fact net incentive kill anything longer without xp motivator becomes lot easier justify simply avoiding groups enemies travels since unlikely theyll drop anything useful anyway especially get fully geared upwhile collecting magic items movement items scattered across land randomly doesnt take long collect feels easy opinion still fun buying shops though realize crossing border whatever land found renders useless biggest gripe players point included fact sense progression alpha nonexistent beta currently stated frustrating grind point effectively fight things almost easy get powerful enough kill anything path expected clear area go next start scratch power cut back rather scaling enemies match feels dirty collecting items time change lands gets extremely repetitive fast entire map revealed start convenient also makes exploration dull excitement alpha approaching land border anticipating next biome might gone easy instead chart path blitz unique biome exhausting unique scenery unnaturally quicklywhen initially purchased cube world back things mystified excited prospects gear customization skill treesi never seen voxel game could build weapons adding cubits piece piece

progression start new character notice change immediately relics suck need bettertldr dont buy game needs major updates modding needs take unsatisfying mechanics balance issues cube world good game love things could changed think xp bar needs came back instead getting xp per kill could buffed like xp per kill zones need changed loosing stats go different zone really sucks feels like grinding good gear put wast could make zones harder zones zone gear could scaled gear zone got still stats still kill things easily think would better going zone loosing stats another thing need bring back skill tree add skills class balance class good one cube world great game minor issues cube world explorationfocused roguelike action rpg progression cube world based gear valid region obtained case items appended name adjacent regions permanent progression cube world based special artifacts find end small adventures region writing artifacts serve minor quality life buffs ultimately minor buffs bestowed artifacts major problem game regionlocked gear makes progression exploration rewarding across regions think artifacts actually make difference characters power feel meaningful rather arbitrary overall think excellent game play solo friends extremely good value price cube world great game gets repetitive quickly region locked gear problem finding special items hang glider spirit bell divine harp ect gets bit annoying find artifact must get lore difficult leave wondering around bit overall game fun experience even fun friends cube world lot like girl dated back thenat first

fulfilling single promise made keeping around money cube world nice chill game play grindy fun cube world means perfect easy dont know going die lot get basics still die due either bad decisions even possible lag game rather cpu intensive timesi hope game continues updated blast play explore feels like missing something like classes weapon item variants abilities much great way spend time hours pretty good pcand yes many reviews talk alpha personally never got copy know feel version quite different direction heading back alpha levels skill trees many things made world personal time played sadly however thats past devs whether get see interesting features future really hope looked amazing anyone elseso give cube world fun issues many things people looking forward missing cube world seems passion project developed creators mind since child taking inspiration various iconic games notably zelda cube world throws extremely large open world lots great featuresthe great combat fun interesting times challenging concept simply running wilderness finding adventures well implemented animations sounds art direction come together extremely satisfying experience software runs freaking well ways havent seen game flying one side map everything loads instantly smoothly start running around straight away pausing objects load moving around fighting player npc animations smooth fast well feels really really nicethe bad cannot get multiplayer connect seconds classes quite unbalanced moment make sure play water mage playing solo enough unique content keep interested beating multiple zones im sure issues change near future none make second guess purchasing game great one play cube world used game held close played nearly daily years back changes made past year feels like complete promised us dont get wrong game concept great optimization alright voxelgraphics nice isnt cube world promised anymoreif wollay really loves appreciates community followed throughout listening complaints fixing things accordingly even reverting systems wouldnt problemi change review something positive happens point think unlikely update looks like wollay took money ran game abandoned cube world advertised procedurally generated endless exploration rpg inspired legend zelda diablo world warcraftthe alpha beta delivered different waysthe core differences sticking point lot people alpha brought infinite progression leveling system killed things pretty much way gain xp leveled gained skill points could either put towards combat abilities exploration abilities first unlocking improving could also improve combat gear power requirementstats consisted mostly traditional rpg stats different names tempo instead hasteattack speed pretty standard stuff power overall summation characters performance creating character would create world via seed dropped first zone would based level surrounding zones radiating would generally increase level range difficulty progressed level cap new regions enemies progressed along thus game could theoretically continue endlessly pretty much occasionally would encounter dungeons region usually castle pyramid sort also overworld bosses basically larger regular enemies damage sponges could easily beat boss minutes quests consisted random npcs pointing dungeon overworld boss thats itthe full release thematically goes things different way also providing lot structure previously moving new zone encouraged begin killing looking loot gain levels gear increase power level new version arbitrary levels power removed instead scaling infinitely strength reset upon entering new zoneyou need quest gather new gear particular zone still gear past zones free use upon returning zoneb people upset change different fail see surface level changes u end youre basic thing setups u exploring zone completing objectives improve performance zone move another zone gather gear complete objectives improve performance bon top release version changes improvements offer lot structure alpha world unique player created based seed full release uses seed everyone may seem like downgrade large world near infinite ever really issue bonus sharing seed making multiplayer easier alpha needed decide players seed wanted explore host simply matter getting friends location joiningthis improved consistency also allows structured quests quest go kill thing variety could rescuing trapped npc avenging town thats turned stone killing evil witch stopping power hungry faction pumping mana ground huge contraptions top youre finding tomes crypts tell lore area simplistic honest gives context theme areas explorethe complaint ive seen among alpha players believe merit region locking mobility items youre able increase ability traverse lands via riding pets boat hanglider well able climb without stamina loss spiked boots like combat gear items locked region must reacquired zone frustrating crossing border suddenly methods transport youve getting used gone without encouraged find youre sailing across area great speeds youre likely find well exploration rewards never lost youd much likely miss things subsequent regions thus slowing progression causing frustration regardless mind restriction minimaltldr summaryif youre type loves exploring procedurally created open worlds simple tight responsive combat youll enjoy game put numerous hours alpha currently full release genuinely enjoy game solo fun rewarding playing coordinating friends even better majority people upset game firmly believe simply resistant change things different norm also think overly fixated levels justify time theyve put game really arbitrary number doesnt mean anything general im linear levels system dont find realistic lazy representation character progression done decades people understand gets job done though many critics game would believe otherwise fun rewarding games dont rely levels stats zelda prime examplei admire developers trying something even little different think game deserves time cube world game us waiting forever finally doesnt take long see different game previously first bit turned changed view point game longer rpg mmo style grind mobs kind game adventure game like zelda explore stronger get amass good collection gear slowly conquer world love new iteration game love see wollay continues work gameps go play water biome rewarded handsomely cube world current state reminds lot mans sky upon release landscapes amazing fun explore first hours fun moving region youre feels terrible gear worthless lose glider boat saddle things youve collected reward reseting comes form artifacts laughably bad lamp brightness swimming speed minor stat boost barely affects gameplay skill tree wont gain new abilities playing early game consisted case draggin mobs groups friendly adventurers kill hopes getting gear early power balance awful youre either getting one shot youre one one shottingi cant recommend game current state progressing game feels bad youve beaten zone two theres nothing pushing keep going cube worlds steam release sees revamped exploration loop consisting exploring mapped region visiting new bordering region update support fully supporting exploration removing complexity grinding stat progression cube world fully supports exploration expanded rooster environments dungeons much refined product cost removing features could expanded enhance game look forwards future updates enjoyed alpha steam release enough make ti worth money spenti recommend cube world exploration game decently interesting combat aspect cubeworld voxel based openworld rpgbut shouldnt expect action rpg like othercube world got differences equipment sticks specific areas except gear much rare cant level killing monster need search artifacts increase stats character like climbing speed pet riding speed gliding speed morein expirience multiplayer coop working good bit laggyfun game start every days play around minutesim doubtful game updated regularly cubeworld ha like cuteworld uwu cubeworld purchased alpha back personally enjoyed update bare mind serious gameplay issues main thing progression completing region feels underwhelming especially artifacts dont really give good perks bonuses levelling alpha removed little upsetting grinding isnt really thing anymore game could definitely first time player features help time felt self googling simplest things overall found cubeworld enjoyable experience need fixes gameplay really could adjustments give developer chance listen reviews address cubeworld great base sadly cut short locking progress regions game makes sense progression take constant steps back pretty sad compared alpha quests events expanded made feel alive progress locking ultimately makes worse game alpha personally feel still worth pricetag gets rework progression however clear yes cubeworld relaxed rpg lots adventure fun intense fighting want love game bit world super fun cute totally recommend game anyone everyone cubeworld maybe best recent case shouldnt go situation previous expectations perhaps shouldnt always trust opinions othersthe gameplay loop still exists alpha say still kill enemies get loot still exploring map delving dungeons youll collecting items craft potions gear wont dealing time gated ability gain feeling like youve beaten entire game fully clearing single zonea lot people complaining work gone reality added greatly gameplay loop offers reason explore one area yes gear early help new zone items finding priority youll need amass lore clear dungeonspeople hating system foreign im tell game still fun explore loot upgrade components havent gone anywhere anything iteration given lasting power dont buy hype often itll burn cubeworld brilliant experience based leveling rpg set world cubes alpha recent update diverts classical rpg experience instead rely completely armour weapon stats completely ditch experience points played original cubeworld alpha different experience one may become used however mean bad experience one unaccustomed time spent looking crafting buying new armour weapons find conquering first biome collecting first relics point find another divergence original game moving across border biomes hide items collected far except resources relic upgrades point need start build characters items equipment conquer new biome progress world cubeworld review two partspart paranoid region locked equipment illconceived mechanic didnt work way dev wanted part paranoid region locked equipment method finish game without actually create rpg content decide dont cause point game isnt worth paying even worth playing free final word disappointment current cube world feels like get dropped world guidance impossible know unless look horrible progression curve currently cant recommend game anyone current state game improvedissues currently others also resolved change review currently worth price prealpha release quite shady move developer want game consider wait proper update currently played almost played time partner honestly played game hardcore yearsour first region rough idea id love see tutorial type stuff fabled gear seems way rare needs craftable something besides pretty happyour main concern game current system enjoy definitely everyone minority id like see transparency devs linear progression alongside already havewatch videos game purchase minority isnt bothered regions recommend game currently would recommend unless changes madethe game play loop understandable point get lot gutted initial release would understand got power downgrade till accomplished something new zone quite maybe full reset power along fact character never improves way using normal attacks ultimate improvements changes whole game add taking away mobility zone glider riding boat climbing gloves talk every npc without knowing tell new quests lot tedium real permanent reward benefits getting artifacts mobility items improvements unusable soon enter new zone things tweaked even removed tweaked would say could recommendable know full game yet things need addressed content added consider worth currently game play limitedi feel like game could one region nothing else dont feel like im exploring new world everything set disappointed character leveling lacks customization overall feels like empty copy paste experiencei like small features like abilities classes fun float sorcerer feel empty playing game lackluster think would help creator would used couple years bounce feedback players get take instead kept developer bubble cute colourful game lots potential really good since made people game development work people realise especially building game enginewhile development may slow due amount people working game recommend cute fun easy grab play friends solo love character art disclaimer review based upon beta build although updates game bugfixesi loved game alpha would like tell still case unfortunately game really enjoyable anymore lose everything change zones understand sake exploration problem taking stuff away players feels absolutely terrible players try think another game takes gear way cant come one sure hope game receives major changes would love enjoy playing iti know wollay spent long time making passion project happy see come fruition disappointed direction gone wollay please listen community love game want see amazing beas game definitely fun hours go next area shit hits fan also main progression system tied blue purple stats glidingsailing speed light radius get artifact stats increase problem cant benefit upgrades unless items required use even increase stats via artifacts like supposed dont benefit find item needi would recommend game anyone looking hours fun although much gameplay bit steep anyone cares project would like see happens ui would stay away u personally following game since early alpha sticking around hopes things turn better dont buy itits cash grab idea got steam first place got like years ago instead adding features removed got steam milk money people believe lies pathetic dont buy game make sure get somewhere dev wont compensated totally screwed game gave empty promises mods thing make game fun damn wollay destroyed game alphapros infinite world smooth performancecons skill trees anymore ability upgrades anymore progression glider boat anything else unlock one land locked land difficulty jumps lose progress every new land enterim really sure game entirely changed alpha already pretty decent bought alpha loved received beta key due picroma account alpha purchased asking absurd dont buy game worth price game isnt fun used wasnt upset wollay disappearing giving updates years im disappointed fact updated game something different damn thought wasted years wait sale orwait game completely reworked stops fun hours dashed hopes dreams game dear wollayi wrote soon found could publish language reflects game released yet internet feral place grasp shield youre storm tactful hate lot people played alpha loved iti played alpha lot idea infinite progression beautiful figured youd able build system make worthwhile keep going keep exploring instead removed old system decided add artifacts give permanent stat increases secondary stats really arent worth grinding fordont take criticism malice instead look saying game loop missing something keep interested maybe collect artifact choose bonus goes limited secondary stats character power building core game play mechanic every rpg however dont let power zone zone force players reacquire gear every land dont give power make worth keep going dont really care climbing speed boat travel speed sorryi love new travel systems one thing probably able happen make people able travel friends clicking needing bird also able travel directly towns center instead hoof seconds get bird every time want teleport friendgood luck look forward seeing changes additions make future dear wollayyour game got issues regionlocking skilltree leveling grind regionlock could better really want game could need clear region going next one complete region gear equipped gets take next region could regions require cercent level personally would go remove regionlock really takes away grind loved alpha game exploring skilltree nice could build character way wanted play spells default changing two classes isnt really intriguing since already added new spells class could made big skilltrees variety different skills different class leveling makes sense want artifacts game atleast give worthy stat swimming stamina boatspeed hangglidingspeed etc useless dosent reward player alli hyped liked first hours gameplay every since gone downhill game isnt fun straigth boring thought people kind dumb saying alpha better take opinion back alpha better beta sorry fucked upeverything needed make game good waskeep alpha add things added beta comes quests ended broken game real boring getting legendary dosent really feel rewarding get gameplay game dosent feel like grinding full legendary set gameplay isnt grind tbh really wouldnt recommend game anyone buy atm bad fixed decent challenge beautiful world passing borders renders items useless get decent game maybe worth full price ever goes sale would good price played alpha version maybe hours forgotten completely playing steam versionoverall game simple price world shallow lacks enough varied content make want fight different biomes regions game focused exploration isnt really much see enjoyable experience hours realize enough content keep goinggraphics atmosphere cube world charming graphics music endearing games emulated style game really nails npcs monsters landscape joy look wish varied npcs types towns however might explored biomes yet coastalocean region cool pirate towns opposed normal towns forest biomes music great game goes great classic osts like chrono triggergamplay combat probably best aspect game overall simple unbalanced warrior probably best class tree simple enough depth keep things interesting example warriors balance mp rage meter stamina block power bar stun lock moves classes simple focus pure damage dps ranged classes probably strong exploit large enemies hiding bridges entrance ways wish combo counter played bigger role combat gear little bit important combat would like skill based combat elements like stuns shouldnt based purely random chance done right time stun increased damage boss enemies basically dps fests arent really tactics strategies needed chug potions keep swinging warrior cool tricks block mechanics classes need kite attempt facetankdodge stamina runs trying get stun procas core gameplay loop hunt artifacts boost exploration skills horde gear items used surrounding regions exp bar tradtional sense leveling combat progression gear based based skill start game hard playing hours potions knowhow easily kill monster tiers gear level bigger issues major balance issues early game classes seems weaker less synergistic others example early game hard get starting gear guides recommend kitting blue tier mobs friendly ai kill pick loot kiting mobs respawn point dying spamming ultimate move slowly damage kill game also fair number bugs items spawning like glider nowhere found enemy ai generally dumb easily getting stuck walls handle different concept leveling dont mind losing gear going new region game decently fun play could use events types towns monsters big quest chains factions decent game took get best friends decidedly worth wait bought back developer ghosted long time honestly feel better wasnt great elements became favorite parts breath wild climbing gliding exploration etc truly shame definitely lot playtime incoming fun friendseditafter months change negative patches anything promised launch dev went full silence mode definitely asks much money fun action rpg get somewhat stale hours highly suggest getting sale definitely worth buy people angery get waht exactly wanted take fact masterpiece game developed two people thats insane sure would need tweaks fixes current characterdevelopment system around sweet game think worth support wolfram von funck believe brings us many great updates future enjoy stay crazy world cubez despite hate know buying great game none less despite trash thrown game justified tho still think enough care devolper game still saved loved game younger since great sure return past glory even rise even despite many issues would still recommend game good qualities believe still worth checking currently hours gamethere already many reviews touch key points also since received key alpha player didnt buy steam review doesnt count anyway towards overall review score valve policy fault picroma going use opportunity pitch personal suggestions improve game case devs go looking sort constructive feedbackwhat would personally improve gameplaytake kingdoms lore read make real actual borders would uncover discover lore tablets make encompass multiple zones certain gear would lock would greatly extend loop gameplay could venture several zones start overnot gear needs kingdom locked higher tiered gear id say purpleyellow maybe blue lower tiered gear could carried freely kingdoms penaltymake gear craft finding books locked kingdom also bring back dropped recipes find make single use lock whatever kingdom craft inmake world quest either progressed completed collecting certain number artifacts saving certain number kingdoms additionally wanted add progressive difficulty make worlds difficulty increase incrementally kingdom savedincrease region size double least make connected biomes type one region stated several regions part larger kingdommake world bit less archipelago continents landlocked regionsspread movement tools around world bit necessarily one every region balance allow locked kingdom give value locateadd storage stash system pass along gear charactersfinally would add vendor kingdom hefty price unlock piece gear locked another kingdom bind current one would sometimes worth since higher tiered gear would locked especially trouble finding would also give point passing gear players would give gold additional value despite reviews game still relatively enjoyable play hope community creator come compromise regarding region lock cool idea maybe implemented strange way super fun play though despite general consensus find get initial bump understanding ui ends quite fun play theres always something find explore gear item upgrade boss beatcertainly comparable alpha slightly different ways seem infuriated community despite reviews saying mobs difficult actually think game good much fun however recommend playing friend despite many people felt entitled think game lot fun ive definitely gotten worth fun game enjoy sprawling map make regions various biomes explore castles underground dungeons mines fricking borg etc fantastic run sure learning curve thats part appeal real penalty death best way learn keep playing granted quality life changes id like arent deal breakers means im able jump friends worlds mine seemlessly quick flight path im able play explore friends awesome understand thought going get rpg half decade ago action adventure game pretty awesome lot cleverness theres room grow despite people saying game really great already even tho monsters oneshot theres like higher level allies kill xp skill tree gone doesnt stop changed separate classes like rouge assassins ninjas neat plains gorgeous look around even night time scary roam could find rockling beating mess overall despite hate highly recommend game wants experience feels like low become broken character start gets boring soon hit new regionheres thing would say game nothing really poor reviews see game basicly funny ridiculous people treating game triple game developed people people would expect give game free create game mmorpg game single playermultiplayeroptional gave ups downs literally everything arsenal provide want get top tier gears company would sponsors game would see game better place due stupendous gaming community expecting game full gameto would go hours game wouldnt recommend reading reviews basicly scan game bias intent either hate game going away years expecting game triple game final product people saying ghosted despite people say mods stop region locking thing improve game little give try would suggest buying goes sale dev cash grab back like years ago trying grab money steam peeps dont buy game dev dissapeared yet againi want like gamei want funi want waste thousands hours exploring game offerbut hours ive played game times overthere less content version old alphaand even terrain generation looked amazing vibrant alpha version bland flat mehi want love thisi cant makes sad dev releases first version us early backers years ago vanishes returns years later completely dumbed version steam release vanishes againwith development cycle lack communication like really cannot recommend assume nothing cash grab dev seems ghosted official release including deleted cube world blog expect updates near far future game near unplayable state right way enjoy get lucky start arent spawned legendary enemies dungeons minute one even progress youve made disappear moving one region next gear reverted gray quality moment leave region obtained get rare equipment retains quality bordering regions still lose value walk another region away origination point items may even class lose everything else youve obtained including mobility items glider reins pet matter artifacts would possibly remedied situation increase stats move speed around diminishing returns swim speed climb speed lantern radius none actually particularly useful dev spent years alpha release broke fundamentals really hope hes trying make right wont change review till alpha game really fun thoedit alpha beta smart developer abandoned game hell probably blame players like usual expect update four years game back released least fun back didnt require mod enjoyed developer basically spent last years stripping away nearly everything made game good begin beyond theres almost new content compared alpha feels like cashgrab developer currently talk community games obvious major issues many simple fixes currently make progression worth time good developers disappear day game even releases first time done community cant really give review based alonethe game well worth bucks pocket change youll hours fun based game alone developers act recommend game developper made quick cash disapeared game potential feels heavily unfinished would recommend devs ghosted community years community payed game praised released version game broke good things alpha hadnope nope one everyone devs removed windows support explanation alpha content messthe game ready release diamond rough tweaks could see region lock idea working edit mods disable region lock tweak liking though tbh felt like sense progression stronger alpha due skills locked behind levels enjoy progression elements game like region locks lot bugs including one prevented even able click start game one point hoping maybe would fixed seems creator deleted everything moved dont get refund late play game earlier bought directly release already played hours love game design problem suddenly play game start game appear system tray click window game crashes closes immediately already reinstalled game checked corrupt files restarted pc rebooted timesmaybe someone help would nice different imagined im disappointed good differently worth playing right disappointing feels barebones alpha could still pretty good game decent updates expect get lack communication wollay leading beta release incredibly frustrating doesnt bode well games futuretwo changes would drastically improve game larger regions size regular regions scaling past stars make artifacts give either cool effects like legendaries risk rain combatmovement stats instead garbage like light radiusdont buy worth appropriate given state disappointing nothing like alpha made great sincerely hope patched like alpha later update disappointing could least little bit hope dev would update would wait refund right im certain left untouched devs would run away money like years ago disappointment powerful enough word describe disclaimer alpha owner got early access based experiences versionas much want sing praises game simply cannot bought years ago played crap beta enjoyed heck decided wait patiently whatever news came fateful day twitter happened wollay said would release steam literally cheered available sadly different gamewhat personally paid years ago rpg skill trees progression incarnation skill trees progression lost everytime go new region save artefacts give minor bonuses gear worked worth nothing next area may able keep quality gear nearby zones become worthless eventuallythen fact alpha playable windows first said store page well without word windows removed system requirements without word developer rely fan made patch add missing dll files works finewhat happened wollay first started sell game horrible getting ddosed morale shattered sucks promised first bought gamei sadly cannot reccomend state best luck wollay best luck disclaimer kinda rant dont wanna read lot go bottom conclusionsooo like many others also pretty disappointed polished promising alpha great potential entirely different repetitive game came tbh ithe gameplay bad also needs polish like actual reward going diffrent biomes every biome feels like started new game compared alphaso even though heard bad reviews beta willing give shot loved alpha much spend hours hours travelling villages leveling pretty nice already added variations skills weapons class one first things noticed fun leveling removed skills already way upgrade choose paths liked leveling aspect whole rpg feel thats bummer however worst thing die happens often repawn shrine previously activate therefore find even map difficult

unplayabletheyve changed game much isnt expecting thats worst part took game know love flipped upside disappointing dogshit update alpha better dont buy game wants roguelike plays like exploration based rpg fails dont buy state needs lots updates worth pricetag bought game way back years ago loved dont get wrong game playable way gameplay loop wrong first zones fun reward isnt big enoughthat isnt reason saying shouldnt buy game im saying high possibility creator wollay played us well people bought game new found hype fools making game buyable building hype getting initial sales giving project againi hope isnt true hes letting storm calm time tell dont buy wait years next big update invest dont buy get hours fun max becomes tedious repetetive walk search simulator talk npcs small

roadmap official website inform fans massive changes game told us reworked existing thingsthe beta comes alpha buyers play itmost good things alpha removed destroyed generation world simplyfied lvling system completely removed whole skillsystem basically get close full reset every new region go without feeling real progress afterwardsthis sad imo wouldnt hard make great game alpha especially years development time guess main problem communication playerbase dev devs fault doesnt seem like got better communicating yearsin end say feel like dev didnt even play game hours otherwise would seen obvious easy fix flaws game dont buy itnot worth dont buy expecting like game played back alpha took everything liked gutted reworked game something clearly inspired openworld games like breath wild theres basically leveling region locking makes game awful compared used bealso let us mention fact wollay main developer cannot trusted vanished face earth alpha phase suspiciously quiet past week may took money ranupdate lmao fucking joke took money ran away glad didnt spend money game filthy scum like dev doesnt deserve anything dont buy game current state incredibly poorly designed instead pirate alpha version superior gameif game alpha added content would happy hours playing game cant bring play anymore cant find reason tothe game development years since released alpha barely added anything stated website going addduring time beta wollay acknowledged criticism development never hinted changing core gameplay completelythe game promote exploring region locking gear meaning step outside border current region gear becomes useless cant ride mount use boat use glider meaning start everytime want explore new areasa complex skill tree promised removed skill tree completely skills beginning meaning never get incredible feeling increasing powerthe progression game absolutely horrible reward get clearing entire region artifact might increase light radius increase gliding speed xp anymore fighting mobs encouraged unless need gold way bossi like added quests new skills music good tooyou dont increase power steady pace absolutely useless early game getting wrecked llamas dogs depending class continue getting wrecked get good weapon drop game jokemore classes playable races promised none added even new hairstylesstay clear game dont buy game seriouslygo get crack old vesion way funseem like woolay run money shat piece get dont buy game probably already know dev unreliable takes years post updates even news game general deaf player feedback lot fun alpha back days forsaken broken piece software terrible game design decisions lack proper support isnt worth time money spent gamedev actually takes care gamecommunity dont buy game cash grab developers gives much content repeats worth anything dont buy game worth money wont funding development youll giving old man wife money dont deserve putting enough work technically show game really must wait sale knock price buck dont buy got worse time development im sure developer actually lot work went wrong direction almost nothing except remove important things add new content changes make game less fun less fun would even consider pointless theres really lot game good things already beforei didnt refund sole purpose satisfying nostalgia time time hopes new updates ever happen dont buy dev speaks like years dont come game expecting alpha version took get used zone based mechanics hours completely fine hours later im still fun cant wait hop friend take legendary demon boss hard solo please ignore alpha beta haters unless course logical complaint think fun game considering buy game would recommend hit want coop dont dudes worth wollay doesnt deserve money disappearing six years deliver game less content alpha dont even bother huge difficulty spike soon start game seems like thing explore get punished dont expect updates buy cant recommend current state years im really disappointed dont get game updated since release theres really much content game developer abandoned game soon released save money something better dont know came mind wollay decided make changes made alpha absence exp whatsoever exp character whos described level stats time lead think unlock sort levelling class skills maybe progression acquiring better gear upgrading already owned equipment crafting better stuff accessed magic crafting books acquiring artifacts enhance travelling skills character class progression choosing invest level points garbage one previously mentioned features alpha absent release class progression makes everything shallow pointless feel earning skills hard workregion locked gearitems one makes going beyond starting region frustrating youve already probably acquired top tier gear useful items boat glider reins etc none regions like starting scratch beside artifacts gained wow sail faster regions started first one another thing upgrading weapons alpha gems used add specific attributes weapons thing adding iron cubes basic shape selected weapons increase damage another change made game even dull seas used full life empty water algaeall features combined make going beyond first area pointless important regions justify stuff worked previous hours least nothing time youve done everything important first region game dead seriously years get really tried best impartial playing hours even disagreeing reviews really harsh towards game completing starting region beside bugs got way core mechanics say wollay wasted six years idea great full potential players expressing preferences almost fully customize characters gear something lifespan triple game hours nothing im really disappointed first time supported many alpha releases say could go back time wouldnt purchased game first placewollay last comment meant addressed directly youi totally think cube world needs reworking needs something alpha artifact hunting levelling nice like probablyjacob stated video youtube gives indiana jones feel pretty new unheard games artifacts granted power increasing mere level stat travelling speeds artifacts unlocking precious skill levels points attribute points travelling speed upgrades features either clustered artifact scattered various kinds classes artifacts randomizing binding type artifact specific benefit specific type location let players able tell first glance whether dungeon theyre going explore suits need characters keeping old alpha skill level progression features like deep weapon customization spirit gems armor customization would nice tooi dont really get developer could use years enrich game scraping feature feature leaving result barren tasteless really dont get dont know say people havent already fun game region locking removal xp system skill tree ruined dont let negative reviews make get game extremely fun charming dont let alpha testers fool youre discovering cube world first time fantastic piece work one good single player adventure games dont let playtime fool played numerous hours alpha years years ago features charm replaced walking simulator core gameplay loop exploration actively punishes exploring taking away tools boatsglider weapons bother exploring new land lose everything process like theres story enjoy loop attempting explore losing everything ive earnedits worth looking developers twitter history see numerous features seemingly tore game around cities better looking world generation factions im sure much cant arsed dig brings back painful memories could worth buy right theres potential wollay reverts changes listens people supported begin dont listen hype game still great fun multiplayer experience dont trust reviews mad game different alpha removed content replaced different content works differently recommend trying refunding dont like personally love dont waste timeits sad true alpha years ago significantly better progression ability explore without punished either become powerful never leave birth place leave birth place forever doomed weakest new land encountered say weak mean oneshot beetle weak tediously weak point hunt rabbits roaming land hoping find slowly youll become strong enough take beetle eventually youll raid castleand explore new lands well fool prepared start hunting rabbits least glider boat say wrong prepared reunlock everything every new locationand least play friends say well friend seconds behind time disconnecting times youve google life thus far yes multiplayerstay clear stay clear dont listen pleps dont know nothing went game played hours like different give negative rating sad game awesome fun hours game least played hours days tells love side region lock dont like easy fix go google get mod remove big problemthe game

conversion mod available pulls large list community requested features otherwise wait deep sale drastically different alpha versionstill great game would even better different progression systemmaybe keep different movement items biomes better perks clearing areas dreams come true drop world see bunch enemies across mostly flat mostly featureless terrain kill gain two coins time repeat wonder game hiding fun shut offsome sort hook beginning tell player go greatly needed players shouldnt look guides enjoy gamethe funny moment leading slime inside sewer town watching like npcs couldnt inflict damage least hopelessly outmatched dude game like rogue like play like rogue like games basically stripped everything good game due alpha good extent way approach going new region believe changed due enemies face next region tap levelling system helps combat dumbed combat progression systemall gear reset everytime leave map region including items like boat yeah boat desintegrate feet becouse traverse invisible lineno form permanent progression edit october recent development cube world modding community certain mod maker managed salvage game actually make game enjoyable play game mod game fine mod removes dreadful region locked gear items adds scaling mobs gear improves artifacts allows turn pvp adjusts item drop rates however still dont recommend buy game simply dont think support
