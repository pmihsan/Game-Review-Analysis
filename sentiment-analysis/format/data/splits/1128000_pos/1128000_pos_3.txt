start scratch start zerothere however one thing carries one region another fact bound character artifacts artifacts monkeys paw would kinda cool game able somehow make wish game ends cursing wish gives sort punishment something like artifacts cube world sort main goal game youre supposed collect artifacts might ask theyre elaborate complex monkeys paw dont increase attack speed give fire damage lifesteal grant necromantic powers allow raise zombies skeletons artifacts cube world provide permanents stats bound character increase movement stats sailing speed climbing speed swimming speed riding speed diving speed even lamp radius lamps toggled f key provide small light radius around character active small amount example start meter lamp radius start artifacts boost lamps light radius meter radius thats cool rewarding right youve spent couple hours gearing questing adventuring region end road got bonus meter light radius lampthis fun game needs revamp alpha version game good basis leveling system really emphasised character progression somehow years development current game feels emptier shallower previous version game game couldve much wollay listened wollay talked dont think anyone wished happeni recommend game current state edit seen absolutely z e r discussion wollay changes trying improve game hope would something improve experience far ive seen none something changes im going negativeend editi enjoy game really needs worki dont mind concept region locking gear dont even oppose removal experience game needs system gear locking needs reworking artifacts made less worthless less like improved exploration stats actuality dont expect get experience level becoming broken become stronger finish region gear becomes worthless rest usually make sure watch video know youre getting im giving positive review hours say enough im horribly disappointed lack community acknowledgement lots people plenty good ideas yet seemingly zero recognition edit thanks modders mods remove stupid region locking gear improve drop rates scaling ect make game bit fun closer believe people want regardless doesnt fix game still stand mentioned review thus revised allthis review hopefully publicise feedback devs provide believe constructive criticism aid development gamecube world love child zelda minecraft know everyone makes comparison pretty truecube world large open world rpg game voxel graphics mainly focuses questing explorationthe map huge theres lot quests get cute pets help battle game looks niceso whats missinga lot like lotcube world moment feels like suffers huge sandbox enough sand fill awfully large world run around explore theres actually lot inside theres dungeons scattered around random enemies spend time running away actually fighting quests usually high level clutter map teasing bits pieces lore towns youll spend minutes leave thats movement feels nice floaty plenty control wish sprinting wasnt class exclusive getting around places hella slow teleport shrines life discover thats activate exploring new areas takes ages hang glider bit whack wont get far unless get really high airnow biggest gripes areequipment localised map segmented different areas unique biomes extensions said biomes whatever reason enter one new areas equipment including key items locked region found could maybe see someone would implement think utterly stupid design makes already slow progression even slower leveling skills dont exist make assumptions removed functionality removal pretty bad really hope system refurbished reimplemented skill system maybe perks levels existing makes character progression feel kinda lackluster due limited equipment mentioned bound region find starting really slow dont know well bit unlucky solo multiplayer found trying get new gear actually challenge tougher enemies dungeons quite slow made feel like running around exact stuff considering ive played hours time review id say kinda disappointing saying id like see lot things things ive mentionedsmother progression transition higher level content leveling added provide way properly gauge content player tackling provide extra bonuses stats outside armour well wider range low mid tier level enemies dungeons common starting areas perhaps also properly flesh questing system established quest log specific npcs give big quests like bounty board something would work give gold xp rare items andor equipment fill map dungeons enemy camps random buildings explore loot lore something else besides quest locations arenas cool start could find ones doesnt anything someone whos barely cant get much furtherjust misc stuff like improvements hud make menus tidier added sorting features options hide change information displayed around map key items size said hud features imagine already thought devs still want mention casesmoother combat maybe bigger differences alt classes changes buffs certain skills general balancing would nice id imagine something like already considered current state expected change example said changes would like spitball would warrior shift ability sluggish hard transition youre already attacking shield throw would nice long range aggro catcher ranged damage hang glider could retain altitude longer dip much upon start flight could bad gliding feels like large drop intended boat never stops grapple sorts would cool swing gain height glide maybe climbing could bit quicker means suggestions merely suggestions means objective things would like see believe would improve game also suggestions could potentially already considered works devs really really hope see game grow people finally feel like wait worth seeing negative reviews articles bashing game makes upset also understand people feel way however still going

different alpha way added quests objectives feel game requires time effort come great reward alpha straight combat quick lvl full release need find items complete certain missions gain knowledge travelers grind people need give time doubting game well needs balanced im sure update forum discussion pros cons difficult alpha still open world mmorpg made cubes game still looks amazing added lot new things worth say last review worth saying long played wrote longer agree recommending time reasons realize play actually get good armour weapons game becomes easy simple walk different region story really high hopes game seems like years let eh pretty noice friends empty game making player start scratches isnt good way go game lost everything fun enjoyablewould nice little fleshed exploration easier enjoying mess gamethe progression system different rpgs doesnt mean bad ive thoroughly enjoyed game changes made wollay pixxie keep good work certainly grow niche community around indie development one look forward future hope enough said game get would consider game complete advertised like aspects game originally advertised pulled game mechanics abnormal intuitive players isnt exactly main issue extension entire system counter intuitive players incentives contradictory game tells progression system removes progress create infinite loop instead giving player control reset resets games control core issue efforts directly applied characters progression randomness limitations put place remove control turn chore game game epic game im happy saw post twitter telling cube world released steami say kinda forgot tbh saw developer active twitterand downloded play itnearly yearsfeel old yet even years still charming gameit still got lot flaws definetly enjoyable ill play friends lot futureim happy everything lets hope future updates fix ittheres much love game tell even doesnt expected game love game unconditionally good luck wollay even game doesnt best rewarding system still get hooked playing hours even pixelark better progression even tho game basicly got ruined better alpha would actually recommend new gameplay acutally adventure get missions npcs game witch nice even though got free cant recommend itwhile original game lot flaws nice setting could expanded uponwhich happened good waya lot systems worked alpha got butchered game got ditched againdont see point coming back changing main systems game ditching itdisappointed fans twicegame might worth ever sale bucks isnt worth even though heard bad things beta decided pick cube world anyways think fun like gameplay loop going different regions ransacking artifacts like indiana jones sort deal mainly problem minuscule artifact buffs think higher might break game however one thing criticize region lock mostly issue really annoys star gear one region useless another suggestion gear one region isnt completely useless regions example star gear could downgraded star gear depending stats star gear turns star star turns star etc would make actually able defend first enter new region also clarify plus gear would act normal exit plus gears radius downgrades occur another suggestion hanglider boat reigns work way suggestion gear example crossing ocean border boat first region disappear instead becomes slower gains kind debuff way get boat back regular speed get boat region cross region border farther one first crossed boat disappear kinda like plus gear would work hanglider stamina speed debuff reigns ride speed debuff rest region locked gear harp bell flute etc stay work one thing hope things endgame added game basically infinite loop right maybe like new biomes old cut content readded spice gameplay players complete regions also actual story would cool keep player motivated perhaps even ending although would work similar minecraft player still play ending taken consideration believe new version cube world could truly special great many people wishing xp skill trees top region unlocking like game needs reworks system content even though game changed lot compared alpha still believe update straight upgrade fun playhoping see game go future even though reviews pretty rough would still recommend game player alpha beta game enjoyable graphics replayability decent try leave good comment decent criticism instead blatant hatred devs might update better even though restart every region still recommend finish zone find refreshing new zones experience gearing finding items new zones decide explore everthing fun game removedno exploration gear degrades

even enjoy game see whyif looking rpg fight enemies hours get better gear isnt game however like exploring finding items gear friends game perfect exploration quests map system greatthis game could use improvements games hope bad reviews taken good light devs update game everyone happy much possible anyways first game much less features alpha years ago second due gutting much except sit trees farm also nothing tell tells maybe half controls thats options btw see controls thirdly high price tag ridiculous recommend current stage firstly would like begin saying game changed much lot great things new cube world however many bad things added well great finally got cube world feel like cube world feels like cheap skin name cube world thrown top progression wasnt great alpha cube world wasnt bad either new cube worlds progression times worse xp killing mobs creatures almost useless unless need gold mobs drop progression combat also lacking none begin abilities skills nothing improved along way skill trees gone build paths wouldve made cube world little bit interesting gone even gear progression gone start nothing spend precious time gaining star equipment realize whole biome weak youre strong balance even worse cross new biome hard earned items gear weapons become useless rating drops zerothis game longer based skill old cube world could take mightiest bosses poor gear long worked hard skill fight whereas solely based gear alone take bosses complete quests also gear based luck went zone took hours get good gear another zone got full set star gear minutes playtime kind dumb ask end game revolves around collecting artifacts dont much besides give minor sub stat boost riding speed hang glider lantern radius etc half time arent even able use boosts dont items use lose hard earned items crossing border fuck wants go find boat hang glider want explore beautiful world cube world understand special items spirit bell magic harp etc disappearing items helps us get around obtained interesting quest stay us permanentlywollay talks exploration big part game game feels like forced stick one biome complete every single task course dont stay one biome youre progress resets leave probably wont get artifacts within become strong enough could either quick long happen walking big part game spend large chunk playtime walking travelling rather enjoying playing game way game played dont get started repetitive boring quests complete zone may move next one quests tasks things supposed recycled every zone find self thing every zone isnt anything innovative new cube world beta cube world didnt need rework need updated improved new things added barely touched surface issues cube world beta im aware gear believe fix cube worlds region lock want gear stays cross borders biomes scale whomever enters instead everything one shotting u begin remember allowed personalize gear add colored spirit cubes make unique one color useless since use personalized weapons single biomea lot people may experienced friends lagged badly multiplayer whomever hosting session player experiencing perfect gameplay tried switch hosts every player till lag stopped lag persisted every host migration games controls weird ui awful old ui better old combat better old hanglider better hell even old progression better like idea artifacts way wollay gone rubbish opinion artifacts imo provide sub stat boost also give one stat point player choose put large interesting skill tree allows players experiment different builds example play warrior could invest points would improve sustain tankiness invest points build would improve attack speed life steallife leech etc many things showcased wollays twitter website even make new game utterly disappointed new cube world firmly believe dont see proper fixes tweaks improvements game fall continue stay alpha cube worlds shadow also apologies poor writing skills firstly ignore reviews september reviews alpha version rather beta game changed much consider different game alphanow game much wanted like cannot recommend literally garbage progression system trash barely progress

didnt install mod needed make better recommend game search youtube mod removes region locking stuff get mod actually playable worth game good current state exploration rpg reward called exploring

bridging gap instead making legendary gear absolutely useless crossing little white line take one tier every area away home location get rid plus mechanic favor kneecapping players isnt way get explore remove necessity finding every single travel item every single region instruments instead finding wilderness take character town learn song region allows instrument used successfully reigns make different kinds big small avian lizard etc way region explored allows riding different kind pet one must explore finally able ride favorite one without riding travel interim claws take away infinite stamina instead make set found increase efficiency climbing old logarithmic curve alpha days call progression aka improve ui currently stuff goes offscreen theres absolutely explanation class abilities anywhere grouping items region small obvious crafting tedious takes far much beef relicsartifacts significantly give us option increase combat stats instead subclass swapping going free dont make us go town put option somewhere dont let packs enemies contain multiple tiers foe since power distant white greengreen blueetc stop letting epic chilifolk absolutely stomp new players trying fight onionlings bad design fun really flying friends free let us fast travel instead saves time saves frustration increases fun factor maybe make option social menu promote stop making warriors charge specials rogues get instant melee moves lanterns need massive brightness boost make fuelbased way getting caught night isnt tedious slog though pitch darkness enemies annihilate especially since one might access fast travel points near town newest regions full disclosure recommend game current state ive already refunded keeping eye updates longer see anything new comes draws moment cube world basically blank slate could could great rpgwhy refunding gamewell honest biggest reason punishes exploring new regions basically resetting character back zero making hard earned gear worthless groundwork leveling system matter character stuck level saying game bad time played quite lot fun encountered whats basically games version brotherhood steel scaled volcano raided castle snuck villages sewer system loaded zombies slimes sorts nasties realized game didnt really anything else offerso positive review im willing wait little longer wollay actually something mess game currently

good fun game fun game needs content truly immersive game play wouldnt recommend added still fun play friends fun game would nice levels maybe artifacts give skills class fun like good grind restarting often kinda fun little game gear based game loop put level continuation next loop takes time getting used fun none less fun overall rpg every new area like restarting game expect gear works surrounding areas fun sandbox game need content region lock need removed plus servers would awesome world events stuff fun start unfun continue invalidates progress region mechanic would good executed differently rather completely dropping ass try take new regions ok needs ton work done progression system isnt satisfying exploring pretty fun lacks meaningful depth time gear get region locked needs game really shine fun mods custom music easy put fun friends fun alone fun worlds explore new area challenge wish bit power progression zones overall feels fresh play new zonealso means dont need worry leveling friends much play different regions solo different one together great friends cant always online time fun adventure type game lots small lore good game play cool long day doesnt take

world favour make mod turns game alpha would international hero devs fix devs sell game someone else fix hero cape boat load doritos fix x game came like million years ago seems lost features reasons play exploring punishing progression limited region game close good game currently little replay value may find fun short hours however much see given procedural generation may find parts game would find interesting long time game feels empty theres nothing somehow less content beta worth game goodi feel like little bit rough patch right systems place show promise could see issues getting fixed simple patches road game fundamentally scrapped alpha beta shows repeat grind pointless seen rpg date region locking gear abysmal ruins feeling progression skill systems done away combat joke kind words game waiting years past promises ignored remove features enjoyedbuy game risk cant say worth anything current state game gone direction amazing alpha headed wollay remade game many times feedback anything years fucking around various game designsthe old cubeworld site stated amazing changes soon coming expanded upon get shell even alpha washurts give game negative reviewwould say im

times rngesus drops things need changing traveling still fun play imo havent even explored content yet game bad removed fun things alpha didnt really add anything value replace dev stops existing people dont like game probably wont updated game better ever would recommend game dead crab raveupon full release game quite changes people werent aware prior unreleased version game keeping mind time took released aside silence developer side things truly take theres uproar mind still think hate matter perspective true reflection game state personal experience game isnt true reflection negative reviews big majority negative reviews due region lock although understand also preference negative reviews critique religion locking start fresh every time enter new region unless items used neighboring zones one hrs beta majority betarelease beta skill tress learn different abilities give minor stats full released get every ability unlocked minus travelinginstruments region lock released stats equipment based mostly mission progressively level gets need situation difficulty complete region almost completion get crafting books craft items next region also buy store restart every zone nothing unless even transportation gear start doesnt take away game since quite easy regain everything sometimes even better old gear firmly believe changes come progression system would able keep glider spike shoes boats reign transportation since physical objects one would keep around possibility instruments dont agree much since think like learning different melodies different regions honestly makes sense dungeons fun specially friends different classes nice partying bosses thing would recommend checkpoints dungeons certain points given dungeons really big travel someone party dies also understand might never thing since exploited itd also big deal implemented properly water regions bit tedious deal since dont start boat swim island first island go always boat available water regions quite easy complete jungle zones somewhat hit miss since sometimes vegetation dense blocks paths also harder find objectives comparison zone bosses fun exception magesrangers since bit difficult types may experience group people including also think less besides region lockingskilltree game pretty much alpha many exciting things coming future every moment game memorable music scenery adventuring made game give sense blissful happiness glad game finally official released hope wollay pixxie continue share growth beautiful project rest us excited future cube world hope

mmorpg love muchextra infoits easier start friends funnier even game excellent region lock gear problem provides fun replayability tons fun far certainly difficult people make rewarding gameplay opinion within minutes new zone plenty gear means move around faster embarking next artifact haste nothing design disappoints see room improvement certainly worth game fire dont care took long time game release game masterpieceit cool watch devs come new stuff game kinda add back exp artifacts would make kinda balance dungeons really hard get artifacts sometimesplay game friends enjoy funny memes game fun enough mess around friends recommend buying full price youre going play solo maybe worth absolute maximum game fun first area clear everything essentially resets even movement items receive fun gameplay loop game fun first couple hours becomes repetitive little incentive explore clear first region outside different environments game fun right mentalityneeds tweaks mostly progression side game also needs roadmap expect kind updates promised recentlymultiplayer fun good internet needs better netcodei give game good still lacks areas still would mean cheap game get money worth game fun isnt used doesnt matter many people giving negative review isnt expected without judging game merits doesnt play want doesnt make objectively bad game progression pretty fun especially large group friends party areas great game fairly polished game runs smoothly multiplayer works well also everyone complaining spawning far friends talk flight master nearest town youll able teleport friends free explained fully patch notes earlier week looking forward content future game greatits diferent progression system works great endless style game rough state right little communication developer unlikely gonna hear anything backthere dedicated modders like nexus committed bringing back old removed features removed transition game alphaif youre still holding hope game please give

outweighs cons wollay listen feedback work wollay abandoned game f game fun game minecraft skyrim exploring come game trying make op build build ahouse game want explore friends game play game worth alpha promising fun stuff cannot said release game nothing like alpha dev seemingly gone hiding already game nothing like alpha wrong ways absolute scam dev took money ran like released alpha years ago game good invading people stream owning bad game pretty good get initial confusion difficulty keep mind game different alpha focus exploration less focus rpg elements due removal xp skill tree systems game pretty good far soon got legendary item started killing everything fast got pretty boring since need find strong enemy lure strong friendly allies got legendary mage staff way pretty boring recommend game soon get legendary weapon everything easy mode game really fun things gotta change dont mind region locked gear much taking away mobility switch region fun maybe make pets ridable without reins least dont walk switch region crafting books kind useless since much easier get eq means amount items required craft stuff way high gems diamonds etc way expansive worthwhile also think diamonds gold rare find would make crafting usable abilities need bit nerf trying survive fire mage ult rouges warriors idk jump hit lot times impossible since almost kill instantly even decently powerful eq artifacts meaningful ultimate goal game get many increasing small relevant stats unrewardinghopefully devs keep updating game make even fun despite toxicity game isnt good alpha much better version apparently level finding sort artifact completely stupid alpha could kill monsters get experience fun go fetch quest level dissapointing game fun take long time find artifacts game isnt really great modding helps experience unless friends would go elsewhere pray updates lads game lost soul progress non existent everything good alpha stripped beta hope game get fixed game really lacks sense progression make progress start feeling powerful first region go next region basically quest region get items game great wollay decided change game works completely ruined dissapointment immeasurable gaming experience ruined lol suck game better alpha game completely changed weak shallow experience devoid made love first place alpha feels like game whatever sad see happen one anticipated games ever please listen fans make better decisions game fun first ten hours fell late game progression form weak buffs movements stats diminishing returns still solid game needs content game good creator ran money new region wonder knows itll disappear game good initial release years ago wollay dipped released steam dipped see years epic store game great alphathese changes terrible ill change review fix progression system game much better early versions rework game thought dead updates years game suddenly pops back instead refined game big release six years completely different game thats incredibly shallow removed best selling point content apparently left years ago couldnt handle pressure sure shit happens gotta take mental health consideration sucks backers hey game cool conceptit stayed dead gettingmuch deserved criticism disappeared form social contact like first time instead communicating anything people certainly targeted wollay reviews thats nono genuine criticism since fantastic concept early game alpha current features refined itd easy enjoyable timesink deserve personal criticism simply due lack professionalism shows straight hiding everything instead dealing unreal straight release cash grab afk initially going keep opinion let game develop wollay truthfully gone back old habbits doesnt deserve anybodies money plenty better games similar vein worth time days much deserving developers dont support guy game went awesome alpha future awesome game devs personal project okregion locking makes exploration funskills longer existcrafting nearly nonexistant due limited resources generated dropped well high cost per weapongame drops higher level areas cant kill lowest level spawns tutorial anythingalpha worth wouldnt recommend one game probably never updated much hope played two hours youll never see money developer ran game wouldve good developer stayed worked refunding gameplay good challenging hopefully content continuously introduced time nonpaid dlc removal statleveling system kills ability progress well region locked glider boat etc infinite night also large concern havent found way make torch sort want spend coins town time gameplay really fun release isnt looking like hr game like people wanted price point think worth itim artifacts completed regions still ton left dogame getting daily updates leading release im hopeful continue see added fixedthe expectations game high feedback mixed believe people fun playing game get moneys worthpeople seem want gameplay sucks major disappointment cant recommend current state hopefully wollay updates thats unlikely games lack luster point id glad try actually full game geez start loved alpha waiting years update huge mess would like say please fix game like alphaspent hours grinding beta trying get two star items could progress got two three star items classes lured mobs guarding vendor gnome npss could kill vendor offers three star gear could buy gold got grinding one two star enemies basically cheating hours gameplay get better items became easy mode farm three eventually five star enemies boring combat happened old duck roll jump thump drink potion combat alpha cant beat five star dungeons yet got area complete pretty much done bother grinding next area essentially cookie cutter mess repeat thing original alpha wasnt deep progression felt fun got powerful enough take world hey play new class got tons red item artifacts also land looked really good everywhere looks generic polish alpha please rerelease steam new players also play get quests gear collect special items kill bosses get artifactsthen like rpg go new area get new gear sounds like standard rpg fare maybe would nice keep movement options thats balance issue enough dislike game get grindy fun give second try ive really enjoying mage give time get therethere major differences alpha build theres need jump final conclusions right away give time try see like changes made enjoying slight worries believe wollay make game truly envisions give us leveling system please itll make game actually decent way gets super old super early go back alpha dont buy editdont buy still supportnews devs look guides theres mod fixes problems beta version alpha didnt wollay pixie might want consider outside help would make neutral review community dont think devs deserve support aka paid product actually give support news change community would agree needs changed back originally go download alpha version game free online game much better experience go get crack alpha much better trainwreck go play project hedra instead cube world alpha feeling dev cares opinion responsive god awful recommend c god really wish could recommend game state cant let state one early alpha players game much changed hoping praying wollay would deliver something incredible life times heard cubeworld released steam less lot us freaked finally could go back playing cubeworld better cubeworld got feels like shell shell used basics unnecessary additions slapped called day cannot recommend game current state region locking dumb equipment locking dumb new skill system worse active skills passive class skill skills effected ability explore fact generating world around us like climbing swimming hang gliding sailing even boats hang gliders region locked making collecting anything seem pointless cant even call rpg theres levelling skill points reason help anyone except equipment works one area buy game full price wait gets better god damn dev released game got moneys disappeared like years ago dont put hopes bottomless pit game gonna short sweet review yes lot things could improved game lot hope course perfect pretty fun game regardless havent played friends quite yet id imagine compared singleplayer playing friends makes experience better know everyones complaining region locking lack exp far dont mind theres much content individual area think region locking may actually make game enjoyable know im minority really like time start new areas questing line start beginning know compared rpgs little odd think creative way allow hours fun rather reaching endgame quickly defeating everything matter seconds much hope future game think wollay able make cube world something great good game bad devplease keep updating know wont remove region locking make artifacts give actual buffsallow steam workshop mods people dont rely moddersmake game cheaper u keeping samei loved game first day nothing wrong itbut got point move regions didnt want since went mage already op didnt enjoy classes never touched good game fun challenging issues gear working outside region madelooted fun coop experience good game friends spent hours friend hoping content comeworks device without problems good game like drama around region locked stuff makes laughholds found memories good enough expected lot six years wasnt big fan game enjoyed watching people play back day time forgot really big part playing almost completely new start exploring different creatures region like bunnies getting beat death later pretty fancy regions unique items help unlock dungeons discover treasures special places pretty cool also quests get talking strangers randomly discovering quests location exploring worldon hand tedious rules like resetting inventory cross border get another region forcing search basic important items boat glider real way progress region whats far quests actually either kill boss save person monsters resists waves arena dont gain level killing mobs completing missions level collecting artifacts missions twice even three progress wasnt saved reason got lot gold almost value completed least one region wont worry gain pay unless spend traveling ocean incredibly empty look see sand seaweed night incredibly dark barely even see whats front always pay gold coins make daytime blind feel night resume game bad repetitive empty get tiring im playing friend recommend decided buy anyway know playing friends always makes things better cant imagine playing alone would play maximum around hours still regions play missions finish dont expect play good first impressions however would suggest removeoverhaul region locking systems people want feel like theyre consistently progressing adventuring feel like theyre punished bring back skill trees lessen confusion people experience helping sense progression also adding growth make pets useful less allow people gain killing normal creatures happen utilisation mentioned skill tree additionthat said game great potential look forward seeing fixes made make enjoyable used good foundation unbelievably different terms scope charm beta wollay locked echo chamber created something one wanted good game fun play bad sucks good game mmo action rpg clone apparently want like crisp minimalistic art style although splashes colour might hurtthat end game obviously design decision exploreconquer every zone want hop leave anytimeyou want play friends go new zone start power level instead one low level guy feeling useless got drive kid soccer training split buddies continue zone pick exactly left good game nice good game worth wait good game lot potential theres still hope teased features make back game current state game really goodwhy couldntcant hire additional staff assist game beyond like nobody given money good game hard first discover core game play loop progression accelerated much fun friends varied party skill sets styles classes much hardereasier play solo everything viable balanced multiplayer party good game needs experience back remove region locked gear im fun game good game wish wasnt dropped good game thumbs feel accomplished play really put time get anywhere good lordfrankly hate mmoification thats hot trend late like certain games added crap wasnt needed im intruiged game takes mmo tropes baked genre minimalizes im keen endless treadmill

bonuses yeah start new province go back old one slap old kit roflstomp stuff wantfrankly like means new province fresh new adventure need use cunning guile avoid getting crushed means new province accessible buddy started playing hours game may agree perhaps rush everincreasing numbers doubtless thousands games cater urge wish happiness playing one closer like worth asking price friends play good hopefully get better time goes good openended exploration rpg interesting system progression thats fun grind traverse good far already want reset gear since found legendary sword im overpowered dtrying finish everything first area move next one reset gear challenge cool first stage almost gear would great gear progression system instead legendary random drop instantly overpowers playerso spent time playing game say game pretty cool region lock actually great thing mountgliderboat allows partially skip new location without proper exploration something dealt region lock helped resolve issue another thing even would keep gear new location harder keep interest challenging would shit new zone precious shiny gear whats pointalso region lock resolves endless leveling issue ie would like game definitely requires another perspective different expect regular rpg need rush game explore slowly good without mods great mods little slow early got hooked hours first days id keep playing feel like ive seen everything game offer see problem removal xp levelling regionlocked combatspecial items however regionlocked mobility items serve purpose getting riding speed increased hours artifact hunting think id like able ride pet upon entering new region without find item levels currently nothing indicator artifacts foundb artifacts give small increases mobility stats permanent progression

wollay could least warn us whats scraped whats still works one want giant ass citieswhy bush break drop star item lolanyways havent listed everything new game much game im yet experience everything excited keep playing even planning making youtube series game dont care im one others sad games state ill still enjoy thats main goalalso wasnt planning allowing comments fkc want expand ideas game comment away want hate wollay dont bother wasting time ill ignore one favourite things coming things games even never get addededit sadly creator game couldnt handle feedback community disappeared face earth im going consider game dead reccomend game either gets worked b major issues game fixed abandon something worked years life run away little hate kinda makes weak need learn take feedback honestly sending suggestions feedback ignoring hate blast alpha good bit fun version multiplayer isnt buggy graphics pleasing eye gameplay mechanics fun however enter new zone like starting game againdue random nature drops get either grind hours make zero progress kill one enemy get four five star weapon trivializing content zoneit generally fun enemies mages greatly tuned cant really recommend game would love love early game doesnt feel good every hours youre thrust back given option similar progression system alpha six years ago would happily flip review would love explore biomes alas dont ten hours grind every zone look steam library today looking revisit old games quickly stumbled upon game againthis game example happens quality assurance kind game developer access large community players already payed play alpha version dying play working years utilized player base already wouldve built game community side would undoubtedly made better product refinement expansion alpha got years ago went viral imagine playing demo first hours new rpg youre looking forward developers go completely dark develop game least hope developing still get drip fed information maybe screenshot every months suddenly stripped experience points equipment find gets taken away whenever leave area thats developer treated fans get hands alpha build somehow good luck great time group friends despite lacking features please support game unless miracle developer gets head ass heavy reworks game buy lot fun playing game like others find regions annoying artifacts useless would really like see better progression system similar alpha high hopes bought refunded fast feels like worse realesed steam would recommend hopes high steam release months devs gone like years ago still much potential dont care improveupdate whats point modding community hope game actually enjoyable hadnt chance play alpha minireview serves comparison versions hopefully better objectiveonce get grip play game properly charged attacks skill usage haste class abilities enjoy lot thanks huge factor immersion exploration thus quite addictive wander around look counter however agree less reviewers much potential lot things need fixedimproved im looking forward future updatesdont let negative especially toxic reception fool game nonetheless good technically gameplaywise hard pass youre completionist wants nothing search every nook cranny every single zone guess itd fun enough youre press every button find key goodif youre expecting rpg ability explore pace absolutely youre lot potential good game needs longevity overall progression zones becomes bit staleadd overall progression add unique biomes take inspiration terraria aspect large dungeons big raid bosses nottldr base gameplay good needs give players reason explore environments explore good ideas poorly executed massive potential improved gotta thumbs practically none features shown since alpha including faction quests new quest types grand cities improved ai new classes even stripped back features ui elements skills parties addition widely criticised region lock system gear including mounts become useless next regioncouldnt recommend current price feels bare bones alpha promise needs improvement right understand developer going doesnt work well hope project continues much potential executed poorly isnt fair consumers try deal developer prone disappearing would recommend purchasing game current state game update since release dev really put unpolished game capacity completely ignore players bought first timers old vets better time never decided disliked game quickly spawn context clue anything usually fine reason game wrong almost like little even minimalist learning use crafting menu quickly came realize cant see half displayed information due appearing screen allowing move inventory crafting menus returning money back asap ever played game really loved looked played video actually played experience intrusive felt pity game way feel cube world really wanted like progression feels restrictive hope developers make game little user friendly time heck let gear transfer biomes feels bad lot fun friends gives zelda vibes game throwback childhood rpgs lot fun played alpha game ecstatic heard officially coming excited see wollay updated new features got completely different game vaguely resembled previous build understand going alpha betarelease version bound many potentially drastic changes current build game lacks lot made default version cube world fun exploration steadyconsistent progression felt great finally able raid first dungeon tame first pet buy boathang gliderwhatever else beta fun explore unknown areas map blocked blue squares explored find monsters way strong run life current build progression stops finish zone decide want grind gear wear areas wander hope best keep exploring repeatable events area dont want lose ability ride pets glide air deal abysmal swim speeds dont want lose super cool gear found took step equipments comfort zonealso gear cant equip viable zones takes seconds equip set adds tedium exploration things build right though like classes flavor make unique mages levitate especially fun mess lot easier get feel instant progress gear system however still limited previously stated grievances tell lot thought put build ton new interesting events take place zone creatures beat flavor enemies factions cults sort stuff like simplistic combat alpha current system still feels bit nice change around inputs bit fat finger use item button much sit combat start

way reminds monster hunter armor weapons define personal stats action like walking around enjoy landscape things agree like finding boat every time go new region game week hope see improvements coming near future hello probably wont formal review would like give going give shot explaining want get cube worldwe start saying big fan alpha version locked away yearswith said fully capable putting behind order give game fair chance enjoymenthowever synopsis would alpha version cube world close masterpiece terms game design needed love attention regards adding content existing structure although would still happy cube world alpha simply reintroduced steam instead total rework game nowthis version cube world turned classic grindlootexplore game purely exploration grind even fails reward players exploring actual progression mechanics cube world labeled rpg misleading actual gameplay experiencewith mind partial fan exploration grinding games mans sky provided okay experience yearly updates followed release game nms could level gear obtain better ways things much like leveling rpg despite goal upgrades purely means getting upgrades quicker peakin current version cube world work way zero hero hours depending class seeing classes imbalanced however peak gear enter next region next nothing square one leads grind gear essentially lost previous region get level sense real progression always hitting gear cap course get gear called gear stays regions directly around region found gear although isnt progression isnt going anything get region little quicker said getting regions unrewarding get artifacts give bonus swimming light radius etc nothing actual value softhard cap reduces scaling even morecurrently also huge variety quests game well wouldnt huge problem werent case mini encounters entire content game nowits safe say version cube world lifespan many hours gameplay enjoy would put hours generouswith mind lets talk alpha version cube world available download purchase anymore legal practicesin alpha version cube world world explore character build gear gloryto start alpha leveling came getting experience points pet upon killing enemies stronger enemy experience would get taking also incentivised combat actually fighting enemies leveled gain power increase buffed base stats little allowed wear higher tiered gear locked away power level gear locked behind power levels allowed steady ramp progression almost never ended gear could find scaled permanently level allowing infinite progression chose play long one character becoming stronger level world leveled would see enemies locations get even stronger explored said enemy scaling also infinite engaging always fun play againston top leveling skill tree expanded upon gave skill points use combat non combat skills allowed people played class able specialize unique experiencethere much said missing current version alpha perhaps add onto review ever decide develop proper list things werecould beenwith said current version cube world well deserved still semiplayable dedicated fan pure exploration rpg games didnt know alpha existedalthough generally lost faith developers game perhaps one day right thing deliver us cube world loved heres recommendation help fight haters cube world different bad still quite like different like grown something hey wolly hope updates class skills skills dynamic game skills alpha actually cool maybe get another idea waited years hope thats im patiently waiting uptadesbest luck love wolly hey guysfirst never played alpha played via steam familiy sharingi must say game really awesomei like grafiphics style adventure like feelingbut actually found glich exploit wanted point outwhen dual wielding upgrade first weapon onceafter try taking

working gamethere cause lot critics cube world launched even game atm good game hey years silent actually get play cube world ill honest enjoyed iteven though recommended cube world im saying game didnt flaw big one well let go good thing found first environment great everything look lively colorful making exploring alone fun enjoyable game greatly present exploring explore stronger become doesnt mean would become overpower explore zone adaptive game become cant use gear another zone including plus gear course need explore want get stronger allow explore even terrain artifact interesting actually level need explore gathering much information possible locate artifact artifact concept act like treasure hunt rather progressionnow done pros flaws game unbalance start game die lot monster actually one shot get close fighting range enemy first feel like hell especially mages move strong hell challenge strong enemy first stand chance get rarer gear get much powerful go even unbalance skills actually hella broken example ranger scout subclass ultimate quicksands strong move slow enemy let take damage hilariously low cooldown seconds cooldown actually start activate ability disappear actually beat level melee boss starter gear abusing skill cheating game lacking motivation get stronger gear become powerful zone change area gear immediately become useless weaker level gear zone seeing people get discourage exploring play area theyre bored stop playing artifact even fun find still doesnt enough impact make people think exploring important biggest flaws game repetitive difference repetitive replayable cube world lean repetitive rather replayable time explore different area different experience make gear fight something get better gear get best gear beat dungeons quest area get information artifact change area everytime yes something different time main thing always samelooking review may think game isnt fun need try game may miss progression motivation game enjoyable everything pros blend together perfectly little love care game clearly masterpiece hey maybe another man sky fiasco know conclusion game may best cannot find experience like anymore may enjoy doesnt stop game fun encourage everyone pick game try enjoy great well leave review hey pretty good still pretty good heyremove region lock add levelsskill tree much better start ofim fun tho hi guys another review hereoverall like many gameplay features dont get wrong combat kind fun exploring fun crafting basic might funwhat complete kicks game progression system soon leave current area county gear besides gear gets useless matter epic supergear ago looted boss received quest crafted absurd price gets rolled starting gear statsso really tried like game current state fun overall collecting hours shrooms buy gem rare gem per shroom craft rare item needs four gems get quest outside current area unable use progression system name states lock regionlock system splits cubeworld less x x amount countries small grinding games look hi two centsi played alpha back day periodically since games harness infinite resources progression grab attention enjoy spending hours repeating actions processes game enjoyed alpha betathis game brutal unfriendly new players watched someone youtube play first time game made sense lucky prior experience makes first hours bearable tend get angry capacity likely hate game confusion powerlessness youll start gets better could defeat regions weakest boss fourth hour point feeling genuine excitement exploring world hour six amassed entire inventory gold purple armor highest tiers failing defeat last boss feeling weak decided would travel new region armor weapons except amulet became worthless despite popular experience still fun virtually restarting agree wollay game best exploration focus currently artifacts ruins provide player combat advantage love searching goal conquer regions become strongest ever also read essay type negative reviews fail explain items properly items pieces gear work one region hard find grind bosses first region one village found even sold two items fun idea quest legendary gold item toooverall recommend game seriously read comments style cube world niche requires bit patience choose another game respectable developer twenty dollars kill enjoy spending long hours exploring may worth money hi normally write game reviews reason hate popular actual fair comparison current version alpha seriously guys loving hate game seem remember alpha seriously ridiculous toxic screaming fair criticismsskill treethe skill tree seems top complaint game alpha unlocked basic features using boat riding pet grinding hours upon hours gain levels repetitive killing lower levels mobs wollay took right turn transformed small simple quests much faster fun yes region locked great forces travel around since gold transfers regions simply find flight master teleport near quests unlock boats animal riding handglides etc opinion region locking could better weapons armor locked different biomes rather borders lands still right change skill treeswalkinganother complaint got better alpha walking game know reviewers fell well cannot remember pain staking time would take player go one region next especially lower level riding boat handglide wanting excuse hate game guaranteed much much less walking gameother quickiesthe region locking also makes much fun play friends find high level gear weapons satisfying go back highlevel mobs go town pets much fun find switch feelthere defiantly faults overshadowed great improvements gameconclusionpeople need break mob mentality think alpha game compare fairly yes wollay bad communicating remember working game probably time wife job dream game thinking working game together creating new races mechanics makes happy brings best game want game made corporation go ahead find hereps perfect game mind greatly disappointed go ahead make im sure could better free time im sure medical emergency break fans totally understanding lack communication like community high expectations lead long fallsits bad feels better alpha build thought would become laying around sure buy funyou want creative open world roleplaying game play otherswait hytale play wow dunno probably games minecraft highkey ever good mods hip squarethere charming visuals chill music pets collect dungeons conquer various quests long awaited fans update promised cube world great quest system selection character play styles new worlds overall polished game deliverin many ways version improved initial launch added music quests fast traveling viable way craft armor weapons effective money system buy items beautiful new landscapes well special items earn loot definite things hold game back however include character customizationprogression lack information worlds poor lore ill talk region locked items players obtain weapons gear good power single area unless items bad seems first strange feel powerful one area helpless next encourages keep hunting weapons gear well explore beautiful scenery time playing game trying find gear random enemies disappointed get items cannot use classes random drops favor give class quests however almost always got useful item money obtained said quests buy gear villages even buy materials gnomes complete quests let craft gear cube world robust way players play around region locked gear real problem however region locked transportation items want sail glide ride around area already partially explored said area counter productive exploration character progression fun general would like see items move purchased shop permanent inventories future updatethe region locked transportation also negative character progression riding one noticeable stats level game even something players time update expand skill trees instead gave players skills right gate figure use still class specialization though provides play variety arguably good combat level feels underwhelming previous mentioned region locked exploring items minor miscellaneous skills minor complaint update promised new character races addition original play none also game would benefit vanity slot keep cool looking gear whole timefor issues information tutorial new players get feel controls fact night really fun always stay inn till dawn really need night game stands make layers go back town game would also benefit region completion percentage well way reliably missing areas marked level need beat dungeons dungeons mostly underground making hard spot map right npcs randomly tell cool stuff would like see dedicated information dealer sell information probably higher price high tier informationand finally world lore boring feel like fits world lore pedestals sometimes mark important areas map enough sadly lore collection stories world factionsraces collect read journal enjoy whenever mark progression probably ball mark unfortunately game right arguably still beta version creator hinted future updates possibly basehouse buildingso sum everything game fun little hollow roadblocks player exploration new players want outside guide tips fixes mentioned presented easy hoes madunpopular gaming opinion game pretty cool hoes mad homeboy dipped want recommend cant honest review game lacking different ways lack leveling system hard handle gear region locked kinda sucks gear could transfered upgraded like boss system regions conquered become merged location played alpha beta steam release game still incredible truly recommend comparing alpha isnt fair game honestly enjoyed beginning game could use like little bit progression changes update something hopefully love game honestly bought rated positively many great hours playing alfa back daythe game still playble like times less playble honestly dont see game receiving much hate played little bit back alpha always enjoyed game feel bit different like direction hes taking still isnt much tutorial guide play thoughmy biggest peeves game multiplayer doesnt well unless parties great internet finicky region region lose progress youve made essentially okay dont mind restarting looking new weapons everywhere pve essentially grinding feels way hard bit lacking skill possible outskill mobs extremely hard especially multiplayer theres even tiny bit latency honestly dont understand huge amount hate people giving current state game personally dont find bad yes region locking little annoying much makes want unleash rage suns couple things could change would definitely help game gliders boats reigns perm items least way make perm wouldnt something make perm immediately something make perm work ex acquire certain item craft complete x amount regions like boat could region glider reigns something like another thing could gear switching regions gear could go stars rank something instead becoming super weak starter items chooses random rank purple artifacts also need something give passive barely noticable buffs maybe artifacts gives damage buff somethingthose ideas something friend thought personally like idea think could work well another thing people said alpha way better current version every way dont think loved alpha bit current state game gives dungeons lot better alpha fun little bit something would play hours like people think game fine could use couple changes think people need calm stop raging like family got destroyed honestly really enjoy hard learn first lot tutorials youtube watching tutorials game able learn pretty quick address big part leveling yeah might like normal rpg xp instead level artifacts still fun play dont need xp make rpg fun yes might make rpg games cube world still fun xp also region locked gear say hard find gear dont need gear start new zone like starting adventure fun starting also version coop much easier able play friends yet seems fun ok back gear clearing regions able get nice gear probably get blue weapon second third zone lot pieces armor set zones normally get atleast green rating armor fun play changed lot still fun honestly blast first couple hours playing game playing false assumption game still beta point game huge balancing problems punishes trying explore things youre done first region really stupid region lock system point game worth would pay game really fun game complete first region fun stops might well make new character honestly better trying go region lock system even region lock system removed might get another hours honestly game doesnt much many obvious features already game even present alphaso unless game receives huge updates fixes gameplay either wait go sale really good price dont bother modders might able save game fixing problems adding features eventually thatll take honestly super excited games release last year sitting library uninstalled tried long convince game good honestly better people make still worth euros dollars honestly cube world really fun game artifacts pain acquire arent really worth find good gear makes region youre breeze would recommend even setback whole region locking thing going game gets way better whole group people new regions feel less tedious honestly recommend pirate alpha version game includes playtime replay ability far fun shit removed full release stop supporting woolay updated game settle bare minimum yes know hours low invalidate point warning alt hours decide want refund honestly dont know im fun constant exploration trying die everything funny way enjoy casual gaming man running around without single care thats friends even better actual story takes time understand world large need find clues shit convoluted fun ps tutorial fun figuering everything lmao honestly like version honestly im writing review finish game awards honesty game isnt bad youll get good hours gameplay starts get little repetitive happens get friends help keep interesting dunno know might update later real thoughts game one day honestly im pretty disappointed enjoy alpha lot moreits worth money opinion honestly kills give game negative review waited long let start saying game really like alpha remember back day waiting got home play could run around fly explore amazing game today bought game opened wasnt anything like remembered game feels really hollow magic gone honestly one disappointing games region locking second worst addition game right removal talent trees alpha fun although lacked story end goal fact id say large portion fun running around aimlessly addition quests feels like way try say added something game really limit honestly really love game polish put im happy see releasedhowever game total downgrade promised initially im severely disappointed see happenthe multiplayer feature something say absolute improvement leastthere major improvements could make game better lessen region locking make tools like boat permanent theres sense actual progression everything reset noticeably smaller regions steam achievements badges improve level scaling im getting jumped enemies trying mana tree quest add beastiary quest log understanding enemy improve qol knowing youre going vital cosmetics characters building oceans need drastic improvement theres water mobs seem spawn land often underwater give tailor carpenter npcs actual use otherwise theyre show listen reviews readd skills xp lot combat borderline boring moves especially berserker warrior sit hold button enemies due rage healing damage takethe weapon modification game really good id love see similar level voxel editing things furniture clothing maybe steam workshop supportas game stands okay good could wish launched early access least know isnt final releaseif game would transparent development last years feel community feedback would made game far better upon release honestly game good old cube world people years ago salty little things play fun honestly cant reccomend game current state exp system skill trees removed way level go artifact hunting nothing stats artifacts merely increase speeds climbingswimmingmounted speed even range lantern lights monsters rarity like equipment however long dont equipment youll able kill white named mobs even time possibly needing heal afterwards dont gear forget trying go anything doesnt white names youll get decimated region locked equipment kills exploration may want whereas alpha would mostly exploring going rather linear path new system makes unless bother going clearing entire zone going process getting item drops items quit current zone probably bluepurple even orange gear morph trash gray equipment effectively resetting back boats gliders also afflicted system gear way keep gear outside original area skills basically overwatchlike got two class specific skills ult depending class spec recommend cube world ive lot fun time alpha beta maybe fixed ill recommend stands youd better playing trove even wynncraft server minecraft better alternatives imo honestly enjoyed game lot dont mind start scratch every ive farming gear dont worry weapons thats armor farm maybe get lucky later items anyone doesnt know use region sure many people hating definitely great game opinion honestly like new system regionlocking agree peoples criticisms however current problems like fixed doubt game fun long progression made rewarding possible feeling well experience weve waited cube world honestly really wanted like game purchased alpha build back excited see wollay releasing game steam started playing realized lot things experience changed im going list basically different game trivial mechanics kept first really liked new cube world like need talk npcs find things also like new uii several problems game however dislike abilities unlocked start ability tree new gearbased progression doesnt bother would like traditional leveling back support ability tree nothing else ability tree alpha made need think skills would need put points whatnot besides problems also lot fun regardless decided travel next biome however hugely disappointed gear region locked stopped playing felt like beaten game already sense didnt want beat overall first biome experience really good wish maybe instead needing start next biome experience spread would like experience progression whole map one biome makes sense dont mind find items long dont need find many times honestly would recommend cube world current state might fun maybe hour friend lacking content quickly put end fun game creates illusion giant map explore different biomes reality spend time one single region due region locks travel another biomeregion pretty much items acquired previous region useless completed one region youre gonna lose items move new region might aswell create new character try new class instead personal opinion region locking needs removed content weaponequipment tiers exploration dont spend running around empty fields nothing enemies occasional group npcs quest sadly one games really hyped years ago really really want like impossible current state honestly ima remain optimistic believe game could get better lack skill tree regionlocked gear kinda annoying doesnt feel rewarding used run problems inventory screens clipping side monitor example checking one shops couldnt see much items cost prices border screen even tried changing resolution see help sadly didnt another problem prevalent blue fog im sure reason whenever die try go different area fog doesnt want dissipate tried changing render distance didnt help end day cant really much hope review help dev players dont recommend getting game suggest wait updates want buy dont let review stop good game state honestly would recommend game without second thought wasnt bugged like right today main core mechanic game artifacts bugged work properly effect half registered making whole thing pointless devs completely disappeared right release leaving us defective productwhile many people complaint game different expected reaction wich disagree real issue behavior devs actually change review positive one soon bugfix confirmed ever happens honestly even little bit worthy news since game released would probably lean towards recommending seems like abandoned honestly one best games ever played gutted wollay lord saviour disappeared wait definitely worth masterpiece childhood come back bigger better colours couldnt recommend game solo relaxing experience fun bash friends voxel graphics make beautiful canvas adventure wish new dynamic music transports cube world loved game since alpha still love nowthank shaping childhood wollay youre legend honestly pls make like alpha honestly game feels like late stage concept build game much potential isnt lot regards sadly cant recommend honestly let long game development dosnt represent pacing game isnt good overall game feels empty really wanted enjoy game understand dev personal issues deal still im surprised turned wanna love game hope updates make love honestly obviously alpha version anymore completely different game bad hell im lot fun playing understandable fans alpha mad didnt get game expected yes still doesnt make game badi recommend game bc im fun playing fun grind gear fun explore huge world fun play friends honestly isnt hoped much changed promised alpha much potential hundreds hours fun alpha long years regret say im disappointed feel like takes forever get anywhere especially early game monsters high level starting almost die single guy fact cant take equipment new regions weaker destroys whole aspect rpg get ridiculously strong crush everything feels like progression weapon customization still sick feature also see cant select different worlds like used finding special items creatures take literally forever seen positive negative rare therefore fun find since cant take new regions feels weak destroys whole enjoyment progression excitement back day alpha cannot unfortunately recommend game anymore honestlyits like forgot make game fungot got hype years ago waste money hoping pull nms hopes arent high steam release terrible region locked progression class design removal levelingtalent trees weapon customization crafting redundant buy current state refunded mine horrible concept exploration game horrible rework game functioned back open alpha lose practically progress punished exploring additionally nothing left region forced practically throw away progress made equipment doesnt carry regions reduces stats pretty much want sail across sea bad need go find boat region located somewhere middle lake mainland somewhere game also imbalanced open alpha almost time prepare dodges pretty much go cycle dodgeattackdodge monster dies every character built like glass cannon fast way get around even altars scattered around easy miss never directly near dungeons places likely die always near towns meaning cant warp back town identify pieces leftovers got like unidentified armours weapons mmo style game bring next glaring issue game get piece equipment one people party playing solo exact class effectively money spent money find useless better finding flat good equipment relying finding good equipment identifying leftovers around map find various resource deposits like ore wood silk give resources type however classes need types resources meaning lot gets sold given friends useless useful effectively wasted finally decided move next region really hoping game would releasing steam years opened alpha somehow years dev time teasing features devs blog posts twitter pretty much place game currently leaving watered version tons contradictory design flawsits openworld rpg punishes exploringtldr stay away decided remove counter intuitive systems make game full pointless busywork combats fun enough go play trove instead youd get trove day would week hot garbage compared alpha already disappeared glad got free since

skill trees coming soon building aspect coming soon infinite leveling coming soon fast forward today theres progression get gear lose talent trees levels building held hope checked subreddit years wish walley would never finished game least could think good game could released miss dream cubeworld played tons hours alpha even years last update tried new version honestly say whatda fuck release steam feels like getting fist crush face everything changed worst side wish get alphaversion back could play funny interesting cool cube world waited fucking yearsand dont care people saybut pls bring back exp leveling system absolutely adored alpha cube world sad development stopped years ago reason liked alpha rpg system could explore rewarded exploring exotic pets strange bosses new gear becoming stronger found game spent hours first tbhhowever cannot recommend game restrictive overbearing parent whatever want one region things turn least bad region size hold skyrim sometimes hours spent one region get another region get pet wanted wanted explore regions ended running happy weak butt back original region gear made impotent outside got nice star sword well grey weak sharp pool noodle leave original regionit weird obtuse system developer would kept building alpha game would mixed reviews today positive believe developer free whatever wants arent owed better alpha cube world im asking one whatever wants however make product sell keep audience mindi almost guarantee large portion didnt recommend game loved cube world alpha going silent years plopping game feet running fear criticism unfortunate agree people act entitled agree people take comments far invalidate criticism merits absolutely love game every single way except one small thing within last year development developer overhauled way progress game currently stands becomes significantly boring complete first couple biomesregions probably max unless dev changes improves get max gameplay depending playing friends becomes boring repetitive want die yet despite every detail game love would still say game amazing buy absolutely love game alpha really enjoyed way game turned beta new quest system great absolutely love way implemented gamea lot people seem complain new region locking honestly dont think bad everybody makes fact really liked keeps gameplay goining encourages player get appropriate gear artifacts previousy leveled stayed overpowerd rest game still enjoy game discover new thingsthis way creates new challenges time enter new regionthis game gorgeous pixely graphics lovely sounds music feature love probably newly added quests taming systemi think game amazing everyone loves good adventure game absolutely loved cube world alpha spend countless hours playing even though never received updates held hope two full years wollay would come back four years later heard game coming actually genuinely hyped im distraught learn unfathomable reason removed good parts game wish hed revert start wholeheartedly dissapointed absolutely loved game back day done removing mmorpg part game vital made game fun something simple leveling region locking gear start different region im utmost happy game came disappointed way seems game pushed back features rather pushed forward hope future updates may fix anyway thank coming back please bring back game loved actually dont know think gamesometimes amusing also times feels empty running simulatorshould fun lot friends though actually lot fun playing game progression pretty smooth first region minor jumps difficulty region locking system isnt even harmful progression farming enough get items take next region however reward beating dungeon needs much greater currently right beating entire dungeon likely require game days farming yellow gear crafting buff potions gives artifacts increase stats like climbingswimming speed small amount fix would either make artifacts increase stats actually matter like healthattackdefense dungeon boss always drop item class use editoriginally posted review went new region still thought would easy progress get back however spending time region realized broken unfun progression really quest ride pet cant use glider keep mobility starting every region go process getting one shot every enemy exists besides select objectively boringyou cant even use coins got previous region speed progression good items locked behind quest cant dont good items essentially feels like progress spend hours previous region doesnt exist better starting new character region least experience different class admire coming back finish appreciate struggles gone bring game lifebut game ultimately combat combat isnt fun game exploration map already unlocked already know biomes expect across horizon game feels like community left development long unable point design ideas arent fun ultimately improve game meaningful waywhich basically happened hereit made passion lovebut sadly doesnt mean good agree game bit lacking contentwise hoping comeback similar certain game space explorationfor moment quite enjoy gamefarming tedious biomes tend know progress quickly blast gamethis game ways challenging pick fights plan travels choose youll go guess youll get efficiency exploration keyscuriosity driving try get many artifacts possible wonder cap exists end game bonuses able cross biome speed sound able light half world lanternthere one way find outthe adventure beginning agree lot criticism surrounding game losing key items like boat glider seems counter productive however game still fun explore plus items system great way continue adventure without completely restarting forcing vary build say low amount info things like relics work slightly annoying though fan new changes unlike get group friends fun youve long time fan replayibility live version loved alpha got high levels thing left game explore procedurally generated world fear enemies alpha outscaled enemies game ended lonely god endless world contrast live version forced play biome intelligently try max gear fight artifacts im hours yet explore ice lava biomes yet though look forward generally think praise alpha game totally misplaced tell even alpha version leveling tweaked scaling game always bound put ceiling difficulty enemies said endgame always bound unfun replayability always important factor game built around procedural generation things id like hope variety added game expand upon already high replayability believe design philosophy think could made better variety distinct dungeons variety types rooms found current dungeons classes class specializations would also nice addition fanboy game waited years game thing say alpha betterand thats sad like hey switched area forest forest start gear completely useless every single time switch area could lived would boat glider every piece gear also bugs alpha like hp bars arent syncing oni like idea game acutall state say dont buy actually someone tried play begins like first base menu go start game create character pop world goodbeside idea control thing youre lucky enough like youll spawn huge tree something character creation could go wrong due lightthen may wander around like hour finding something thats utterly useless continue buy better sword bow smth youll get oneshoted bumblebees ogres dwarf hunters bugs list goes onthen make quests new first time okay sounds fun enough really first time since repetitivetalk repetitive personally got bored one biome game really seem suggest explore well since gear reset area point quests one area theres way beside bad yet exquisite equipmentmy final thoughts hoped would good moment enjoyable thrilled really game doesnt feel rewarding although hope much get updated become better many ways also one alpha players back day big proponent new changes system many arbitrary features xp talents gear became arbitrary time went playing many regions new system feels like replayability higher im saying isnt room improvement foundation place update gives wollay much better base improve upon get another update isit seems divided community largely stems fact game different alpha version whether like update anyone expected coming release fact took six years changes also little underwhelming overall would still highly recommend game friends im blast please take reviews grain salt concerned games future imo orignal game seemed polished version still tutorial guide insturctions ever open menu scroll controls new player og would hard time play seems spawn enemies super high level sometimes towns middle nowhere insutruction walk idk happened skills seems radically different definetly improvements awesome additions another great thing steam sum full release ea going shitstorm lot true fans sad disappointed sad first real review made steam sad recommending game others really loved alpha played months released enjoy game changes promised least teased tweets things expecting homerun success game feels like corpse alpha hollow shell game already looking bit meek alpha hooked start even though called meek enough fun enjoyable changes made good improve game lot doesnt feel like cube world know review bit late busy college remembered game winter break happy wollay releases update eating words would change review heartbeat game fell love six years ago enjoying itthings took time adjusting lack basic tooltips left missing key features happened mistake find self coming back game almost dailyregion locking concerned first actually fine really different moving new zone enemies harder current gear fact money special gear carry make bit easier main issue losing transportation items hurts worse new gear grind gameplay really spent time warrior rhythm found class pretty rewarding simple major complex action game engaging movement feels fun tools get like hangglider make getting around interesting really complaint want skills combat see much potential themgear actually love loot treadmills restarting zone feels good really need help new region go back one maxed grind money get good head start adding cubes weapons weirdly fun pets also fun track downside gear straight stats nothing really unique seems pop least didnt seem exploration world unique beauty chance finding random dungeonlootquest didnt see map makes exploring actually fun within region quests basic give enough motivation push forward think region locking actually helps push fully exploring area rather checking major land marks moving get hang gliding boat others really help enrich exploration losing new zone physically slows game much artifacts seem like perma bonuses find fairly lackluster increased small lamp light swimming speed non combat related perks arent terrible feel anticlimatic seem like perfect thing improved add new skills improve skills improve pets anything interesting moment tldr pros pretty game engaging exploration addictive loot grind simple fun gameplay pet animals cons loss exploration tools big drawback regionlocking skillartifacts feel lacking almost guidetips read wikis think pros outweigh cons know getting hopefully dev adjusts things make even better without sacrificing want game enjoying game far glad finally able play believe lot negative reviews people played alpha dislike changes made development maybe expecting triplea game waited long think changes made improve game greatly see people dislike items working specific region think keeps game interesting rather getting best gear unable die make new character game amazing consider price size development team plenty games full tens millions dollar budgets teams hundreds people turn terrible developers amazing job far excited see gameoverall would like people know yes lot changed believe theres better framework future updates imagine devs wanted release something long rather wait longer work updates infinitely long process game like extremely dissapointed title alpha kinda promising roadmap also satisfying nonetheless years wait developer decided drop vision realize something else majority seems unpleased decision ia broken progression system simplfied rpg elements almost nothing left enjoy looks like developer went back silence fairly glad never deleted alpha pcplaying alpha right im lot fun playing thatwollay went wrong think changes good get trapped kind echo chamberwith people affraid giving real feedback worried youd go back hidey hole glad back really miss skill tree going request refund chance get game changes great time exploring game see putting many hours love look feel difficulty fun get around though figure things bad exploration great would recommend game enjoy good exploration game bit actionedit hours still ton fun love exploring zone hunting gear help next zone awesome time cube world bought game alpha stage years back find release version far enjoyable extending play innovations levelling process make feel far invested home zones important infinitely procedurally generated map otherwise overwhelming prospect gear within zone become powerful enough take artefact guardians found challenging exciting boss fights complete solo able use newfound gear start exploring neighbouring zones almost grind explore zone fabulous game look forward goes loving game far endless exploration always something new see one many got game alpha state absolutely loved game enjoyed graphic style leveling system skill tree everything could think gamethe thing still love take consideration game developed two single souls many people may like region lock system get got confused first playing game full release state got absolutely oneshot everytime encountered enemy got used really enjoy game think region lock system good conductor adventureous explore find need find another thing find game much fun play friend consider getting game id recommend making another friend one get game play togetheri really recommend game give devs fighting chance good job guys keep good work posting review someone never played alpha years earlier please bear information incorrectafter six years development limbo due mental health issues described creator game nowdeleted blog post game inspired games runescape minecraft cube world finally lots changed past halfdecade list changes explanation old getting xp system ditched exchange region combat steep difficulty curve getting especially meleecentered classes warrior experienced breeze handle easy targets game asks explore region start dont go may look like mmo see players alas play steam friends theyre onlinein opinion game could still use work especially regionlocking mechanic still recommend aesthetics emphasis exploring voxel world built cubes somewhat enjoyable combat system playing friends recommended sure still breeze playing solo yes know plenty steam guides help tonthe game may rough start la mans sky reassure alpha players wait worth dont like thats fine argue theres always upcoming hytale people looking elsewhere really enjoying game chill fun cute region locked equipment unique feature emphasizes exploration grinding like biggest issue artifacts dont really seem worth maybe finding artifact gave slight boost base combat stats would worth would recommend game people prefer exploring large open world lots different biomes grinding powered possible blitzing dungeons still going recommend game undeniable issues format though hope updates get complete version game less confusing playable still enjoyable keeps feel alpha beta version feel complete allthe first issue noticed fish minor detail blow fish shore could run land something supposed part underwater biome dont believe quite mobile unless youre sea also experience fair amount lag sometimes would run flawlessly next moment would getting around fps alpha get lag game occasionally however still playable generally fine shortened render distance really point borderline unplayable game seems much graphics didnt notice new complex features added would cause additional lag im sure stems unless difference world generation thats another thing miss unending randomly generated biomes might make multiplayer complex keep feature hasnt stopped anyone playing minecraft friends dont like map fully laid decided removes fun could simply exploring biome lock also removes fun exploring certain ways think thered ways get around though changes game made considering description says supposed rpg focus exploration doesnt really feel waywithout skill tree system gaining weapons random drops makes beginning difficult youre weak compared everything else might get legendary weapon might get something around level already also makes harder feel like youre progressing guess im sure really making progress hard read understand biome lock extent however without skill trees random drops dont mesh well together think could keep biome lock changes elsewhere also miss spirit cubes funi still think game lot potential almost feels like another alpha beta update rather full release promised fingers crossed goes way mans sky becomes game everyone hoping updates edit ive gone back play alpha since lagging badly literally get onehit chicken im lucky still installed computer im fun alpha fun official release know problem thoroughly confused amount negative reviews loved cube world alpha love cube world even change equipment progression brilliant move wollay locking equipment region reason continue playing worried starting region things rollover coins material artifacts stay additionally rare gear use adjacent regions strikes perfect balance region reset region continuity amount content things bit staggering already spent hours game cleared regions biome enjoy rpgs especially indie rpgs actually contribute something new genre likely great game cant recommend game enough sad ended like many people waited game come ever since teaser gameplay first shown hyped however say dissapointed understatement gameplay barely evolved new endless system leveling character restarting progress every zone annoying mention buffs get completing dungeons minimal useless good moments lots bad must frustrating thing restarting progress every zone need new gear new weapon restarting level worst part getting transportation takes forever get necessary especially go island region way travel boat ai broken times things complain everyone elses review explains problems think creator good idea start shouldve released edit time didnt many mini changes creator changed core foundation game making something wouldnt bought knew end result backed game day one waited years followed creator twitter sign updates ate screenshots released cannot recommend game current state free alpha version game surprisingly better adjusted design choices made made really poor scaling game good backed game alpha quite surprised got game key try beta years later nice put quite bit time past week see cube world performs say wasnt beta early access release day big update many suspected cube world still lot potential still needs fleshing lot areas years development good enough fixed exp leveling weird self destructive way really benefits new system current state would recommend anyone buy game progression plain simple good worth time much better gaming experiences invest time feel good youve achieved cube world sadly one games shelve months revisit see worth playing yet believe trusting attitude patient attitude go hand hand see let go learn trust releases joy life trust youre able patient patience waiting something wait attitude waiting believe game really great potential personally wish way toggle different leveling systems loot becoming useless different regions mechanic also wish skill tree game could select abilities use class really like cube world bought cube world honestly find alpha fun solo player early game incredibly dull boring without friends beta initially fun opinion grows stale times regions significant meaningful long term progression whether quests gear leveling skill trees buy current state want play friends personally think would paid cube world current state length region exceeds two hours unable refund game decide youve enough one region sorry wollay really asked community input point past years dont make efforts improve game based community feedback lose entire fanbase quickly patience optimism runs dry bought cube world june enjoyed friends remember able barely run pc back thenin alpha version would play get endgame quickly easy outpace friends new design current release forces stop actually explore zones instead stopping smack boss around head next zone restricting gear regions kingdoms itemsim one region game atm im excited pick next region gold persistent regions kingdoms allows buy gear new towns slightly speed low gear lvl grindi comment server travel networking game pretty impressive seamless provides nice experience people coming goingill update press game friends overall nice release bought cube world alpha years ago pretty good update took long time come reasoning delay detailed picroma website regardless cube world still pretty good flaws see reading reviews still lot promise enjoyable play friends serious downside progression alpha levelbased leveled gained skills abilities addition gear increasing quality currently however everything zonebased regardless powerful one zone soon move weak couple exceptions still probably changed bought alpha years ago thinking would like alphasthe developer getting feedback players bug fixing improvements two patches first month minor bugs years interaction alpha players years later game released steam many fun things removed leveling skill trees removed player advancement gear region lock added game makes feel like starting time move new area game released devs gone silent blogs removed feels much like cash grab occurred years agocube world pretty much soured alphas early accessi never participated another one since fiascocash grabmy advice stay away one unless devs come back start putting time effort communication equation holding breath bought alpha years ago played enjoyed time cube worlds current state region locking recommend buying game lack rpg elements make terrible bought alpha years ago liked game finally released must say different still like really like graphical style look world etc game definitely better played friendsim sure future updates since heard anything creator bought alpha version back game wasnt steam even though didnt get updates felt like got moneys worthwith steam release us alpha players got full game free want money back bought alpha version played lot fun game missing things quests habilities powers bosses biomes structures overall great gamenow release steam say things time game region lock system long xp againyes game doenst xp upgrade level collecting almost usless artifactsso basically game biomes structures quests things like mobs lot pets essence cube world died lives alpha versionthe game stills fun cool play friends dowload mods add xp takes region lock system awesome mods easy download useif wanna buy game recommend download mods real experience bought alpha version many years ago way fun current version theres lot potential game fun leveling system insane fun play friend frustrating cant manage find friend play itunless updates game dud bought game knowing regionlock mod disabling regionlock personally like regionlock whatsoever think rather unnecessary regionlock theres existence creating different charactersclasses mind restarting various characters definitely sane regionlock regionlock aside game undeniably fun enjoyable compared first cube world version expansive new although hard get used system get going gameplay pleasant quite dungeons monsters npcs mechanics quite liked experience bought game years ago back alpha incomplete genuinely good time playing first impressions steam release far overall positive take little bit play around get used game find promising id love see community grow along continual updates bought game years ago friends wanted join never actually played followed anything dev released recently steam got key hopped online andi really enjoy ive seeingthen went online check things like pet foods found really angry community whose opinions seemed contradictory opinions game opinion really refreshing approach exploration leveling etc honestly really appreciate fact challenged learn new language playperhaps didnt know anything development dove see lot suggestions game needs improved cant help think would improve end result another levelgrinding mmo mean dont get wrong love well designed skill tree slow grind reach difficult terrain love kind game see cube world could adapted style maybe would wish well led along outset developmentcoming fresh eyes though many wonderful things game style world building mechanics keeping hooked besides still dev im excited see goes know im aware yalls frustration comes hopefully feel deep sense disappointment game changes back another direction shoes current critics lolz bought years ago lot fun im also lot fun changes people upset aboutim optimistic devs fine tune address complaints either way exceeded personal benchmark getting hour enjoyable gameplay dollar spentedit towards end launch day isnt peep devs much want love game wouldnt recommend purchasing proof developer stay time ill likely play little bit ive already alphakey friends lose interest honestly assumed would early access title apparently release bought game years ago wont lie like version lot good faith wollay think things get better bought game years ago first alpha enjoyed time however cant say reviews pretty much stated problem areas ones stand region locked equipment artifacts near useless even though theyre main objective game lack content combat game effectively useless start one shot every enemy aside white green named enemies lower level enemies drop negligible amount gold chance itemi racked enough gold buy armor beefed defenses slightly allowing take maybe one two hits lucky enough find legendary weapon may think happy find instead good time combat became unstoppable killing machine one shotting everything strategyat best game walking simulator youre either boot enemies youre godlike gear resetting every region including travel gear glider boat gives little incentive keep going complete first region youve pretty much experienced everything game offer difference moving new region vs starting new game small increase lantern boat speed artifact providesall im disappointed direction game taken recommend reading indepth reviews get full picture id also recommend looking thru wollays old twitter posts past years see features worked arent present release old roadmap former website good indicator much content could added gave lot hope taken favor new system bought game years ago alpha fun pointless every area takes away everything earn last area game worth money feels like worse idle game please dont buy right nowif still go log account download alpha play friends lot fun bought game years ago eagerly awaiting kind update unfortunately got something cant recommend spending money right bought game years ago changed lot since opinion changed better found new version enjoyable get first hour cant get new leveling system game isnt think worth try personally highly recommend game bought game years ago somehow original alpha state better gigantic pile shit wollay tried pass cube world way enjoy game community mods playing alpha version either way wollay still con man years ago vanished like avatar needed bought game around price years ago alpha came giving positive review think dollars well spent although probably find games give content bucks game likely give average player hours gameplay get bored run progressionrepetitiveness problems game currently bucks think hours game fun combat mechanics unique character abilities atmospheric environment cant find anywhere else trove doesnt nearly come close enough worth money however different everyone take said good game much entertainment game provides judge whether warrants price tag bought game back wish everyone could play gamei wish game developed slightly put everyone buy loved old game im sad game turned wish didnt post review game suckssss bought game back alpha stages development like lot peoplethe alpha beautiful demo amazing game despite systems simple concepts shown world created much potentialbeing little cube dude running around killing stuff getting stronger little direction brought back memories old days games nostalgiaand thats people angry built perception grand game going gifted future game would make feel way first major
