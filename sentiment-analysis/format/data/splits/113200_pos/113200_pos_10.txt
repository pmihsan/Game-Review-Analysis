tends pass time pretty well good stuff fun game play sec four hour montage awesome game played fun cant wait next one like thisthisis amazing bosses hard makes game replayable want win tis good tis good tldr actual negative review isaac story unnecessarily dark leads polarizing audience game would actual game controller support dumb personally seems repetitive regardless rougelike elements got boring fast binding isaacs story highly juvenile fact im seeing people call story good making scratch head isnt good dark themes game highly unnecessary game really rougelike dungeon crawler game sure newgrounds feel missing humor instead dark comedy vive like thought going seems lot focused dark part story almost like trying taken seriously time parts makes funny laughable time course youre probably wondering im harping story much obviously purpose game reason way story seems polarize audience one side either caring story liking theyre hardcore atheists like anything antireligion side people arent comfortable story feel distracting game polarization seems unnecessary since story minor part game feel like game could still unique identity different storythe binding isaac really nothing wrong mechanically though fact controller support people dont want download separate program play game controller game really controller game keyboard controls feel awkward hell besides might even rougelike elements game feels repetitive bored pretty quickly rather mediocre topdown rogue action game dark humor keep returning minute dont feel like anything complex time consuming would absolutely skip wasnt sale still recommended reasonable price youre looking simple casual game easy get intotoo long partbstory playing isaac little kid whose mom nuts wants kill descends trap door room fight way creepy places creepy monsters bgameplay simple hard master controls depends anyones taste game economy shtload upgrades active skills consumables discovered upgrade skill interesting fun mess around tempting google way better fun pick something see levels randomized lot various monsters bosses spice things wont play game way twice point view game offers infinite replayability fact
