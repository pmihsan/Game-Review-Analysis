despite steep learning curve wont take long player get hang though ever master different question game hundreds unique interesting items large effects upon gameplay even many bosses randomised degree numerous unlockables also wonderful effect upon replayability various endings keep coming back morethe soundtrack composed danny baranowsky one personal favourites worth picking wrath lamb expansion pack game adds hundreds new items new levels new ending new characteroverall binding isaac absolute masterpiece cannot recommend enough ah old testament longer weirder part christianitys holy

potentially endless number combinations item pickups alter characters abilities ranging basic health damage upgrades items completely change base attack something powerful games interesting draw unfortunately wears reason taking train work every morning doesnt become thrilling activity put different socks todayas much might whine issue isnt mcmillens drawings basic lack interesting things game dont get wrong love shooting lasers eyes im mostly killing giant blowflies room room need something little interesting give reason stay ithe binding isaaci ultimately game doesnt look good doesnt play smoothly even fourdirectional aiming fuck awful totally retro generally isnt interesting though guess admire style themes sort tries tackle enough save sinking ship especially ultimately doesnt get right either short want get real appreciation biblical nightmare creatures child abuse go real church instead ah classic indie smash hit binding isaacnow start review wanna say something enjoy playing game suck like lotthe biggest problem binding isaac harsh treats die back square one almost literally reinforces good gameplay habits meaning need try harder harder get games last dungeon also havent even beat game havent even gotten close thats much suck game yet still blast playstorywise picture like margaret white carrie carrie isaac also naked doesnt psychic powers experiences zeldastyled dungeons lotsa crap metaphorically literallythe best part game basic gameplay alone youve ever played zelda link past youll great understanding games mechanics controls behave binding isaac like hybrid original legend zelda nes link past snes still original creative also controls feel slippery kind like super meat boy know im goingoverall fan games similar classic topview legend

whether youre fan indie pretty much indie title plus game relatively skill based good contributes far get could mention flaws honestly ive typing long list short even bother hours vs price big mac think ahhh binding isaac zelda dark souls love child say without exageration game stunning amount depth new player thrown game knowing literally nothing moving shooting quaddirectional way items descriptions often obscure understand true effect learned experimenting enjoy fact know nothing game enjoy learning experience hard game insanely high skill cap reason die hundreds times beating final

deserves music gloomy yet amazing graphics bring nostalgia items abilities pretty sweet ideas brought religious undertones game bring really dark theme theres much deeper meaning game running around crying things wont spoil anything youll look things online highly recommend game dlc well worth three games fun little games interesting backstory good time waster free time allmost endless replayability game easy get doesent cost much almost casual game play round two laptop waiting something else sadly become bit slow due flash engine overall enjoyable randomly generated demons dungeons gamethe random element really make games hardnot favour land strong weapons abilities early usually pretty cheap never play game twice almost good ass almost good canned bread almost good tacos almost rewarding painful every possible level prepare roll dice badly almost infinitely replayable super cheap definitely worth money alone dark unexpectable deadly basementisaac full fun action pack variaty enemies itemsi recommend bithardcore arcade game get deeper horrorart style overall design also pretty lovelyi dont know say addict flash game time alot replayabilty still worth playing shame dont see people uploading videos og game alright game tons replay ability great time waster alright let tell something came rebirth dont assume rebirth new mechanics new items base game binding isaac still beautiful really recommend buying game beautiful yes doesnt look great really masterpiece also note getting wrath lamb dlc add lot actual game doesnt look great trust awesome game alright know new one better one remake made definately doesnt mean dismiss first one still play one fell love start rating would definatly give get also good weird little hard anyway although may fully recommend gamethat mainly people buying wholethis game fun action packed topdown video game many references classic games first legend zeldabegginers hard time never played shooting walking controls useful times frustrating sometimes feel either much hearts dont need little get things like chocolate milk charge based fire item upgrades seem dont need health blasting rooms give game little ive played far lots fun power ups extra powerup dlc cheap get even fun bucksbosses normal mobs hard balenced lots cool item rooms reference roomscons much health go around faster enemies flies evil game although wasnt really exposed metroidvania style games kid sega nintendont always fan horror monsters picked playing dying times dying times finally beat game unlocked characters called day week two pass decide pick game start exploring rooms instantly walled little miniboss one seven deadly sins die start get dungeon little trouble head boss room im immediately confronted little freak riding horse decides tramples death turns difficulty jumped time skills degraded break reset data reset difficulty realized late would unlock characters uninstalled game bout ragequit point game casual player binding isaac boi make cry knash teeth pull hair get good feel game even game appropriately makes difficult keep dedicated play coming back recently buying roguelike games decided give game another try time though playing frequently skills improving steady rate needless say hooked aside bug doesnt register achievements steam short term fix excellent game insane amount replayability variety art style keep coming back although rebirth better recommend would get one instead binding isaac still extremely fun hard although better version game come original binding isaac still pretty good game game kind hard still manages fun gameplay reminds original legend zelda although runthrough doesnt tend last hour binding isaac real addictive game interesting story behind binding issac recommendation would make others play okay starting gameplay isnt dungeons rooms enemies loot abilities arent place previous game might get lucky run played first two times game get rather tricky tackling boss stages using money trouble however youre games doesnt tend last long sweet abilities sometimes feel powerful weak think must play although difficult game actually enjoy time playing although simple dualstick shooter binding isaac represents blend progressive roguelike traits frustrates amuses gameplay trimmed essential number buttons need incredibly small focus game mastering various elements within actual game game incredibly difficult times unfair upgrades bosses monster spawns room layout typically determined rng game absolutely screw perfect run really tough room boss either way game cripplingly addictive mastery game simple yet deep mechanics continue bring back although ive played bit great game like creepy arcade games game although playhours may seem small game fantastic game many people said missing dont get also insane replayability value lets honest fun game although poorly optimized due limitations flash game legitimate fun worth hours frustration although game buggy times frame rate issues due fact made flash still fun rewarding game play challenging start unlock items later runs learn attack patterns enemies items suit becomes easier progress farther run even experienced players getting final boss beating run challenge randomly generated floors add lot replayability excellent game team meat although game completely outclassed sequel cant ignore rootsthat would like ignoring grandparents disrespectfulso yeah pretty sweet game always good time even isnt always new kind fun always fun pick play run two always love newground games comedy art style way powerups change isaacs appearance even story quite funny ill save isaac wont let keel yew always provides player new challenging fun levels every playthrough making replayable game even
