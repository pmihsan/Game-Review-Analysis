gameplay sh involves going around island climbing peak ie going hike plus unless insist finding secrets reaching zenith fairly short wrapped game hours going back explore everything missed might take another hour however additional mechanics give simply trek check sights since play bird person youre able glide jumping combines quite well mountainous terrain youre also able fish various bodies water dig goods speak locals helping basic fetch quests rewards rather simple theres enough areas interest scattered around wont walk far coming across something controls walking main mechanic sh

im sure triggers get enough golden feathers sustain longer glide youll notice song change stay glide several seconds contrast climbing upwards pros simple gameplay pretty charming able casually switch fishing exploring nice freedom nothing committal sh plus gliding around surprisingly fun gather decent amount golden feathers sufficient stamina deal requirement without difficulty good reward finding several like dialogue characters written seems genuine believable doesnt hurt npcs either nice funny cons appreciate compass without map kind useless bit difficult figuring things relation one another find something youre looking theres also tracking system fetch quests like although liked ending sh actually get end card credits misses mark ever slightly think triggered conversation aunt would poignant games selling price pretty steep short experience tips im quite used jumping letting go button tapping get glide start climbing sh want get habit holding button right pushing useful whether climbing gliding youre able save quit time dont worry losing progress duck early final thoughts sh good job capturing enjoyable parts walking simulators atmospheric enough maintain interest assuming
