old blood wasnt sequel new order smaller scope taking hours complete meant played coop played almost entire game solo wasnt terribly burdensome though course ai wasnt quite useful human playerit plays awful lot like remember new colossus playing stealth option sneaking around silently murder nazis extremely satisfying often youre going get caught shoot way area weapons signature machine games look feel sound great look great theyre effective except youngblood added layer armor almost every enemy armor broken shotgun submachine gun squishier targets armor broken heavier stuff assault rifle pistol first annoyed system never quite felt great big enemies force use different weapons different situations biggest problem weapons squishy targets armored targets seemed armored enemies squishy didnt get much fun every weaponthe structure game reminiscent dishonored small handful mission areas bulk early game visiting areas repeatedly complete shortish tasks example youll go one area make way mechanics garage find item kill particular enemy either pick new mission area go back hub safe area result bulk game small missions areas repeatedly four major assaults nazi strongholds big missions still whole lot narrative completed handed another small mission go back even big mission areas get reused new colossus sending back maps youve already finished get xp currency much bigger gamethe two places game fails narrative failing exploit setting theres lengthy cutscene start lengthy cutscene finish three five major missions short cutscene beat boss thats isnt whole lot motivating narrative little missions youre taking nazi strongholds fairly sharp contrast new order new colossus rather competent storytelling particularly painful uncompelling absentee antagonist prior games great wellwritten awful antagonistsits also nominally dont expect shopping malls aerobics new wave cant throw around glasses vhs tapes cassettes collectibles make enough nazioccupied paris absolutely fascinating instead indistinguishable game depicting fascist occupation rubble concrete big nazi robots theres even radios playing fascist pop music made game get listen finding cassette collectibles

boss wouldnt spongy weak enemies would die one hit lived reputation opinion merciless gun play blasting dozens enemies time importantly story kept engagedvisually okay settings environments rife exploring good variety gunsone slight annoyance found going back areas previously cleared enemies completed missions found needed new missions area guess developers trying increase campaign play time without increasing map size look game aint bad hold tno tob tnc meant fun spin title rather borderlandsy got levelling system mostly consists kill heap nazis side quests make kill heaps nazis story incredibly short references heap events havent even happened main series yet tad surprising confusing points though fairly predictable otherwise length padded requiring side quests story connection bit times need bethesda account online invites steam could find unfortunatelyhonestly wanna run around kill nazis pal bad time near good titles series aint bad get sale looter shooter mechanics microtransactions forced franchise doesnt work lothar brandt nothing wrong love everything could ask stand alone fps multiplayer game loved game got final boss wasnt hard annoying unfulfilling meh odd power suits many types enemies bullet sponge enemies health barsmeh negative reviews exaggerated picky overall great game especially played friend must least attractive game ever tried least major
