level design bulletspongey nazis makes zero sense essentially borderlands without loot without fun shallow repetitive beyond belief shame using tropes years ago nothing short lazy narrative short shortsided rewarding gameplay compelling reasons gameplay needing second person open doors continue trope old first came nothing short absolute insult call wolfenstein friendly ai pathfinding aweful nothing short absolute disgrace game essentially running around fighting nazis nonstop exactly wolfenstein game bemany enemies barrier depleted efficiently particular weapon types doesnt make reallife sense laser gun instantly melts heavy lightly armored trooper barriers combined weapon mastery system encouraged use tools arsenal melee stealth powerful options ai partner strong contributor battle usually comes revive right awaywith exception brief cutscenes beginning end game maintain full control character even go menu fiddle loadout conversations npcs right approach firstperson gamethe rpgstyle leveling serves little purpose areas initially contain highlevel enemies impossible fight go missions elsewhere long enemies game scaling making entire system superfluous get damage bonus level questionable benefit know enemies might gaining damage resistance case bigger numbers create illusion progress solutions make later story areas inaccessible players finish preparatory missions give skill points completing objectives remove level numbers every enemys head stop making experience points pop enemy killed another pointless frill since players way verify much experience required reach next levela cons including virtual currency purchased real money reason nothing cheapen brand cant pause game mission checkpoints far fewoverall youngblood flawed fun experiment stars game good solid gameplay like previous wolfenstein games dont understand people say enemies spongie pretty much kill normal enemies pretty fast tallking elite enemies big armor even previous wolfenstein titles pretty tough kill makes sense game perfectly optimized issues whatsoever playing gtx peoople say girls annoying honest much far seen try microtransactions yet dont think game requires unless want upgrade weapons ability quickly still neccesary dont want tomy complain game feel little focus wants mean went half looter shooter fps experience think result good experience works something similar
