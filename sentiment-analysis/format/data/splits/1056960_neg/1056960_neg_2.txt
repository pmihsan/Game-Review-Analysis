taskshow fucking clear guidanceconsider stupid design glad pay full price game sucks ass thought going like last one great singe player story experiencebut online bullshit right hate games going days makes feel like playing fortnight online piece shit gameplease keep great single player games alive go game mindset like shadow warrior big breakaway previous installments fun friend without expecting previous gameswell everything reallyi wouldnt really call stuff pick loot standard ammo health armor lottttt collectibles thats bethesda fucking rolls youre picking like variable powerups variable weapons dont understand everyone calls looter shooter pick ups previous games lot unlock certain areaschestsunfortunately bullet spongey enemies thing true spend good amount ammo shooting enemies unless theyre super basic ones went system like shadow warrior enemies take certain bullet types however shadow warrior could make weapon certain elemental type could actually use weapons like versus enemies element plus many weapon variants type weapon let play wanted rather bring certain weapon see certain enemythe main story like missions something super low short shit kind disappointing like old blood level disappointing length rest time spent side missions mildly looking collectibles since get upgrade shows mini map however didnt go way way get definitely achievements related grinding various waysleveling weaponscharacterfinding collectibles theressomanykilling enemies certain wayswhile upgrade weapon want sights extended clip maybe suppressor rapid fire doesnt really feel like matters long dont pick head shot damage upgrade cause feels underwhelming shit go straight damage insane fire ratei understand negative reviews game however lets remind people dont preorder dont know youre getting dumb pieces shit want blame developers different studio bulk work painfully obvious spin title waited small amount time even one fucking day youd able see game played would fingertips look paid money game shit cant stand throwing money games favorite names attached didnt preorder could googled game play reviews really good understanding game enough people knew getting bought met expectations low still gonna refund managed release game bad unpolished good game killing nazi scum good game coop boring singleplayer got bored hours likely wont play end got given far cry new dawn treatment fucking terrible gotta say dont know supposed got game really excited potential going paris virtual space mostly sense prefer spending money plastic junk manufactured third world country rather growing spine save actually travel myselfwhat oh yeah video game paris ever since saw juliet binoche random french film like years ago ive really wanted go film dont remember busy staring eyes cheekbones really pay attention unfortunately tour misguided lady intercom running tour sounds charming enough keeps inhabit one two annoying siblings embody kill bunch foreigners mean heard french werent welcoming tourists jesus idea got violent thembut ok thought killing bunch germans decked robot armor probably coming theyre likely aggressive bankers bmw salesmen feel like im forgetting really nasty political group germans used follow anyway digging seeing paris germancyborgcorpse blood soaked filter unfortunately tour cut short multiple times fiddle encrypted floppy discs randomly placed collectables wanted tech repair wouldnt dropped school purchase gaming pc though guess relate main characters hoarding boat loads cassettes ill meet halfway thereall couple hours interactive paris footage sink teeth poor pacing noticeable lack juliet binoche cheekbones cant recommend definitive paris video game experience youre better spending money binoche film dvd definitely godzilla though shes like five minutes graphics good upgrading weapons skills great gameplay terrible wander around fight enemies youve gone repetitive eventually become boring elevator cctv scenes annoying wolfenstein without bj boring need go back linear narrative choices affects story goes great coop play decent story bad want play well great funfor worrying rpg style hp bars consider enemies older games also hp values never saw took different levels damage kill either way shoot normal use powers kick crap nazi enemies find friend great coop game great game devs responsive game solid read

es una muy buena experiencia para jugar cooperativo online fue necesario ajustar parametros graficos ya que inicialmente corria de forma adecuada el juego en si es muy bueno recomendable finished game single player one would enhanced playing multiplayer good gun play fun though bullet sponge enemies using rifle often notsuit powers fun able pick ones want nice still good looking game goring enemies still satisfying ok sound quality good hiccups someone would start repeating quest dialog saying standing next hubdid graphical glitch people referring making mention badwell point beat around bush mtx present consumables still using game silver sure issues machine purpose delay tested felt slowed farm areas get enough coin skins wanted want wolf game story mediocre essentially repeat task times slight variations characters enough said sometimes good mostly campy bad writing overall regrets picking release would recommend waiting sale otherwise would recommend game shorter wolf game thanks readingjono finished previous two wolf reboots expected continue trend sadly real misfire coop thing interest let cpu control player mostly useless leaving work isnt however biggest fault game short isnt fun enemies right get go normal difficulty boring bullet sponges many take entire magazines head never skip beat yet couple shots meaning spend much time ground hoping useless cpu character come pick dull stuff theres really variation either endless waves enemies take far many bullets take thumbs dud honestly dont know game getting much hate bought game read many negative reviews really hesitant buying game really cant form opinion unless buy play game self playing game would recommend heres whypositives amazing graphics sound design made newest id tech level design linear go many
