explanation twins get powersuitsno explanation friend isno explanation three got nazi controlled parisenemies bullet sponges also either complete pushovers lower difficulties gods war higher settings inbetweenspeaking terrible ai make horrific mistake playing game solo count ai controlled sister much anything follow around shoot enemies go whatever reason hit give revive youafter ai sister failed revive fifth time uninstalled requested refundbethesda never list right next easave money save time go something else anything else play trash heap kill good saga put level health bar ennemies destroy infiltrationwill finish paid doesnt deserve price huck faters game lot fun isnt linear wolfenstein ala previous games still huge dose nazi killing large maps great especially dishonored fan biggest downside lack badass metal tunes go hand hand nazi killing huge disappointment wolfenstein went storyline whatever kill things type game every aspects game flawed complete let least one thing right game cost full retail price huge disappointment pre ordered game soon announced thinking good previous titles boring enemies fight every area take million bullets kill dont grind upgrade weapons stats story pretty much non existent dialogue characters awful want great game hours im fun enjoyment playing wolfenstein game friend edit hours later worst game ever played really boring thing build non existent final part game big reveal awful final boss shit wish could get money back absolutely adore game think people dislike wrong reasons starters game wolfenstien different titles make game bad think phenomenal gameplay stellar graphics clunky systems game pretty damn great definitely worth price dont come strict expectations actually enjoy game couple hours hit first boss fight complaints poor companion ai bullet sponge enemies lousy checkpoints hit time unfortunately didnt happen three four hours game doubt ill able get refundduring boss fight boss fires continuous streams missiles aoe damage companion ai likes stand open getting hit go downed state continue stand middle aoe getting shot choice letting die uses one shared lives dying trying revive uses shared life another ai ends dying boss giant enemy soaks massive amount damage barely moving around open arena boss fight takes place theres cover since firing missiles usually fire side cover still damage occasionally regular bullet sponge enemy spawn walk around slowly shooting soaking even ammoand die get reset start level good fifteen twenty minutes earlierim sure leveled side missions boss might much problem according level system already leveled recommended level game going use sort leveling system expect least aware assigning missionsi want like game thought negative reviews overstating ai bullet sponge nature enemies wish negative reviews wrong werentalso softhard armor system enemies ends annoyance anything else weapon switching feels slow compared fps youre constantly switch weapons soft hard armor damage imagine designers wanted players playing coop one person dealing one armor type maybe youre playing someone cooperate system irrelevantthe game look nice runs well least actually liked game graphics nice fighting lot fun protagonists bit annoying bad gunplay works fine new nonlinear way game structures something youll get used generally quite fun especially friend however one thing almost completely kills fun times three towers youll slay way get killed somewhere along way likely especially fight towers boss enemy gotta whole thing woohoo lemme fifteen twenty minutes pretty terrible especially one time died tower boss ai companion refused revive even though wouldve easily able worst thing final boss may expect two phase boss fight first phase damage behind guess side almost never got see finally got phase two whole thing made lot harder fact whole arena chock full standard enemies giving almost place hide bullets probably lot easier friend ai dumber box rocks partner still quite bother conclusion wanna go slay nazis buddy please go maybe wait sale want play game alone think twice recommend game first foremost although exclusively people got friend play want play alone well meh lot fun bad times regret buying end big fan last two wolfenstein games one removed two key features made love games opponents bullet sponges every two minutes shoot opponents way many times die finally move accuracy headshots seem count anymore good shotgun shoot every second opponent around ten times dies makes feel powerless stretches battles point become boring first time wolfenstein game looking forward battle alarm goes pity brilliant shooter feeling two main characters almost every character saw far annoying teenagers andor boring nothing compared well written characters previous wolfenstein parts makes hard identify characters play get emotionally involved story playing story keep feeling would better lay gun get shot teenage girls could annoy bore anymorei could live bad story terrible teenage characters cant live fact destroyed brilliant shooter feeling really hope change back wolfenstein please severly disappointed game many much sad bought youngblood sale loved old blood new order new colossus short version like youngblood several reasons main character twins unlikable im real difficulties tearing female characters sexualized girls basically genderswapped bro dudes annoying moon back stealth always hard wolfenstein games doable put effort made enjoyable youngblood stealth impossible cannot game offers choice use stealthy mechanics puts many situations obviously designed enable stealthy anything whats enemy discovers suddenly chore kill fire guns somehow even enemies city blocks away instantly know impossible cloak escape situation enemies calm try must destroy right chance escape stealth points im finding game terribly disappointing dont know studio focused much coop feature didnt put effort anything else comparison last wolfenstein entries game bad bought game refunded play return wolfenstein pretend bs never happened came game optimistic read mixed reviews saw people fun playing coop gave hopei played game start friend stopped hours miserable starting cutscenes longer needed large margin characters downright unlikeablebut things overlooked skip cutscenes tune dumb voicelines main characters saywhat makes game straight awful gameplaystealth option significantly difficult stealthily clear level game wolfenstein game silenced pistol doesnt headshot grunts unless armor silence assault rifle thing doesnt even headshot people modification set bonus makes damage headshots enjoyed sneaking around base killing nazis stealthlike fun gamethe mission structure broken go location x thing run back fast travel point repeat get detected guards alert youre making way back fast travel point stuck level cannot progress kill every nazi immediate area isnt bad keep spawning also levels kind openworldish sense new player game run extremely high level nazis absolute bullet sponges feels gross coming game kill every nazi see getgo vs play hours infiltrate area games unlock new fun ways gore

heavy weapons weapons big guys drop enough ammo kill like gruntsits huge fucking headache could go hopefully ive already convinced game worth time moneydo buy game neither really recommend recommend kept getting crash dump error every time tried boot game shame really looking forward playing see trying game accounts worked falls flat almost every turn combat lackluster enemies feel spongey leveling system makes feel worse rather better previous games better guns brought faster kills fueled enjoyment game feel like upgrade weapons able even play game metroidvania open world design

useful gives one pick grants xpi would like able listen cassete tapes walking ingame though listen menusome people issues connecting games ive hosted sure isp sht cant say expected classic wolfenstein new order game coop sadly game meet expectations far margin wants borderlands without loot added microtransactions poorly executedboth friend actually struggling even finish game boring fear little bit buy game couse negative reviews finished missions aint understand ppl thinks bad yea maybe weakest part modern wolfenstein series bad game u love playing modern ones probably u aint hating one one two count friend similar opinion think great bethesda machine games mixing trying combinations games outside comfort zone im guy hours doom im nuts classic fps basically care guess first read youngblood going never expected wolfenstein sounds like alot people thought otherwise maybe thats friend total blast running amok youngblood everyone else losing shit loli meanits basically combat collossus mixed enemy mechanics closer division world loot mechanics dishonored obviously anyone wants true wolfenstein episode isnt quite going get game wasnt wolfenstein banner reviews would much higher like random shooter claiming like fear somethingis repetative yes im guy play fps games maybe repetition doesnt affect menow reasonable sold maybe id harsher ive heard people talk microtransactions wtf talking lol got cosmetic armor almost every one bought game coins without silver bars gives shit anyway youve got human teammate voice com fun hell get laugh dialogue metalheads weve hit bosses obliterated us problem killing hundred nazis coming back stronger ever dont feel need plow story missions endless line id rather muck sideline missions thought fun slaughter said youngblood serious ai issues mainly giant dogs seem get stuck everything barely react used terrified nothin alot reminds happened rage game serious gamebreaking problems mainly fixed complaints short seemed silly really go everything map got alotta killing done alot hours guess care slaughter beating game thats meobviously expectations roof high youngblood well expectation terrible thing learned batman vs superman prometheussad anything said makes sense buy game join friend rowdy gunfights think nonsense theres nothing say would make difference im gonna recommend guys like im gonna get back game hate game boring dull two lesbians sisters great though guess problems game feel like older wolfenstein game justice game ill make pros cons listprosmobility boost jumping sliding dashing make character mobilegraphics dont confuse animationsgore consrpg system wolfenstein game rage iitakedowns stealth takedowns time character pulls melee weapon hit enemy itcharacters blazkowiczs daughters made kill nazis blazkowicz everything attitude soldier daughters treat war like gamebugs seen happened takedowns also impacted bugsside quests way many dont feel connected story wayanimations animations npcs speak like animations fallout skyrim feels animatedatmosphere new colossus citizens streets mission fire extinguisher dont see open world gamedual wielding games allowed player dual wield anything allowed dual wield pistols even costs perk point major problem dual wielding anything part games charmsome things cons list like rpg system might reason would want game im system never wolfenstein series formula changed drastic way mixed bag game positive negative ill get negative way since somebody reading reviews would want know firstthe characters play pair twin year old girls dont problem gender problem act like year old girls incredibly annoying makes wish silent protaganist general attitude would something expect person going disneyland rather fighting killingthey often goofing taking entire situation lightly example loading screen elevator dancing playing games badly immersion breaking heading take base commanders mecha soldiers making references situation like fictional spy novels fans etc bad way say enjoying game able take targets wish open world way map still sectioned big enough bad level experience impacts damage well enemies damage level adds perks get leveling adds quickly health armor pools take lot weapons feel solid enough fun gib nazi heavy weapon enjoyed wolfenstein games since original dos games many great hours enemy territory say upset game loved idea dual female characters execution bad often annoying play constant going back areas boring combat excitingin lost interest game neat beginning starting enjoy opening story hour two boredom kicked hours game done expected game wolfensteinlike bringing two teenager characters annoying stupid comments bring feeling old game played hour uninstalled requested refund never cared much long reviews keep short straight point game wolfenstein feeling mostly random missions contribute nothing campaign example would annoying rpg heathbar game ridiculously short hours forced play one two annoying teenage girls quite frankly fit game bethesda prehaps could made work poorly introduced feel place know sjwaspect hotly debated forums thought would give take please stop trying feminize games general problem female main characters give games instead destroying old games like wolfenstein game filled bugs peculiar reason bethesda decided add microtransactions fullpriced game opinion never ok given chance would requested refund ground alone game uses combat system previous wolfenstein games make parts game enjoyable adds nothing series summarize stay away game cannot even recommend diehard fans wolfenstein due cons listed sure wolfenstein survive disaster game never regretted purchase one idea hardware game even lowest settings screen turns static mess basically see tv cable never happen even graphically demanding games played max setting graphically intense enough cause run around fps lower also like everyone else says enemies bullet sponges companion ai nothing sit wait kill enemies played intro mission visited first area point impossible talk longevity game whole say things ongameplay wise youd expect new colossus difference mostly new progression system start certain skills youd expect played games already like body slamming double jumping important added verticality new maps also miss certain things need get like ability use heavy weapons dont start diesel gun laser cutter new electric gun used open different areas unlocking doors adds whole expanded maps revisit timethis ties perk leveling system general main new feature added levels level enemies em meaning higher levels nazis kick harder try prevent moving certain areas whatever level killing dealing damage mostly fairly quick perk points awarded theres tech tree things like dual wielding heavy weapons carrying ability health armor buffs mobility upgradesthe second aspect progression weapon upgrades used collectibles upgrade tokens silver coins find em everywhere combined quests seasoned player rack em fairly fast coins spent weapon modifications alter damage range stability stats whatnot also spent cosmetic skins new thing weapons characters skinned ive already seen people complain microtransaction yes game seems premium currency tacked onto yes microtransactions mostly solo game means way consist grind skipper op weapons since theres competitive gamemode striclty cosmetic isnt game mind youregarding coop aspect play one two twins afaik times game ive seen people complain already people cant actually read played game even past intro sequence mean multiplayer start game set matchmaking solo offline online private thats ai partner almost unnoticeable good way ai partner cannot blow cover essentially cloaked combat deals much damage tanks much damage maybe even often outlive go revive moment call death part one thing problem stack three sister lives find containers idea sister life instant revive go self bleed self revive sister life wait die use one sister lives left restart checkpointif get stuck really bad situation easily lose three lives revives spot next enemies id rather got rid sister lives added option bleed restart checkpoint realize got wrong instead losing lives reserveregarding maps story might everyones favorite feels bit like tried go teenage stranger things sort remember thing pushed hard like stranger things becomes annoying tone might seem people immaturity girls relevant story literally year old twins contrast dark setting end part wolfenstein style taken seriously remember seth roth jewish mastermind magic jewish underwater cave magic jewish artefacts power armor firebreathing robot dogs rightall youd expect wolfenstein aesthetically great soundtrack great acting writing quality tried expand game making less linear mixing elements looter shooters greatly expanded maps get revisit missions secrets side quests pop run havent played game honestly hearing everyone complain isnt single player wolfenstien game typical gameplay bucks barely anyone research anything game game marketed coop spin usual typical nazi killing game honestly minis research tell lol either way agree game sucks golden bars exist cant recommend game fair play friend still worth time opinionthe
