end spending lot time ammo trying defeat level reach objective stealth combat almost impossible lost quick fast paced gun battles end revisiting place complete side task build enough player strength continue story line disappointed glad purchased game discount summer sale nothing new game played games series ai annoying sister keeps standing front wont revive half time pep talk sisters gets really annoying first hour trying find way around confusing help map except useless circle map top screen missions keep sending back areas becomes grind nothing said game said beforebut repeatannoying characters terrible writing way story dont know happened writing team one maybe got high exactly enemies weapons skills last game new notable editions abysmal level design much much worse last game step new order old blood rpg lite mechanics make want stop playing every turn wolfenstein never meant sort system gameplay quite literally ultimate breaking point game stops playing certain sections level makes enemies bullet sponges stupid ammo system dumb makes shotgun feel like peeshooter switch weapons small big squares appear enemies health bar add strategy feel good constantly stop shooting use crappy pistol instead meaty shotgun overall favour dont buy game unless like masochist want experience dying franchise ok managed play end stupid save system die whole level optional missions bringing locations boring interesting concept sister armour etc without shadow doubt worst wolfenstein date games bought steam game ever returned rarely felt need post review game cannot pause game
