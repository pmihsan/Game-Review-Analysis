idea instead sticking original idea med kits open crates get used lives back magic crates see thats bollocks characters obviously idea game coop somebody else single player quite clearly focus ai character useless apart whistling coughing doesnt much else example cloaks necessary cloaked walks stealth kills nothing clear focus coop say single player better idea pick character play solo im telling ibj fucking blazkowiczi one son would better two daughters olistno commentolist cant comment music dont like music games game movie want listen music ill olistso recommend youngblood game dont get excited looking forward game long dont urge play case wolfenstein titles played maybe time wolfenstein franchise come end b emtpy wolfenstein series one alltime favorites time pretty much going motions old times sake decentish gunfightsthe game hollow hate open world system hate focus multiplayer worst part plot honestly know supposed cheesy went full rword game dialogues weak gems little details surprises linear game lets put game result feels soulless empty uninspired almost see development time money went server maintenance yeah wish still played bj get going sisters didnt work due ridiculously short weird plot honestly feels like moneygrab theres like hours plot material spread sparsely reach hour mark still subpar nothing game stands outdidnt feel pressured buying ingame currency didnt feel like progression capped somehow nothing scammy basicallythe gameplay honestly fine could better could worse youre side missions stuff going cakewalk think ive lost one two shared lives throughout whole game singleplayer armor type system sort annoying invest upgrades doesnt really matter think supposed add new layer gunplay ended annoying rock shoe critical would definitely missed elevator doors opening simulator caution please note really interested buying remember following buy coop buy sales use buddy pass friend could play games demo version bokay forward note idea make coop shooter bases upon interesting campaign environment gunplay quite interesting wolfenstein series definitely gunplay large ocean opportunities gameplay eg different enemies course storytelling suffers large losses coop oriented game however cares game fun buddy also essential coop makes everything fun really cannot understand youtubers bought game single player purposes accuse fun give spoiler game awful points armor mechanic largest issue game ridiculous stupid mocks gameplay completely enemies two types armor squares go heavy armor rectangles go believe light armor weapons also rectangles squares weapon corresponds toa specific armor type order kill opponent need pick correct weapon problem squares weapons totally ineffective rectangles load full shotgun clip enemy would still alive getting worse dieselcraftwerk explosions cannot efficiently kill enemies square armor moreover imagine blast way command post hold square weapon first enemy rectangles run away switch weapon enemies switched positions need switch weapon back die lot simultaneously attacked two enemies different armor type sounds funny reality game majority playtime changing weapons core mechanic spawns issue game enemies spawn nowhere especially break stealth appear right nose add issues endless spawns sewers section enemies spawning spawning cleared hallway spawn behind backs minutes senseless killing understood end addition exit level section note travel hideout leaving district traveling inside location game respawn enemies clean location way objective fight enemies way back addition cannot fasttravel enemies near sometime need clean whole location leaving really boring fighting enemies location multiple times side missions often require return location times take note enemies spawn points types random design new colossus new order months new colossus young blood years weapons enemies exact design game feature new enemies moreover old ones exact design possible technology advance even terms design maybe laziness two new weapons one uzi second tesla cannon technically enemies imported right new colossus gameplay sound impact really beefy fire correct weapon course stealth hilarious correct skills simply run like crazy throw axes knives people also invisible also funny efficient weapon humans melee one two shots everything point cosplaying chivalry worked better gunplay played hard gameplay boring forced destroy endless waves enemies thing entertained us hilarious clunky animations also leveling doesnt feature anything special unique typical stuff like armor etc one thing higher difficulties enemy two levels higher shotted even full health interactions players opening doors activate switches dancing reviving thats tight cooperation plot characters stupid illogical dad missing need visit paris takedown three super towers also like twins notice reason according shape house one room nobody noticed abi came reason william disappear also lazy cant find logical reason gone say hes gone missing doesnt want found always nobody cares helicopter flies near zeppelin paris twins quite disgusting behaviour one really weird laughs jokes like ten years old kid second one seriously lacks character development simply exists plot needs twist characters disappear completely vanish protagonists make illogical stuff germans always criengie cartoonish typical evil speeches right tv shows lets honest nobody cares plot game exists know william disappeared need find meanwhile something something important impact world conclusion bad even coop game know coop makes everything fun would say guns sound impact pluses game even customization save disaster buy different skins cares wearing coop players cant devoted one gun either forced often switch concluding game cashgrab effort developed without understanding good coop shooter happy players met negatively could safe lowquality products another year personal rating single coop spiel super es macht echt mit den die gegend zu erkunden aber irgendwann ist es echt nur noch langweilig man sieht immer die gleiche gegend muss ein bis zweit magazine den kopf eines soldaten bis dieser endlich und bei mancher mission muss man echt lange suchen und das der gegend die man eh schon nicht mehr sehen kannschade das da schnell die luft raus ist games great start really fun explore area girls point really boring always see area shoot one two magazines head soldier finally falls missions search really long time area cant see moretoo badthat air fast buy sale worth full price love wolfenstein seriesgiving positive review fun playing short game enjoyed action added coop theme melee weapons still op read tip belowhowever level scaled enemies type ammo defeat even dying shotgun face unlimited
