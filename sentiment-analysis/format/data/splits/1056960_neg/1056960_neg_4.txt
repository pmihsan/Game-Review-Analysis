upset two cheery naive protagonists changes tone game gritty war thriller slightly lighthearted survival tale rpg elements upset people personally new heroines arent infamous bj blazkcowicz things learn arent badass day far gun play ive found enticing implementing hard soft armored opponents something requires bit strategy disappointed optional micro transactions luckily cosmetic reasons something gaming community never seem escape nowadays overall enjoying title pick sale cause game good fps rpg necessarily fact wolfenstein played hour found boring ask refunda game worthless investment cant hold players long enoughno way title match ancestor played whole game friend honestly game sucks enemy absolute bullet sponges sometimes would venture area enemy right levelled easily one shot boss battles cool little present challenge except absolute bullet sponge ending disappointing compared past wolfenstein games twin sisters absolutely cringy af elevator scenes purchased game spite lot negative reviews thought would give try anyway hr download could start game without opening mandatory acct bethesda refused option dump game say solong money known forced pathetic marketing scheme never would bought dont like type thing forced throat ran game resolution options aa maxed ti played xbox one controllerpros game ran well minor stuttering framerate drops experienced zero crashes control issues kind weapon upgrade system solidcons way way many collectables reason exist serves slow game wolfenstein game meant slow stealth nearly completely worthless found go gunsblazing dual armour type system enemies deeply painfully annoying game hampered large open world constantly respawns enemies making game agonizing slog characters worst ive experienced year astoundingly annoying brutally stupid repetitive speak like drunk frat boys hated way even loading screen cutscenes force sit antics two blithering dolts slow load times constant slow interarea transitions quest direction bad idea go many quests open world also direct areas high level without telling completely worthless microtransactions shoehorned reason took something amazing wolf series essentially destroyed nearly every directorial decision could made made wrong one feel angrier every time play game vile many levels really tried love game bought franchise since new order return castle wolfenstein one cannot bough anymore others im true fan franchise really wanted play girlfriend loved new order new colossus love twins strong female characters represent coop fundamental design important aspect dont like game designed ground slowdown game maximize time player spend within world whatever tedious way exists doesnt seem bad isnt well worst cannot save checkpoints except one per main mission top means play restarted beginning get climax final battle yeah thats fun particular get really difficult battles happened restart level dont restart previous save return basically state died probably without ammo shared lives etc deal enemies nothing killing giant robot pistol check yeah way kill giant robot pistol even full ammo yeah hitting right placesbut also details break box get loot axe takes like hits different parts box meaningless collectibles everwhere stop playing search every little corner every damn collectible worst side actions appear level mayor battle go different part map meaningless chore return back find mayor battle enemies respawned low ammo without save repeat yet remember dont dare story hint story nothing compare beautiful complex story new

althistorical world awesome shooting negative ai partner although competent makes boss fights difficult great mindless fun see people dislike game still blood pumping nazi killing fun thankfully able refund game get something better hard imagine bethesda brought us dishonored morrowind doom skyrim oblivion etc whole new approach games make depressing sign elder scrolls vi likely going similar microtransactions youngblood dont buy ever unsalvagable current state would better drinking bleach think wolfenstein universe continues develop direction end even dont consider technical realization bad communication sisters action plot franchises exploitation nothing else practice absolute trash thought bad could played play wolfensteins tried play immediately playing new order old blood new colossus honestly nothing like movement seems sluggish level system makes dealing enemies minutes fairly harder enemies start explanation given start create character anything actually choose weapons abilities graphics manage worse new colossus everything set max dlss reason removed gore even game may bad everyone says wolfenstein game wolfenstein skin pasted iti may try play future wouldnt recommend buying even bundle cheaper buying games seperately current rating playable friend would obviously contribute lot game playing solo may enjoy time truly enjoyed previous installments franchise however cannot recommend doesnt feel like wolfenstein socalled nonlinear gameplay nothing else grind grind grind level character maps regular grunts health adjusts level making enemies suddenly soak magazine magazine spend time kite around finally drop boss fights lot kiting graphics sound ok nothing remember common story far hours already spent ever invested sad given history

ive preordered ill remove library wolfenstein wanted play bloody mess hipster bullshit im sure game getting many negative reviews visually gorgeous satisfying hard incredibly rewarding use every mechanic possible outsmart group enemies cheesy full slang dark gory fights combat sooo smoothmaybe people expected something serious maybe cheesiness lost people wolfenstein never meant serious game atmosphere reminds stranger thingsi wouldnt play game damn much fun buddy complements playstyle im sorry really dont know unbalanced piece crud supposed guess ai ok meant enemies swedish nazis werent stupid also guess map design ok meant maps resemble annoying labyrinths wolfenstein guess boils purpose purpose game developers didnt know game trying make theres reason players understand playing eitherin guessing one thing certain ill play game thru even dumb messy im grinding achievement hunter looking coop games reason playing ive finally beat main story one best gaming experiences ive long time shame game getting many negative reviews one best games ive played long time flaws like microtransactions rpg elements mediocre bosses bad partner ai would consider goty material graphics stunning plot brilliantly written edge seat pricetag steal especially compared previous games actual side quests time unlike pathetic ones last games characters great shame game came antibethesda outrage even though didnt much input direction would rate game dont listen haters completely wrong call game bad even mediocre great game least give chanceps fuck give negative review technical problems aside glitches everyone ive played friend kept stepping front shots enjoyed feel different typical wolfenstein game much feel empty times design decent definitely dont mind money spent micro transaction seem bit well rubs wrong way least isnt play win ive really enjoyed previous wolfenstein reboot games really feel dropped ball one gameplay extremely repetitive guns feel wrong didnt expect enemy healthbars little alert signs new bullet type system really slows gameplay maps hard navigate lot time spent trying find objective going way back previous objective see need go back whole game screams microtransactions boosters skins ingame currencies hope doesnt carry next game im mad disappointed ive tried really hard play game cant even consider game cause real games let play havent tried one friends cant even play game stranger cause either bugs immediately get kicked friend buys game start questioning youre friends person want spend hours killing nazis bunch really big guns game triggers common politically ignorant male perpetual state arrested development pushing youre something right first wolfenstein game youll enjoy plenty people complain rpg elements doesnt bother im new series rock paper scissors armor system get tedious reach mid game really doesnt matter strumgewer sniper attachments absolute best part game literally ruined friends experience stealing kills calling loser dont recommend game friends otherwise fan wolfenstein series dont buy disappoint much potential next game new colossus yet came thislame story pointless side missionsthat armor thing enemies use specific weapon type made combat fun frustrating short story well finished less hours average playerlast least cringe dialogues sisters almost time made wonder game actually series wolfenstein new order come expecting something like previous wolfenstein games like severely disappointed expected typical run gun shooter feel powerful halfway decent story telling got bullet sponge enemies semiboring side missions breaking main campaign incredibly irritating protagoniststhe tackedon rpg mechanics need go plain simple dont want level character guns want good single player campaign experience addition god ai partner frustrating limited number lives wouldnt normally problem dumbass ai partner didnt steal upon dying mention theyll occasionally bug ignore reviving youas side note nvidia offers game rtx card purchase case dont know doesnt support raytracing time writing launch day thanks lot machine games call duty already game developers nowdays nuts releasing copies game different textures applied worth time version game lost originality wolfenstain know played previous wolfenstein game great game however assume people buying game played previous game major flaws compared previous games rebooted region map minimap makes locating mission objectives finding commanders finding collectables knowing good paths attack extremely difficult impossible easy mode extremely difficult longer oneshot headshot enemies stealthtype playthrough stealth table enemies take extremely long kill example takes shots bfg kill render distance max still makes horizons look extremely blurry crappy seems like major oversight since major storypoints game towers look large region map upgrades new weapon customization make significant differance weapon seems like fluff real enemies respawn entirely quickly example leave region map half city block step another region directly adjacent go directly back everyone spawned back note need take step new region old region respawn incredibly annoying since many region seen windows doors enemies alert position even different regiontldr minimap useless single path instead openworld stealth impossible
