actually need damage sponge enemies need grind gun attachments game joke man even mmo shooter sorts game run gun fun avoid game possible totally worth anyones time game bad might actually killed franchise would damn shame would love proper sequel wolfenstein sequel actually builds expands shooting mechanics introduced new order new colossus instead throwing away create really bad generic looter shooter loot game though dont really know call abomination really basic leveling upgrading system put core idea made game grind get many bullet sponged enemies thrown end fighting highly armoured robot enemies take long take humanoid nazis absolutely nothing made fan previous games impact weight gunfights gone everyone robot level design awful poorly designed makes backtrack areas everything looks bland style game really sad look story horrendous two unlikable protagonists ive ever displeasure playing seriously believe two characters destroyed series show hypothetical wolfenstein going bring game even though previous games top still sense believability mainly writing characters buy bj unstoppable nazi killing machine invested journey twin daughters dont buy second things game slaughter thousands nazis dont take anything seriously process first kill start game experience prior game throws away believablilty world banter two sisters cringe think twitched eye one point rare story minimal poorly written dialogue really bad well voice acting horrible french accents still bunch games play came safe say worst game ive played released awful game soulless characters unlikable bethesda proved quality died fallout optimistic elder scrolls vi game worst love wolfenstein franchise game honestly doesnt seem part itthere rich story characters super flat cartoonish even npcs resistance opposite npcs new colossus examplebesides fun play stupid illusion making play time spend hours getting back beginning mission die ammo checkpoints middle missions gonna kill giant robot pistole ammo even hitting weak places effective guess die nvidia rtx even gpu game continuously crash video memory leaks make gpu load go start see lot lag get message telling restart game cannot continue playing remember checkpoints guess yeah go back beginning mission kill giant robot ing pistoletldr story flat characters checkpoints video memory leaks etc extremely disappointed game trashpoor character poor story endless boring missiondont buywaste money waste time game needs bug fixes got stuck general winkler could hear voice wasnt roomcan someone release mod turns dialog removes female protagonist least pretend game overrun feminist trash game thinks coop get away difficult kill bullet soaking ai mess random repetitive missions least favorite wolfenstein game far game terrible step wrong direction got wolfenstein series pretty late starting new colossus great single player campaign badass nazi killing action played old blood might liked even heard thought id give benefit doubt try piece garbage game need multiplayer constantly even ai companion still annoying everything level locked based level system instead youre older games played dont buy game doesnt play feel anything like ones giant turd fuck bethesda game absolute shit ashamed putting cringefest game characters immediately annoying could actually find someone else play gameplay worse first wolfenstein games ie new order old blood dont waste time game disappointing tno tob tnc great games game bad compared added many rpg elements added microtransactions removed dual wielding guns mechanic made combat games greatim really disappointed game horribly disappointing first wolfenstein game bad borderlands clone secondly narratively makes sense teenagers magically know fight cause parents get weapons fly enemy territory finally feel like bad ass game wolfenstein bad ass even underpowered still feel strong wear power armor start ton weapons abilities somehow feel lame wolfenstein paris seems like good idea wolfenstein themed also cool everything else poorly executed waste time disappointing game franchise play games story gameplay means end pitted excessively strong opponents insanely tough bosses lack resources save options download cheat mod able progresswill another wolfenstein release probablywill buy probably certainly see reviews bad imagine playing wolfenstein levels every mission meaning keep replaying levels entire time mission fun wolfenstein game bad copy destiny enemy levels heads youre weak youll dead seconds trailers show false advertising good game get sale nitpick story elements killed many nazi soldiers early quests shouldnt left paris characters abby cliche deus ex machina super hacker instantly access information ever need without sisters would chance parts day long end day game nazikilling power fantasy quite wellpros gameplay fun weapon customization much depth previous title play singleplayer wantcons dialogue cringy isnt lot variety gets annoying quickly sisters call dude every line swearing gets gratuitous final boss fight neither fun fairhes damage sponge defeat multiple times lot happened new colossus young blood barely mentioned give examples bj killed hitler shortly last game basically entire world except europe driven nazis united states recreated essentially somehow grace walker head fbiits like every writing teacher says show dont tell basically wolfenstein ii less interesting characters boring storyline exact copypaste iis combat first wolfenstein im blast despite bad rpg mechanics noticed enemies almost immune one bullet type know bullet type weak indicator head probably beside health bar small clear feels almost useless heat combat time figure bullet type weak already bullets even using correct weapon time kill still long top bs armor others shoot monday get killed wednesday one thing note playing normal difficulty imagine playing higher difficulty issues way enough make game bad overall least personally good things game still outweighs issues really love fluidity movement like mixed doom apex legends think add custom difficulty settings like dishonored customize every little detail makes entire difficulty help fix issues mention wolfenstein dont get game bad game like destiny wolfenstein single player game save point went back beginning tried game instructions terrible nothing settings tell anything got stuck first section power jump couldnt figure refunded one wolfenstein game finishing first really enjoy game hours grind really started set realization still lot slog im fan devs action enjoyable long ai behaves handle weapons affect enemies reusing zones respawning nazis midmission odd decision killer game zero objectives im sure game broken im missing something obvious load zone main objectives ive tried zones im frustrated broken poor vectoring opinion sadly stay away game one games shows need options thumbs forced choose go even though im playing game probably finish itreasons coop adds absolutely nothing wolfenstein franchise game designers nothing different singleplayer games maybe areas little bit larger usual also means theyre less detailed usual sister played real person dumb brick healtharmor inflated plus heal full randomly maybe hit awhileout combat dunno infinite cloak youre trying hide compensate fact stand fire dont pick anything idiotic stealthing ive seen bump enemies walking around cloak dont worry enemy kind shrugs goes must rat something also sister crap actually killing anything youll end heavy lifting anyways still keep alive large fights feel like youre babysitting retarded kid nerf gun strapped face enemies bullet sponges pretty obvious levelingarmor system make challenge fighting two players somehow doubt really works even becomes old enemies longer fun forced weapon swapping isnt fun even proper weapon enemies take ten times long kill single player useless sister twice bad since work whee manual saving even single player fuck thats well coding two separate save systems gosh darn hard autosaves coop god also pausing reason stupid since coop games type often still pause gamers bladders phones doorbells plot okay aside sisters new characters introduced best annoying hacker girl daughter one annoying characters previous game naturally appropriately charge yet another live service idiocy challenge board hey today want jump times coinsthis content yeah brings us live services crap challenge board could easily turned random missions given reallife time limits make sense kind game obviously set copy ubisoft model dailyweekly challenges exception able earn store currency microtransactions dumb pointless useless overpriced skins boosters political commentary almost nonexistent youre going clever guess fine little trying insulting though even trying humorous clever unlike previous games effort put guess define lazy seems appropriate bland im even sure nazis would offended bugs serious one audio decides lose shit restart game nothing horrible thoughnow said youre one crazy people actually bought game play coop intend play coop list shorter suppose could recommend case conversely like wolfenstein games dont intend playing coop solidly say go spend money elsewhere wolfenstein title amazing part old games fact always another way act guns blazing nothing bad wifi relied single player experience dont someone play game playable stealth biggest sin dogshit story pissed great game ok game followed bad game explains vr title terrible idk care much love first wolfenstein game mechine games much see final installment lost everything made good disappear truly makes depressed fuck todd howard smell little fallout destroying ass game really disappointment expected nothing proper sequel new colossus im afraid theyve made step forward wrong direction way worse previous installments every way combat interactions twins awkward guns weak hard use headshots hard perform cannot kill even weakest enemy one shot one important elements story badly ruined way unfolds npcs empty simple dialogues could go havent finished game ive exhausted everything thats driving play arkane satisfactory job prey also brought flaws one bad game many levels enemys bullet sponges respawn youll find avoiding killing nazis nazi killing game bot sucks youre forced play multiplayer multiplayer sucks step games series really disappointing bad considering come years later compared others sponge enemies lots unavoidable shots random disconnects voice buggy
