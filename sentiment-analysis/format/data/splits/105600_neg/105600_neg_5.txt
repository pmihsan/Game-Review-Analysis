jobs recommend nuthin wrong jogo muito interessante tenho um pouco mais de horas jogadas zerei jogo de inumeras maneiras mas sempre bacana jogar com os amigoso jogo uma mecanica e jogabilidade interessante em sua trouxe alguns problemas com lag principalmente para computadores mais fracos tem seus momentos mas chatos como na parte de e farm que maioria pessoal se rende e fica meio entendiado nos modos mais faceis tem uma consideravel tempo de farm pois os boss precisam de tanto recurso para serem vencidos nos modos mais dificeis ter set completo e muito bem montado faz muita suas batalhas interessantes uma significativa de eventos e um um tanto quanto dificil te uma boa passar algumas horas minerando pescandosim ajuda muito pescar e farmando os monstros e depois derrotar um boss bem mais jogo tem seu esquema deupgrade pode juntar itens para fazer itens melhores pode combinar armaduras e armas para deixar seu personagem ainda mais forte e geral um jogo muito interessante e que com certeza vai te trazer muitas horas de felicidade e raiva primeiro jogo que fez iniciar um cotidiano gamer pc realmente recomendo um jogo incrivel terraria crashar meu computador

minecraft first hours game takes gameplay alot adding tons rpg elements mainly equiptment allowing combat evolve simply spaming swordbow whatver flying around dodgeing enemies projectiles giant monsters underground simutaneosly dealing sufficient amount damage far challengeing minecraft could ever alot rewarding would suggest game heart beat oh replay value suprisingly high something expected game people go mostly fangay say anything game boring boring play alone general mechanics like minecraft harvest day hide night arent ready take monsters rinse repeat adinfinitum get stronger use mod boost get go raid put killing bosses loot said boring playing minecraft alone unless using minecraft hand build worlds statues whatnot cant really people problems game dissapearingjust dont
