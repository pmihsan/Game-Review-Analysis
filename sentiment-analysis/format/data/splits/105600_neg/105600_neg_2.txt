werkzeuge und viele gegner bosse und errungenschaften damit einen nie langweilig wird viele kleinigkeiten zum beispiel der musik und sounds jedes biom und vieles mehr eine sache mich jedoch seit den update terraria und steam nach einer zeit ab und das wird von mal zu mal immer das bezieht sich darauf dass die welt bei den letzten speicherpunkt wieder und die gesammelten items weg sind zum beispiel man bei der sonnenfinsternis man die ganze zeit und bekommt das zerbrochende schwert und dann terraria ab es ist richtig deprimierend hoffentlich kommt ein patch aber sonst richtig cooles spiel game cool many weapons armor tools course many enemies bosses achievements one never get bored many nice little things example smooth transition music sounds every biom much one thing however bothers since update terraria steam staggered time time time often refers fact world loaded last memory point collected items gone example one solar eclipse fight time get broken sword crashes

juegoregedit lo venderia por un poquito mas considero que esta muy barato en steam esa es mi opinion de terraria para steam espero por ese espero ablo por todos ojala que regedit siga sacando actualizaciones que superen las anteriores espero que entiendan mi opinion xddd un poco larga este juego bastante bien porque tiene muchas cosas que hacer es un minecraft en pero con mucha variedad de enemigos minerales armas puedes jugar con cualquier ordenador por sus lo malo es que te explica nada sobre el juego tienes que aprenderlo tu solo algunas veces te sientes perdido con tantos objetos pero es muy barato tiene casi bugs lo recomiendo el culo de alvaro eta igra zastavlyayet menya khotet umeret vse v poryadke ete guego e ahin loco de etratejia n berda penza muxo aunk lo presca simple

gotta start really worth purchase game getting chased aliens zombies pirates running unicorn machine gun made would play againhowever need friends adventure quite lonely boring without friends friends game makes game finest every bad game design decision think one game every months come back game remind exploration game dig tunnel hell every months come back game friends play new characters couple weeks get best gear kill bosses goes back shelf im upset ive logged around hours time review im sure two three months ill started another character every single change addition implemented final update serves make game less enjoyable lets start entirely worthless master mode change made expert mode stats enemies bosses even inflated developers made effort make even single encounter legitimately difficult opting instead increase damage dealt everything point single dart trap instantly kill enemies dealt whichever pathetic manner think since fighting head get killed real difficulty enemies addition massively inflated health pools damage absurdly high knockback resistance comes bosses expert mode implemented new ai patterns make battles challenging master mode increase already inflated stat pool even gives tangible reward subjecting battles prior higher damage leads directly next point reward never actually incentivised play difficulty additional drops boss added pool trophies pets occasional mount addition enemy drop rates identical expert mode equivalents meaning farming essential items like rod discord painful expert mode perhaps even painful due inflated stats every single enemy game thing could called incentive single additional accessory slot necessity almost every boss tedious excuse difficulty even expert mode added accessory slot implemented addition adding exclusive useful drop every single boss gamejourney mode useless entirety likely reason added many features noticed many people using similar features exploits vanilla modded playthroughs removal several duplication exploits would obviously annoy countless players lets placate watered version exploits locked behind character type gives reason actually play game save individual player defined constraints using godmode dangle front facethe additional npcs serve less purpose golf perhaps single boring sport could ever decided implement bloated abomination used call game existance furry npc degenerate admission developers degenerate scummany additions game seem serve real gameplay purpose exist like addition luck completely hidden stat raised lowered arbitrary means npc happiness serves punish player dont house npcs way developers want tothe one saving grace mods brought public eye tmodloader officially distributed steam small consolation though given anyone functioning brain cells rub together could install tmodloader ease past choosehad developers taken route many popular content mods actually added form real challenge master mode outside mere stat boosts incentive play master mode outside cosmetic garbage single accessory slot maybe would accept content level effort put stands almost additions made terraria either tedious arbitrary simply unenjoyable every single time traveling merchant came villagenpc homes would drown put water used kill pit cover pit dirt place tombstone top dirt carving name unfortunate traveler decided stop specific village onto would drown everyone every six months find getting tired game every time terraria draws back another hours bliss extraordinary game one final update way free wont regret jumping
