game killing wall flesh items dropped stone box problem hardmode starts got killed ultra strong skeleton caverns many extreme mobs defeat think killing wall flesh nothing making game harder love game however rather large problemthe obvious enemy design particularly hardmode enemies simple patterns slimes jump zombies walk towards etc etc however enemies move walls wouldnt problem also nasty tendency come underneath floors cant attack problem especially hardmode enemies quite bit damage making deaths enemies feel somewhat cheap bosses problem occasionally hangaing underground cant attackedbut combat general fun quite satisfying movement responsive game isnt hard normalin words play pretty good bucks love game hours record atmbut much play time got bored trouble playing game maybe multiplayer would funi played game hallow mode never able beat first boss yeah wasnt good also stopped playing whileproseverythinnnnggconsafter hours may get boringcaused less life love game damn epic love game really gets small penis pumping blood fight boss ejaculate spurts desk kill moonlord love game little boring start momentum starts building enter hard mode game amazing may frustrating glitches definitely worth buy love game however find original grind making sure character die existing surface annoying hard time really getting mid end game stuff want start scratch id say intend one world use different class playthroughs whatnot love game theres many content pretty good replayability bosses npcs building start well first npcs would expect stores personalities npc specific way must unlock killing boss getting far game even finding spelunking even unlock gentlepeople must viable room one wouldnt want poor innocent souls lounging around outside would build house several sepperate houses make whatever want like huge glowing mushroom secret base mountain limit imagination favorite thing creating minecart tracks travel quickly different parts map ive built different things like example boss fighting arena probably invest time building helps bosses think bosses rather enemies balanced first time encounter enemies youll hard time fighting even zombies floating eyes late game youll cutting fun go hard mode really start enjoying game thing bad untill kill wall flesh new enemies ways dont worry get better weapons whether killing bosses creating youll start adapt alot weapons magic thought id put therefor exploration pretty good floating islands secret underground jungle temples fair share things kill killing alot moment get first several types wings funnest thing ever think overall amazing game completely worth ask mostly get friends like said earlier great replay value see stupid challenges speedrunning bosses overall fish lava sayin love game game make frown turn upside game gory aspects kill enemy thats game detailed diverse run low end computer console love game think defeated wall flesh nope go hardmode collect ores fight weirder monsters go expert mode get better loot etc anyways non stopping tons hours hours dont even everything ive defeated moon lord havent farmed weapons yet eventually farming get bored start wont old boring thing speed runs building challeges seriously worth money priced actual value itd easy get many hours game love game many bosses enemies itemsi suck building though ngl xd love first time got

would suggest playing friends also enjoyable alone mods add much replayablity would suggest friends play withthis game playde alongside friends time lifebut alone bit boring bad bit boringalso tip new player exminecraft player playing mediumcore maybe since good game make silly mistakes die suck fall damage etc experience dar playing normally dying dying multiple times try recover inventory would underestimate game called anything masterpiecethe replayability really makes game amazing classes fact every class many different weapons accessories armorsets makes much fun top game doesnt limit single class fucking mix ends loop coming back game thats without mods start downloading mods possibilites basically endless doesnt stop everplaying game normalmode get glimpse youre experience expertmode example moonlord fight normal mode isnt hard easy either overall fair going expert mode really get body ready youre gonna getting oneshot fucking laserbeams eyeballs tries later finished
