slime balls umbrellas game fight multiple bosses collect multiple weapons build amazing structures go hell back game kill bunnies sword game spend hours digging virtual dirt addictiveget game waste time game particularly excel anything besides obnoxious waste timeforemost combat system unsatisfying shallow mess players awkwardly move around two dimensional space clicking enemies death struggling avoid damage limited mobility players enemies dont attack lazily designed deal damage touching player thus combat encounters involve player even reacting enemy attacks instead perpetually attempting keep away awkward computer enemies gravitating towards enemies bounce dig float jump around incoherently blatantly inconsistent patterns often far agile player every time player gets hurt get knocked around turning combat spastic mess enemies knocking player around player struggles click death even uncommon player get stunlocked completely overwhelmed enemies point functioning isnt even possible anymorethe game aggressively respawns enemies constantly point player often cannot even perform tasks area perform every four actual seconds player spends want spend least twenty seconds fighting enemies respawn system decides calm moment every structured task player perform area mind numbing chore bloated numerous time spent fending perpetual enemy spamthe game makes player perform lots chores besides every boss following basic trial error based attack pattern generally possible players fight bosses naturally players little mobility bosses like enemies much player must build entire arena fight boss players build multiple completely different places different biome locked bosses mentioned one player spends eighty percent time fighting enemies try even finished spawn boss outside extremely limited random encounters players need grind resources create item spawns bosses disappear player doesnt spawn night turns day fight often regular mobs even invade boss arena risk getting player killed messing combat pattern since mobs already already spawned wander fightsometimes players cant even fight boss game wont stop spawning enemies nearby player never clear boss arena begin fight without combat pattern interrupted single mob sometimes enemies shoot projectiles player screen sometimes enemies teleport player immediately damage sometimes enemies fall screen land player instantly enemies camp inside physical objects impossible player hit bosses spawn projectiles move faster player possible purposely avoid since player movement game atrocious absolutely balancing conscious effort put making combat remotely fair enjoyable lazy simply coded extremely recycled clicker gameplayplayers trade absurd amount different merchant characters player individually build house order gain access thus yet player must perform pointless chores find nowhere games build dozen houses basic access merchants even chores allowed features games give player default without wasting timethe effectiveness player massively influenced gear modifiers players find craft items assigned modifier make better worse average order measure later game enemies early game enemies playing higher difficulty players reroll gear modifiers get optimal ones random chance diceroll players go individual pieces equipment costs lot players grind money gamble right able survive higher tier content players grind get rare random boss drops grind get rare random enemy drops perhaps spend another chunk time holding cursor button mindlessly dig earth search random loot somewhere blank expanses dirt rock randomly dying instant kill traps barely visibleplaying lowest effortless difficulty setting generally advisable due ineptly game designed combat coherent mow enemies instantly especially infinitely respawning youre trying finish building boss arena bosses poorly designed need build entire zone somewhat playable fight rigid trial error patterns single random enemy interrupts dance die grind money sink colossal amounts currency gambling get decent modifiers equipment even surviveatrocious nearly every functional aspect obviously atrocious many hoops players jump make game remotely playable versus games playable start building multiple arenas fight bosses building numerous houses trade merchants gambling get useful equipment digging dirt hours get resources ludicrous
