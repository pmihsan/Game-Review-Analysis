thing two software cant figure year old game used play pocket pcalso cant get work properly fullscreenim going recommend favorite game time get shit together fucks sakeedit performance issues mostly fixed campaigns excelent still play classic mode youre masochist two thumbs love rework graphics classic game major glaring issue units sometimes get stuck groups cant move unless mess bit get unlocked doesnt make game unplayable bit annoying times dont know ppl complaining bugs pathfinding sucks else maybe purchased latest update already come dont encounter errors far childhood memories revisited play game cousin back windows remaster bgm almost break tears maybe change desktop icon match aoeror icon back day perfection dont know bought game steam already windows store toothe pathfinding incredibly bad really ruins game armies run combat way long armies split apparent reason make lose fights ai micros every movementim late ask refund would dont remember game bad path finding joke constantly babysit every unit wander trying gather units form attack frustrating units wont clump together size seems bigger visual graphics game try keep formation units standing select gets really annoying units constantly trying chase something attack pointless drop trying gather youll unit time dont know everyone complaining crashes stuff zero problems game problem fact phalanx stupidly op ai landed island obliterated army legion troops without loosing single man continued tracking villagers like knew without scouting still fun problem running game get firewall warning cancel got warnings cant remember one cancel bothand make sure isnt pc software isnt updated even think isplayed hours straight still fun remember playing first time years agothis actually first game played pc ever love age empires games ive played still play new definitive edition terrible optimisation reason one bothered play reskin terribly implemented enhanced graphics improvements fps drops drastically zoom villagers broken pathing sometimes wait instead trying collect resources different sides animal example although would ignore every bug game could run without fps problems cannot see many others high end pcs cannot play properly stable fps amateur devs loved alot game wait game full bugs doesnt receive title game abomination gorgeous love art gamebreaking unplayable unit movement made lose entire army got blocked ragequit game villagers also block gathering shit get stuck gathering food really bad also u select seperate units one box move somewhere doesnt clump move formation selected big loved entire aoe series felt nostalgic thought id give try omg could worse others terrible pathfinding bad characters get stuck treeline waterline sounds terrible refund less minutes play loved original game one buggy pieces get locked together cant move dont follow commands wander opposite directions constantly like herding sheep several flaws logic narrator voice phony english accent annoying worst thing babylon opening scenario playable standard mode oddly play hardest reason start lone priest need convert villagers weakest neighbour already village several villagers second convert first one others converge kill priest follow hes dead must start lone villager stone age neighbours quickly progress iron age matter create abase attack even make enough villagers get resources hardest mode villagers dont attack priest strange played first campaign easiest setting still lost horribly game way hard im competent video gamer played hell game decades ago theyve updated graphics significantly great replay value evn years later played game windows store released kinda horrible bugs features original game like bad pathfinding things like ranking patched age empires always wanted think game looks worse original units looks like style wallace gromit clearer graphics see every unit clone eachother looks exactly ruins realism think game unfinished yet animations really poor etc tried really hard enjoy game cannot recommend get downgrade every single aspect imaginable firstly ai dogshit amount times ur vills afk get stuck rock tile astounding secondly lack commands units results heap frustration enemy boats units seeping thru ur defences cos u cant patrol ur army protect anything quite annoying also hate enemy ai like sort tunnel vision maphacks constant swarms enemy units seemingly homing missles ur villagers matter map really slows progress ur vills constantly getting massacred game slow lack end game upgrades makes taking enemy bases bit tedious play max speed campaign missions still mostly take hour beat u usually end slowly advance towers enough soldiers protect siege units stop going suicide towers protect cav charges reset whole process successful noticed going navy seems best thing almost always costs wood boat armies water supremacy saves constant transport raids killing ur vills boats anniliating ur eco yeah icing cake forced hand negative review frustrating campaign mission taking hour complete rise rome lvl finally assaulting enemy base random defeated shows enemy army eco left clue sure pissed enough finally admit game worth time get let nostalgia memories keep afloat instead playing soiling fond memories hey pretty thats disappointed game maybe thats misalignment expectations developers id done research game burst nostalgia saw gamedevelopers may faultgraphically beautiful game great able launch without worry compatibility issues feels like game whilst understand sticking original mechanics gates obvious one units stupid back original release painful dont want waste time watching trio axemen wander circle whilst getting shot pieces fourth friend two pixels far one side confusing tiny brain say youre looking experience original aoe feel game great im left feeling disappointed say lack original sound files frustrating even option switch also frustrating large amount crashing multiplayer extremely frustrating game breaking error wish mixed option review seeing cannot recommend game recommend proshigh resolution graphicsnice update original game animations visuals generalcombines everything aoe aoe ror single gamefor looking old feeling playing original game feel itconsso many things could improved make much much less irritating troop formation troops wander bump continuously making almost impossible control perform effective attack defence hard control units imagine whole army select one one order move wish pathfinding sux troops villagers get stuck time dont pay attention might find minutes later villager sent build watch tower stuck forest along combine absence troop formation becomes impossible painful use strategy game relies mostly using strategy priests range yet reason wont start healing unless unit almost completely next sometimes units wounded close priest yet doesnt anything thing units like war galley wont start shooting enemy units sight matter position choose see enemy troops next villager constructing building stand without reaction another issue range war galleys range enemy tower less yet reason go figure boats need get towers range order shoot time shot whats purpose increased range put withing enemys towers population caps campaign supposed beat difficult ai constantly spams attacks rebuilds everything destroy villagers resources boats army units population
