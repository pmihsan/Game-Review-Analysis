become stuck move narrow spaces like bridges makes almost impossible command multiple units units stop randomly almost like forget basically original game ai cheats even harder spams even faster dont waste money beautifully remastered game barring fps drops first minute ever campaign level pantsonhead retarded unit pathing microsoft age empires mythology fan since early always found games fascinating got happy release definitive titles cant really recommend nowfirst made buy title instead aoe ii able play ancient cultures something games general lack saw chance like romans egpyt game offers lot limitations compared games much better graphics much better interface tons empires tons troops upgrades soundtrack lot troops getting stuck multiple times unable move limit confusing upgrades example upgrade towers cellar wut upgrade troops warehouse makes feel lost times able kill unecessary troopspeasants tons useless buildings cutscenes gates complete castle sure original one voice acting heroes dumb ai free matches ai decide attack timei expect updates game still masterpiece stay away buy aoe ii instead able get steam godsend game desperate need bugfixes pieces ability switch original graphics much appreciated best way play like godcreate build destroy better original aoe still bad game buggy funits get constantly stuck random spotsai dumb bricketc etc overall game could used new graphicslike fixes updatesconclusion playablebut enjoyable patches bugs shift doesnt work sequential building instead build last click fifo starts last click filo characters get stuck one none move characters dont formation keep position selected difficults unbalanced easy hard didnt even try standardothers version aoe aom features decades ago outdated campaign ai broken cheats knows scouting worker rushes base name couldnt even botherfed fix original really annoying worker path finding problems block waste money cant play online multiplayer cant play lan games need online play lan tried get refund denied thats im giving negative review game lags cant even play friends cant go wrong age empires classic instantly recognisable tried tested fun cant go wrong wit basics done well comparing dont feel enough changed much original places barely recognisable aspects mechanics first scrapped replaced dumbed approachvery disappointing considering remaster done well considering good work done age empires de expecting similar work game unfortunately ai enemy still old issues plays ineffective even hard little experience playing game realize ai critical flaws game war units still op others still useless also expecting new civilizations new campaigns gaia diversity animals threes snow maps new maps types instead added oasis mapthe game pure nostalgic looks nice still plain many things nothing relevant improved constant crashes lag large scale battles even gaming machine problems persist dont see point upgrading graphics hd problems plagued original release still evidentfrom research issues thing quite game fix horizonsteam remove pile garbage store immediately cool strategy game takes minutes familiarise basics gameoverall good one small glitch sometimes people stuck build building expected could move even build building warriors also sometimes stuck even change directions much space move toother game recommended damn forgot back games actually required think result got destroyed times clearing first greek mission standardthe good graphic music actually challenging scenarios hard rts veteranthe bad formations units tend scatter place bad pathfinding priestcatapults tend change middle combat instead staying backthe game work buy find sale worth full price better try sequel decided buy steam since microsoft store completely retarded remaster aoe done fairly well main upgrade course graphics need upgrade aoe age well aoe game still plauged terrible pathfinding little bugs quality life upgrades make game bit tolerable game suited well online play campaigns ai matches enjoyable play favorite thing remaster unit design cavalry chariots legions etc especially war ships look really good didnt realise terrible game back day didnt like graphics gameplay campgain bad buy terrible customer service considering deleting steam altogether easy mode enemy attacks minutes gorillion elephants ok figured focus military next time economy raise mighty army archers hoplites cavalry siege weapons much immediately attack enemy beginning win gorillion army elephants extra armor appear nowhere obliterate basically unbeatable campaign mode cant even progress second level easy mode far difficult dont time patience passion waste many hours playing monotonous game appease devs epic game real time strategy better simpler total war yet still fun eu jogo age empires desde seu sempre tive um carinho muito grande pelo rise rome e quando tomei conhecimento remaster definitive edition tive em comprar minha surpresa foi que coisa que melhoraram em ao na minha foram som e de certa forma os que permitem uma maior burrice artificial das unidades assustadora importa se cavalos ou elefantes eles travam nada enroscam uns nos outros e se movem que delete pelo menos um deles diverti um pouco desde que comprei mas geral estou desmotivando muito rapidamente e com vontade de reinstalar de even easy mode game tough players addition fact review section doesnt even spellcheck makes even pathetic even easy ai rushes sides within minutes getting iron age giant sized map players every single game get flooded enemy players even last last place scorewise tried every difficulty one plays exactly literally difference easy hardest bodes true campaign custom maps absolutely ridiculous problem since release single update addressed problem unplayable trash extremely disappointing fan aoe franchise since years old first let say graphics sound outstanding team great job brings back lot nostalgia unfortunately quickly ruined horrible ai pathing click group units go attacked clicked others wander attack something random ai tough even easy theyll work together take even theyre team manage get based youll find villagers standing around enemy units corners map anything maps little resources youll run gathering everything creating small army die stale mate cant finish game hopefully stuff gets fixed dd coming im doubtful save money hopefully dd better anyone wondering whether buy game wait months see bugs fixedthe crashes errors bad start game three times get five minutes needed write reviewand requires internet connection play left archaic drm past bad launches like kill game time fixed fans bought recall bad taste got launch everyone else wont careironic developer age empires game hasnt learned history fun path finding still problem game shit cannot play multiplayer servers working toster better perfomance servers game game poor compared aoe game slow also aoe much better maybe time give games game play ok ive spoiled aoe mythology im used upgraded mechanics game little hard going back ok absolutely must something chat system make text bigger go back check missed messages frustrating playing someone difficult communicate give game play painfully slow graphics nice theres lot wrong unit pathing awful point unit dies even hitting
