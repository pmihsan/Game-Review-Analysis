campaigns however multiplayer long dead buy want play friends old problem solved though pathfinding still problem comes better hope next patch add new civilizations unique units somehow worse original sat cd case shelf first map units getting stuck path finding seems worse ever units responding orders bit like ccedit memory bit hazy played c years im pretty sure priests would heal units next clicking heal rather walk half way round map first said unit doesnt move im also pretty sure units didnt randomly walk map attacking even defensive status set attacking enemy edit yet issues unit animations glitching mainly elephants best invisible priests wondering earth units firing priest suddenly appears dying animationedit ice skating priests moving across map without animationshame really stupid hard beat campains fun experience enjoyable time playing first age empires game definitive edition first game problems terms walls gates sequel games allow gates gate issue didnt encounter bugs slow lagi recommend anyone really enjoys first age empires game well wants get rts gene wish could say age empires definitive edition since already problems terms slow lag crashes try custom made games whole bunch problems hard defend problems say get first game age empires definitive edition first wait age empires definitive edition actually fixes problems terrible remasteri dont remember movement units bad think original game much fluid ai crazy stupid units often get stuck great game hours fun ai terrible cant even play campaign reason bought game always resign complete objectives ai pathfinding bad ais bit stubborn sometimes classic classic absolutely insufferable unit movement kills game buy enjoy babysitting stuck units game god awful pathfinding doesnt allow build gates instantly refunded get game wait aoe definitive edition instead game much fun sync error issues make virtually unplayable disappointment almost conquered several lans game times error end suddenly game unplayable buy without patch ai extremely aggressive easiest modes makes game impossible beat fun even max population army wasnt able beat one enemy first scenario easy buygoogle reviews game complaining difficulty settings game buggy multiplayer private lobby invitations dont work game nice nice graphics nice sounds musicbut controls game control dreadfulthe units bad pathfinder get stuck time others units environmentthe units always ignore commands attack walk enemy sighti dont recommend version game wall gate option bad game performance terrible old builds used run better pc whats going game worked well time since recent update friend get sync error multiplayer occurs anywhere minutes hour primary reason purchasing game play multiplayer frustrating error occur midway game games simply shuts seconds launch tried every thing bad graphics game play outstanding sometimes troops lack discipline like environment well nothing really bad game graphics music nice worst ai ive ever seen life roadmap soldiers drew move incredibly awful act go one end map graphics looks nice couple extra features like reseeding farms also nice game stuck past every annoying way able set behaviour newly made units etc also picked new issues units getting stuck upon lot previously bad thing game lack players reason play game curiosity horrible path finding boring campaigns civilizations pretty much much aoe pathfinding even broken original release smh pathfinding awful remembered thanks upgrading guysalso menu looks worse original game generallypoor glad ended great pity abou pathing game atrocious remember correctly much worse original version half time units go opposite clicking enough deem game unplayable broken theres glitch motion units get stuck encounter twice almost every game disappointing aoe fan theres genesis good game game age empires given ready availability much active player base better place go historic rts actionage empires worth time nostalgia value first rts ever played fond memories balance gameplay standards sequels civ plays similarly minor bonuses distinguish unique units techs real differences strategy mostly boils cosmetic variations strategy also lacking theres limit strong counter units trash units defences generally poor lack gates mean leaving walls open get units saving grace pathfinding terrible units often struggle get anyway course goes way though often youll find units getting killed half gotten lost trying walk around small rock also retain relative positions manually group get separated bad pathfinding thats mention units different move speeds seperate walking leaving likes priests siege units vulnerable shame couldnt adressed various formation functions couldnt added new edition youre remaking game add useful functions since proved games seriesthen course multiplayer games available many may difficult get game region get variable quality none matches played ranked could often get games crushed opponent crushed next game top lack early game defences like town center garrisoning means theres alot early game rushes deal several team games one player would villager rush knock another player entire team would fold issue due low numbers players teams discord several games played team matches find one member team fact group friends discord turned ally secure easy victory teams werent locked happen games like mention low numbers multiplayer make much worsehonestly ill end repeating said start go play age empires instead took amazing game ruined extremely poor unit mapping game inefficiently written major lag get anywhere near unit cap even bother trying put large group units together get stuck nothing sit middle battle killed game way back learned real time strategy original really hopping managed pull upgraded version usual ruin could great sad game bring back many memory still bad pathing problems however still recommend rts fans game bring back old day game still classic sadly new thing like campaign new civilization game still great game brings back feel nostalgicthe first rts ive ever played damn gooooodpros upgraded graphics looks amazing stuff really made well villagers walk farms bit smarter original units look awesome wololo multiplayer alivecons pathfinding units get stuck sacrifice one others move alone get really annoying especially preparing battle achievements get glitched points restart steam couple times get popped count progressioni rate game game make playing original less headache still original complete problems pathing fixed units randomly spawn buildings cant move ai terrible unless plan playing multiplayer games buy like original ai ffa work ends even easy impossible ally ai destroys ffa nondiplomatic games ai vs exists ai even stand attack despite forced enemies ai inconsistent hard ai ai never aged minutes others face moderate ai seems achieve villager lead minute mark making seem like ai cheating count resources rather follow script produce game pure nostalgia trip nothing didnt impove ai still one worst seen game besides minute rush offers nothing frequest crashes normal point game visually pleasing essential aspects needed addressed make game bearable play years path finding pathetic best units still
