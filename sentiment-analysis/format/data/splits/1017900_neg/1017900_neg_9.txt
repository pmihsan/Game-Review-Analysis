formations theyre blinding walking around like morons even though together unit dont understand developers lazy couldnt implement feature playing trying come back abysmal waste money game worthless aside graphically enhancing nothing fixed many things made worse neither campaign standard game hardest difficulty enemy either rushing instantly building towers next village centre defeating war elephants defense play setting hardest difficulty standard game campaign unwinnable even lowest setting game easy enemy sits play someone whos afk game utterly broken difficulty scaling either win enemy inactive absolutely curbstomps youfurthermore game bugged units frequently run get stuck moving take roundabout path straight path freely availablethe game utterly unplayable would demand refund possible buy something obviously tested game keeps crashing new update really annoying game still rules played first released odd yrs ago im playing youngster get rts started beautiful remaster original aoe damn bad understand staying true origins idea make modern beautiful didexcept one major flaw modernize important parts adding advanced commands like formation movements etc worst part path finding simply terrible units get stuck trying push buildings way soldiers get stuck damned tree unable move anywhere manually moved around stupid tree would send army attackmove command enemy base move stand perfectly still completely ignoring enemy units buildings would fight someone attacked directly units directly attacking units move come aid unless manually aggressive stance help allit beautiful remake original aoe damn terrible play buy full price hurt less realize little time spent optimizing important parts strategy game actually moving units attacking others ready micromanage every single damned unit since get stuck trees buildings units etc also time forgetting fight enemies classic game issue going back playing years later different game fast paced idea whats going yet nuts horrendously optimised buggy remaster looks decent runs poorly high end systems cant run consistently computer ram gtx lot bugs units glitching getting stuck music stopping playing single track countless complaints games performance forums developers havent done much address also havent bothered improve anything original example primitive unit grouping ai still bad used buy unfinished garbage easily one favorite games childhood quite possibly defining part life first rts ever played courtesy grandmother got package deal new laptop time dumped many hours years im older actually know hell im makes even fun game started became pc gamer many years ago game ever played game grandfather pc gaming personal opinion many people try compare game modern releases get upset much missing point rerelease pure nostalgia want part pc gaming history play game difficult therefore frustrating unbeatable game hours wasted useless heap shit go fuck unfortunately old unitgame defaults still active units automatically attack buildings units even aggressive stance turned game intuitive aoe ii would thought graphics redone text would little bigger clearer menu would simple shortcuts game selection navigation exist later models missed opportunity make game playable example build market building farms upgrade walls building granary smooth enjoyable play aoe ii unit movement incredibly buggy units take extremely long route destination shorter routes momentarily blocked eg another friendly unit passing narrow passageway units often refuse get transport boats even standing right next worst units sometimes get stuck together map meaning neither unit move spot makes game incredibly frustrating play units get stuck lot especially military units get stuck friendly military units spamming rightclick opposite directions sometimes unstucks way often kill free others bug destroys game experience significantly pathfinding general really bugged sometimes units run huge detours get point next without obstacles way spamming rightclick seems fix time really annoying units keep getting stuck map sometimes end attacking army reach target unplayable player really slight graphics update original game tracking errors annoying lack features would recommend unpolished game many bugs units constantly getting stuck example ai feels dumber original sad see lack care ruin couldve possibly great remake unstable keeps crushing without error report visuals indeed lot better however gameplay still badnot changedthe way units never group together moving somewhere units stuck behind treerock reasonyour catapults killing armyi would say worth money unable create lobby due server overload someone using one server u r using welcome bug empires seriously im fan aoe version lot different units stucking trying attack enemy stuck gathering building catapults always killing troops cant help ask unit attack specific building quickly jumping another warfront coming back trying gather troops notice got seperated lost stuck middle way fuck shit well done update old classic realtime battle game well say game run windows reeallyin opinion real shame ms company big move mean adding extra code game exclude bullshitbad review fix propably never fuck game ran lot disconnection failures really bad experience game issues well documented still aoe thus quite fun many qol changes make game playable personally hated need micro original considering villagers said bugs short couldve much better would wait sale bad game opinion graphics gotten new makeover noticeable improvements ai dumb rocks manage use weapons unless youre looking pvp id look elsewhere seriously giving ai handicap hardest difficulty dont sound installing sounds hell keep disabling god damned narrator every time start game two separate versions first bought aoe de microsoft store multiplayer dead arrival later bough game store hoping xbox achievements automatically unlock steam counterparts oh well probably much handle devs finally found aoe de twice xbox account ms store version represented colourless logo steam version coloured logo versions sets exactly xbox achievements well duhgameplay aoe aged well game officially postwall gates garrisonable towers town centers something like fortresses thus almost every ai raid big potential turn immediate worker drone slaughter creators minimum terms improvements like idle worker button farmland farmer actually walk outside everything stays ai know excactly start pathfinding still worse ant computer screen army formations remain something ancient people werent able fathom lizard brains according gamenations feel unique old tired architecture sets wonders widely shared unit types every single nation seems like greeks roleplaying hittes babylonians egyptians name basically counts cultural appropriation much hated among pc crowd days lolwhat implementing saving restoring multiplayer progress current year late lot money especially today better spend fe food game sorry stateyou may pass regrets volume game ever fix game give fuck ppl buy keeps crashing single multiplayer yay man pathfinding ass yes would recommend game extent played beginning tutorial campaign glory greece campaign didnt notice first later game ai begins become unplayable times pathing game expect original pathing came original title game barebones upgrades features think used come original game never tried multiplayer assume pathing largescale battle mechanics also terrible well bunching villagers micromanaging combat ruined game trip
