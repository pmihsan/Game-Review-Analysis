launching game could introduced mechanics aoe ii ai comes alliancesenemiesin original version could get around making everyone teams locked teams setting onin de seems attack way swarm first kill youi swear ms poor resource management reason picked game bundle deal already aoe ii de comparable successions even improvements de version mean civs unique features even wonders shared pretty much much remember years back positive negative sense right memory lane first pc video game ive seen child looks pretty draw back pathfinding lack variety unit models strange think creators made rubbisheven definitive edition game commands crap everything game sucks game improved graphics cheats pathfinding issues whats love timeless classic pathing awful makes sense still recommend reallllly fix bad pathing villagers get stuck take really long routes resources often bought played like hours games aoe really old game remember nice experiance im sure huge maps huge music lacks magic ancient times sounds like happy utopia lacks war drums feeling keep playing original aoe soundtrack bettergraphic pretty nice comparing old one ofc ui looks like finished fast catch deadlineworst thing game noticed pathfinding units blocks time hard anything units get close stand like braindead zombies willing move seconds move pathfinding damn units something easy apply game another design really annoying make group soldiers try give orders keep roaming around stupidly click click every second fix attempts suicide even worse fact group units want move closer usually click point map waiting till hug area get formation way man dont even try click move order group keep spread move little left right want swordsmen stand one next manually move every single one matter long click move order wont gather pointedit time playing big change dont remember like original aoe like upgraded arrow turrets cannot fast kill one slinger something wrong looks like sake balance made towers super weak ridicilus cavalery units ride base ignore turrets check much turret deal damage unless u upgrade balista civilisation useless never aoe pro remember original game gave fun im constantly losing games lowest difficulty setting bit annoying thats reason difficult settings let weak players interesting game pros even finally win something doesnt really give fun spamming units somehow u ai hard way terrible stupid another example zig zag wall labirynth way base many turrets beside like enemy units follow damn zig zag getting hits turrets wasting resouces instead proper siege catapultsthis game bad cheers la idea de hacer un de del age es excelente pero hay cosas que lo siguen haciendo injugable resolvieron desde la edicion de fines de los una decepcion ya que las civilizaciones diferente jugabilidad que tiene con el age ii podrian haber hecho valer la pena lack buildings gates well sad laggy bad looking ui really annoying prefer original old one looks pretty ai dumber bag rocks dont remember game bad childhood love converting enemies love game shame theres pissing sound initial cut scenes love game far usually write review putting time game seeing many negative reviews people saying crashing issues errorsbugs yet receive crash desktop witnesses bugs game smooth tutorial custom matchesthis game blast brings back used look forward getting home school play look forward getting home work getting kids bed allowing hour relive game know getting grab love game brings back many memories im little disappointed sometimes game crashessave often many core aspects game fantastic new graphics gameplay functionality wonderful manages bring back childlike nostalgia years ago great upgrade original game series except feel one glaring flaw unfair ai scriptsafter hours playing game say certainty ai designed play according rules game one thing always know units times despite never building using scout explore map theyll know soon ready forces defenses weakest proceed somehow walk right defensive perimeter full opposing units strike villagers hidden somewhere inside territory ive tested villager run across map far lineofsight much slower military units ai perfectly follow villager across map back human players unit loses los unit give meaning ai get play los leads ridiculous situations attack villagers far away places shouldnt even know thereon top playercontrolled units seem behave differently aicontrolled units whereas ai units spread attack normal units often get stuck randomly wander units often get stuck unable move units end partially inside ai dont seem problem despite base units buildings close proximity another issue sometimes units ive put defensive stance randomly wander location ive tasked despite absence enemy units pick move another location beyond defend areain last match played writing also issues units retreating opposing unit theyre melee squad hoplites retreat one nearby range elephant archer one number shot arrow know normal melee units attacked range defensive stance entire group move unusual especially remake old game well within defensive area attack enemy comes itlastly wouldnt surprised find ai receive free resources throughout match seems new standard numerous realtime strategy games like dawn war series age empires series halo wars series company heroes series etc past years even old games updated way im guessing easier way program ai developers wouldnt bad thing especially like seeminglyimpossible challenge theres way turn benefit even lowest difficulties someone trying learn play rtss steep learning curve cant one feels wayi hope game rtss include better fairness difficulty controls future video games like one need accessible cant keep modern gamer people disabilities illness etc still want enjoy beautiful piece history less classic game theres wonkiness ais pathing times option use old music limited use old art style worth giving try youve never played movement broken newest update multiplayer lan online many issueseach update breaks somethingget shit together devs hire qa multiplayer really poor get game running crash finish want original aoe play friends sorry self much better shit god terrible way finding still feature ai cheats like crazy constantly pumping best troops rapid pace even cut resources thing better game pretty graphics everything else authentic bs childhood remastered time still remember cheat codes pathfinding clunky keeps original favourite game back days version course graphic beautiful glitch glitch common old version crash crash bots worse old game get stuck technology building population set limits higher paying thanks need optimize lower cpu lagging appear iron age micro unit pop reach nehhh dont game soo buggythe ia enemies dumbit runs little bad dont know game needsto much work nice game however custom campaign outside game bad idea customer experience nice rework lagging played vs bots improvements graphics made lazy people made old one annoying things like way catapults cant set attack stance way villagers get stuck couple seconds meet path annoying pc behave playing game thy attack
