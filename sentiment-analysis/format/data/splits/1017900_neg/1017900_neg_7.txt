monks rather walk around insane bug occur first place cant pass close movingdont buy bugs alone makes game unplayable reward game companies game breaking bugs unfixed year originala poor remake bother numerous long standing bugs like sync errors stuck units tonight alone critical point game get booted due sync error bad oh nostalgia happened better prettier bit rise rome expansion hittite campaign original demo guess idiotic pathfinding spacing units never closes unless one collides another object uniti would seen celtic germanic tribes added alongside aksum nubians inds dravidians aryans well new expansion antique world since palmyrians became autonomous crisis third century arent gallic empire separatist country back short campaign geez okay make custom campaign would better theres somewhat uniquely made civilization alongside old game new look controling military units annoying move around often run away battle two units even lock one position kill one unlock another one nonagresive mode ignore nearby unit attack letting enemy ki one one micromanage units time looses fun annoying still fun would recommend purchase discount eur max sale dont pay full price negative

messnostalgic yes game play nothey devs microsoft time sort game scam get money uslike publishers days sell path finding really bad like worse original amount times plotted really nice attack something effect troops clumping together like idiots half die honestly ridiculous frustrating honestly dont want continue really put work actually improving game total shit path finding bad units stupid population limit ridiculous wonder could play game years ago maybe age empires ii would better well see path finding terrible game compared older version shame liking graphics colour compared older version version seems unplayable even new pccant recomend itthe path finding better limit fps far perfect buy dollars path finding better remastered game new pc pathfind terriblei found game difficult compare another aoe games even editiongraphics nice though pathfinding awful pathfinding really bad units get stuck together wont move ai always gang player deathmatchrandom map turn fight unless put teams manuallyi never found match online checked often dont blame anyone playing online whole pathfinding problem never fixedi love cant recommend anyone pathfinding worse atrocious also ai algorithm still messed upedit cheat achievement works lol pathfinding got bunch farmers happily farming away near town centre well autofarm expect couple farmers walk side map builders replenish farm process diewhy pathfinding terrible every unit military otherwisealso got archers skirmish archers dont worry enemy villager walks past battle archers switch target guy clearly greater threatgood nostalgia though wont refund yet see improves come may played gem long final de editionthis version makes game soooo much better looks great plays wellwas hoping though edition tendency ones units go village idiot mode totally ignore orderscommit suicide stupidity might addressedoh well nothing perfectand proper formation buildingcontrol appears beyond still give poor perfomance overall nostalgia keeps game alive im getting tired lagging everytime fight prone stuttering lag late game lot units computer easily meets recommended system requirements excuse really refund requested refunded sadly recommend crash minutes inform either firewall security anti virus causing clash game turning security systems play game safe refunding game choose latter wait aoe next year better problems riddled bugs unacceptable point time game straight launching game playing notice several bugs overall lacks polished finish original vastly betrays definitive edition tag even talking ai general lack features present game rerelease release even par standard set aoe hd edition much better job meant crippling bugs fps mentioned others seriously dented hopes recommended runs well fun play bored sadly definitive edition doesnt update everything todays standards still outshined sequel age empires iithings began couldnt see thing due tiny ui changed scale ui game reset every time started game seriously manually change file settings readonly keep ui scalebut bigger issue campaigns campaigns population limit time simply way low cant build strong army keeping good economy cull villagers make room army destroy whole navy even likely troops arent enough get troops front ai hopefully economy still strong enoughthere also missions start army navy three villagers order make villagers youd build town center ten houses wood town center destroy whole navy reduce number houses needed start chopping wood three villagersi also want mention first mission babylon start single priest wander around trying find someone convert found villager started convert max range game randomly decided villager would enough kill priest mission failed things cause missions unnecessarily lenghty boring truly missed chance simply perfect nostalgia took alreadydont mind negative comments regarding unit pathfinding ai remastered game decided maintain gameplay mechanics old game greatand dont expect mimick good overrated sucessor aoe first game series far really enjoying game one problem fixed reason update last problem im isnt worst simply sound ever music well anythingthe game still lot fun though sound thing enough keep away entirely subjective review absolutely love definitive edition less hd remaster leaves much original game untouched enjoy imperfect glory said old problems still nostalgia goggles block right solo comprar por nostalgia xd es muy jugable tiene problemas de balance el pathfinde es solo play although buggy really fun either skirmishing ai playing historical
