yet ai never stops sending troops way never stops rebuilding every building destroy easiest bugs like gazelle running stopping midair jump positioni know original game lacked everything mentioned hard would make better pathfinding options troop formations like doubt anyone would complain like original game id lie said played game strategy enjoyable mindlessly build civilization destroy another im going go ahead give game lukewarm review played original age empires back day simply want hd remaster go ahead buy sale like spent ten bucks received many hours entertainment game however youve never played game id much rather recommend one later age empires titles ii iii game terrible mechanics havent aged well frustrating gaming experience example ai ai terrrrrrible soldiers dont theyre told go way way perform simple task theres way program troops ships citizens perform tasks according importance basically micromanage everything else empire collapse ive many cheap deaths due crappy ai loss productivity due massively flawed ai flaws include population capacity along inability destroy ships especially true fishing ships take population theyre done fishing theyre basically waste population would think would fixed many issues remaster simply graphical upgrade game still broken twenty years ago like said fond memories playing game back late early quite enjoyed remake youre new series though strongly recommend ii starting point fixes many flaws original game much enjoyable gaming experience im still looking pathfinding game bad ive change review due recent changes old problems still persists ive playing aoes since long time ive never poor experience aoe hell even enjoyed original issues one oh christ one worst aoe ever come even worse villagers get stuck around gathering applies military units send go command extremely annoying carried original one fixes ever done guess devs considered feature rather bug ever since pop limit several campaign missions renders shit economy translates lagging behind ai several areasnormal speed mode rather slow uninspiring select fast get hammered hard already ahead ai oh say researched techs alreadymovement several military units rather slow melee units hardly catch cavalrychariots ranged unitsthats think right maybe devs worked issues rather called support screen would wayyy betterthats say good graphics never means good game definately applicable hereoh cant disable shitty narrator campaign id stay away rather play newer de like age empires think game still nice except bad ai like play single players games youre fine playing game multiplayer gameplay horrible crashes everytime husband try play game together forgotten empiresxbox game studio fix game poor costumer service managed run game quite hard really funi played mac running parallels windows cinematics choppy starting game change settings lower specs run smoothlyif arent sure game runs setting dont buy played original know changes modern graphics theres also new soundtrack minor changes uiplayability civ balance completely remade campaign maps opinion worth sale price full price considering original still runs windows much much faster lowmiddle end computersvisuals everything gorgeous change zoom level settings even detail gorgeousness giving playability cutscenes replaced voiced actors instructionssoundmusic sounds remade completely original sound replaced rerecorded variants keeping essence original sounds making less repetitive music rescored lost magic wayplayability standard features added gather points autorebuild farms hotkeys depend position button ui units name think reconfigurable units may walk farms possible original changes appreciated civilization bonuses changed slightly better mp balance play random maps using assets want visual features broken ie look worse aoeror example trees shade water waves etc even mode still requires specs de run much worse original older systemscampaigns campaign maps tend follow structure originals havent checked identical sans visual enhancements least similar shape feel maps completely remade didnt feel anything missing noticed maps new gave freshness gameoverall preserves essence original modern graphics audio hard justify paying already original curiosity war time game still ridiculously addicting shameful really eaten urinated hours idea children ive conquered known world half dozen times good game disappointing buggy error error pathfinding ridiculously badnot sure even bought lol download original pains give game negative review thought moved past hd remasters bugs original ai path finding moronic third campaign level soldiers wouldnt attack enemy villagers werent nostalgia factor would completely give game mess cannot stress broken game restart campaign level music previous play keeps playing next game music somehow enemy troops double spawn completely obliterate every time want restart level exit entire game awful select soldiers send fight get glitched toghter cant move im running enemy dont move get killed easily ive lost lot unites way comfy game thats year old talking first game played pc aoeit suffer year old game engine issues expected add nice quality life features present like queues walkable farms etc thats nicepathfinding absolute shit original one feature didnt add formations ai absolute garbage
