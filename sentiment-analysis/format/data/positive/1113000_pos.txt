perhaps best word describe experience persona golden bad part great thats either many things like yet least many things detract experience thing game extremely long issues plus eventual pervading sense bloat add game overreaching overlong even elements shine frequently enough least wanted see end well get positive side think marriage rpg life sim mechanics fairly intuitive meaningful effects accruing money dungeons use real world developing social bonds allow creation stronger personas clever synergy combat usually quite unique fun exploiting elemental weaknesses finding ways opponents proved engaging however boss battles absolute slog two main bosses none following major bosses elemental weaknesses meaning fights devolve tedious whack fests repeating attacks ad nauseum healing necessary boss felled additionally side quests added golden ruin games balance took time complete quests went along left overpowered dungeons became decidedly mindless quests also usually mundane tackedon fetch quests revisit dungeons youve already cleared cant obtain quests pertaining current dungeons bafflingly gameplay loop rooted routine perform limited number actions day usually one daytime activity one evening activity loop really works first enough keep activities varied even felt overwhelming start social links main event optional stories develop relationships numerous characters routine baked long game found autopilot later performing tasks scrolling long walls text hours going motions feeling little long stretches time game also design choices work trekking dungeon consumes day calendar incentivized play much dungeon possible one day clearing one go possible unfortunately bad games pacing rpg life sim elements feel discrete separate rather two integrated parts whole additionally role play element somewhat undermined gameplay implications interactions found pursuing social links characters would grant important gameplay benefits rather characters wanted bond also found trying tell characters thought wanted hear rather wanted character say former would simply benefit gameplay perspective feel game trimmed elements tighter package entire scenes social link characters felt disposable social sim part game number side activities add nothing social stats serve restrict progress certain activities side quests poor inclusion writing mixed bag times game explores interesting themes many characters delightfully entertaining endearing select scenes legitimately funny times characters insufferable games attempts humor fail miserably proves draining entire scenes dedicated extended gags halt plot development social links least could elect pursue social links characters enjoyed helped social sim gameplay along plenty times invested social link stories really bought certain characters experienced personal growth felt great course special mention must go persona treatment particular characters writing ranges mishandled downright distasteful atlus game alright fat character included jokes expense character also victim incessant jokes gay key character development story sees resolving become man reaffirming heterosexuality naotos gender identity whole mess writers clearly equipped tackle game takes many opportunities sexualize underage characters number unfunny slapstick scenes seem contrived entirely purpose placing girls swimsuits games theme acceptance oneself also rings quite hollow text reject several cases game stems company proven miserably intolerant games moral compass also seems bit awry times example one point character equates man losing job murder mans wife presentation decent visuals certainly aged especially character faces environments surprisingly detailed music standout tracks rest mostly serviceable however find reach truth one battle themes perhaps song youll hear easy low point soundtrack unfortunately despite shortcomings made final boss wellequipped dispose yet didnt well pc port one key flaw even close end finally broke motivation see credits simply put game crashes time understand time gpu gets overwhelmed game gives immediately thats bad enough given computers simply running number operations time spikes happen sometimes atlus saw fit release patch surely tidied experience matter fact didnt game much worse lowest resolution setting game cannot play many cutscenes meaning crash consistently thus raise resolution increasing risk crashes everywhere else maybe others wont experience probably saw game go black lock entire desktop least fifty times game crashed leading second phase final boss gave going retrace steps two floors dungeon fight tedious first phase skip dialogue maybe get chance see time crashing worsened games restrictive save system cant save traversing dungeons meaning constantly paranoid losing progress dungeon crawling thus became less fun paranoia ate away enjoyment persona golden might good game good game wrapped layers bloat wants many things doesnt really end great least best qualities lose luster somewhere along overlong runtime enjoy quite time despite flaws eventually game became chore could put faults invested enough story characters want least get conclusion coupling flaws constant crashing dont think game worth time asks jrpgs characters story rich perhaps without many questionable bits accomplish leaner experience forming meaningful bonds characters fighting shadows tv world persona golden offers experience keep players engaged hours come seemed like forever atlus finally put persona title steam sure bring many newcomersploti blast exploring little town inaba wasnt expecting get pulled game much persona introduces player town inaba high schooler moved countryside live uncle cousin heros parents working

thoughts persona golden found working social links could learn persona cast links also help fights makes getting even worthwhile links tricky may want refer guide help properly flesh link links crucial order create stronger personas battle battles persona fun require player think carefully acting sometimes better setting buffsdebuffs instead spamming single button boss fight took several

super funny dialogue little quirks game first felt connected cast characters see many events bonds truly deepen friends even theyre introduced good bit story speaking story story interesting come small town almost soon youre settled hear murder tiny town gets better one thing lacking comparison persona royal gameplay dungeons straightforward find stairs head along way might find key get somewhere compared puzzles basically nothing daily life isnt many places explore youre limited small town halfway summer however lacking compared im saying bad gameplay still amazingly fun going dungeons exploring town finding every little detail small town inaba filled funny characters little places start love persona golden hour game never time gets boring takes bit get going going get sucked straight playing persona decided play persona golden since came steam thanks linkk gifting sadly enough didnt im happy ported since pc finished first play golden story ost characters battle

game word best would put game keep moving word hope atlus would put persona ultimax suplex long story short game alll things need story dating sim please insert coin start persona let game start hope dont play persona steam years old please release asap atlus cool everything else runs smoothly also great due age game play low spec hardware hope atlus sees fact mainline persona games sell great

golden adds much top already amazing experience brainer pick youre fan good storytelling failing understand failing listen rather different things persona truly experience remember first game franchise ive played definitely delivered significant amout entertainment didnt expect considering fact ive pretty much never played jrpgs first thoughts game rather negative though animeish games never attracted even tho love anime approach kinda sceptical first hours tell boi thoughts wrongthe typical weeb slayers cant even stare things second even slight similiarity anime would gritting teeth right seeing games store site overwhelminigly positive reviews hiding store never even trying greatness thus failing listen fact quote beginning directed straightly tell kinda similiar types beginning thats im making deal ive encountered enormous amout people like regarding game anime general point sorry thats rather obvious days cliche saying dont judge book cover would surprisingily powerful situationwell saying wanted say game itselfis f addictinga world inside tv high school drama socializing seemed quite unique first exact reason bought game mostly socializing part nvm plot genuinely intruiging twists place constant enjoyment clearing dungeon getting plotheavy parts might subjective negative part game repetitiveness times repeatedly get objectives rescue person oh rescue someone else completely differentsame dungeon new textures fun like first hours getting kind bored thing still point fact actually rushing game cause literally addicting would taking breaks coming back next day like normal person probably wouldnt case sadly wasdont get wrong tho gameplay actually fun game old aside dungeon thing boss fights super fun ridiculous amout personas fusing fun characters kept playing game almost got pretty much attached actually experiencing thing doesnt happen often case hard get immersed yeah incredibily written characters one particularly mind kanjiwhom meet later without doubt hes best one group complete opposite youd expect laughing ass comedic scenes included pretty much everytime also felt dramatic ones kanji course isnt one thats incredibily written everyone stood opinion basically characters definitely excel game reason realized love game endthe last thing wanted share thoughts beloved soundtrack ah yes pretty much gets praised everyone played persona games theres one big factor deflects awesomeness repetitiveness yes soundtrack alone without doubt outstanding hear many times point almost annoying though persona doesnt many soundtracks considering hours long battle dungeon themesits ones hear boss themes like bosses themes emotional moments etc get point numbers could wrong somewhat like still cant deny soundtrack gets praise damn good reason long ass game take considerationi think negative aspects could easily removed atlus decided make game shorter creating entirely unique dungeon system battle themes single one ultimately enjoyed game much decided write long ass review pretty much sums strong side someone actually read first actual review id appreciate feedback english native language dont go hard regarding p like life simjrpg lives hype skeptical buying first persona game biggest jrpg fan expected quickly tired characters story dubs yes know actually really well done rarity genre characters real lack better words dont feel like idiots actually act like would expect mostly im trying say writing translation great hookedget like stuff akin jojos bizzare adventure typical high fantasy rpgs like

boy howdey atus know youll likely find hating main culprit story writers intended way portrayed actions incredibly welldone text amazing voice acting makes almost sympathize character generic interesting time end game rather cliche good job making feel though youve actually gone adventure characters credits start role youve actually said good bye group friends many games achieve nowadaysoverall good job creating beginning end middle feel rather lackluster since developers focus creating bond main characters main murder mystery taking dragged backseatgameplay place start let begin mentioning social links game social links bonds create teammates less plot crucial characters hanging youre tv lot time feel though social links great giving characters screentime deserve lot arent really interesting instead feeling like creating actual bond certain character felt like optional chore grind many good persona fans know things like slinks confidents theyre known time benefits

varying capabilities vita compared pcs especially considering wideranging pc capabilities really well taken care keyboard controller mapping wellhandled command lists change instantly depending last input used host graphical upgrades options make feel astonishingly smooth even fairly lowend pcim aware havent touched story gameplay deeply dont feel qualified comment without experiencing whole game first however absolutely vouch top notch port game deserves experienced new generation crosssection gamers never interested much jrpgs reason got interested friend mentioned music alone would something id love essentially came music im staying everything one little tip regarding resolution issues seems reason first time game runs ignores native resolution offers people mention didnt issues mention worked exiting game launching correct native resolution option showed playing persona never heard persona series generally steer away jrpgs bought recommendation blown away incredible quality title golden popped steam bought immediately im probably halfway think fair say league persona merits however persona must play rpgjrpg fan art music japanese language voice acting terrific arresting even though pc port previous generations game protagonist title finds murder mystery rural japan halfway point game still guessing dunnit actually game hasnt revealed much shape endgame many story vignettes well done comic vein adolescent themes dealt slightly cringey way wouldnt place teen manga anime combat early dungeons bit cheap youll meet many shadows onehit kill attacks halfway point normal difficulty combat become nicely challenging suspect party overpowered endgame flip difficulty higher partially resource management game player trying get high schools students scarce free time real world sections game great one turn feel navigate heros teenage relationships responsibilities quality writing npc quests bit uneven major npcs fairly predictable character arcs others wellwritten engaging surprisingthere nice extras package tremendous amount playtime gives great value money experience series persona royal really enjoyed time despite particularly low moments loved combat palaces fell especially life sim aspect game typically keen fan twitch action games real time combat nice change pace lose hour experience time spent hanging boys befriending many people possiblepersona golden basically bit focused lot less dips pacing life sim stuff already loved feels even better characters given much say interactions various members group feel lot organic less like theyre simply protagonist protagonist think feeling exacerbated small town setting exudes much stronger sense warmth closeknittedness huge city tokyo sometimes lacked although understand appeal larger scale game genuinely feel though basically perfected life sim stuff unfortunately tradeoff seems dungeoncrawling lot tedious rather telling story environments like combat arenas essentially collection dark hallways containing little way personality sections feel lot like begrudging means end rather opportunity storytelling course im glad atlus chose change approach dungeons later helps turnbased combat still really fun rewarding despite decrease depth combat music dare say even better seriously shocked find soundtrack matched quality even surpassed timesi complained combat bit thats lacks little compared genuinely phenomenal system still really good story one engaging ive ever experienced video game final stretch narrative puzzle pieces slowly fall place adrenaline pumping heart racing harder game since maybe sekiro considering latter brutally difficult action game former fcking turnbased jrpg says lot think please please please give shot especially havent tried persona game serious time commitment wouldnt way trying persona spent little year without really enjoying game played didnt want actually sit butt play seemed tedious task even though playing games always best medicine lifes numerous beatdownspersona brought back joy used feel playing video games enjoy every part game despite fact ive lost couple hours sleep work days suspect lose coming weeks worth thank ask yes played game vitathis favourite persona game main cast alone every girl waifu every guy husbando game easy side compared persona especially smt games story still pretty great dont expect something thats profound persona games oh characters portrayed kiiiiinda bad taste brace bad fat jokes one character particular also choose band practice youll get rather insufferable social linkpersona opinion amazing little rpg worth asking price heres hoping port perhaps even smt games able play game native resolution fps literal dream come true literally one best rpgs time please play able play game pc

development lot selfdescribed narrativefocused rpgs era persona talking sexuality gender identity struggle individual social systems tradition voice acting stellar especially compared contemporaries like final fantasy struggled enormously make jump written text full voiceacting small town lovingly rendered incredible fidelity engaging visual design held points frustratingly samey rng dungeons overtly grind focused quest crafting system disappointing seemed worth putting experience gamenow coming back game needless say many narrative choices bitter swallow game still many points favor anything else say shoji meguros soundtrack remains like nearly everything career triumph replaying shojis games means months running soundtrack compilations background work qualms placing work uematsu great composers game visually beautiful even hd reveals moments ugliness landscapes beyond hospital windows sharply geometric light blooms constant fades black mask missing gestures movements high fidelity tricks exposed tricks highlight extent original team went deliver beautiful product constraints era technology many dungeons cannot escape looking bit dull thanks procedural generation others take advantage simplicity create striking visualsthe characters narrative though game constantly forgets lessons betrays stances go great lengths help person struggling society sexualizes body image turns around encourages sexualizing objectifying travel character struggle sexuality arrive conclusion whatever personality interests deserve respect dignity game uses straightpanic homophobic jokes character clearly struggling gender identity possibility transitioning comes realization accept varied nature relationship gender essentially talked heterosexual romance problem lambasting narratives social links within nearly every one makes good point addresses real human struggle says something positive profound almost cases message ignored cheap laughs wallow lazy tropes times larger story faces similar conflict game contains good murder mystery sufficient exceptionally realized clues help follow along arrive conclusion part hard criticize overall plot however like many jrpgs plot goes crazy hour good reason spoilers old game dealing real culprit path games true ending treated series conflicts beings revealed pulling strings behind scenes whole time terrible writing coming heels good writing plot murder mystery structurally thematically builds conflicts namatame adachi despite knowing ahead time going happen tense nervous nanakos kidnapping approached adachi good villain hes selfcentered resembles fantastic hyperrealized serial killer deploys twisted logic follow monologues resemble real murderers obviously barring persona business pivot sagiris izanami infuriating supported game youve playing point youve experienced weird noir setting done gumshoe detective work surrounded police procedure struggled balancing punishment revenge themes comfortably support mythic fantasy game devolves end making golden tell original team realized extent problem bulk additional content marie attempt pad ending set pieces soften blow izanamis appearance reality taking game

choice expanding main characters interactions adachiall game like final fantasy stumbles finish line many regards frustratingly bungles climax main plot climax many social link sub plots point many outstanding moments incredible emotional impact came side recommending ratio also think important times experience art fails fundamental flaws persona fails queer female characters particular wallows childish homophobic sexist jokes unacceptable time coded frustratingly contradictory subplots moments resonate deeply coming really excited play mechanics sure step fair older game great game enjoy play already coming persona persona royal game still good enjoy lot may mechanics makes sense since game older still resembles persona know nice yet finish game time writing ill probably complete achievements coming persona royal persona honestly shocked honestly interested games premise cast location combat pretty good feel actually challenged compared baby steps taken hardest diff played normal graphics obviously par makes sense considering decade release times even game still brilliant look art style overall even piece interested j u get dollars well worth coming persona certainly different definitely seems like good changes increased difficulty full clearing dungeon day stutters bit thats happens port game pc coming persona wasnt sure expect game easily better story opinion battle system works well bit curve difficulty since early dungeons feel like difficultfor cant go wrong give least hrs gameplay single file still holds really well coming persona richer diverse characters emotional intriguing narrative however really bad dungeon design mechanics dungeon really meaningful causes frustration layout way linear creates one dimensional gameplay dynamics unlike problem affects otherwise excellent combat system literally need go dungeons go combat overall however would say narrative really stands strong music art direction really help make game shine one best persona series coming persona seem primitive years two console generations older given though surprising similar games mechanics pretty much identical story hits basically beats means still enjoyable game even execution much lower levelits fairly obvious ui controls port handheld version ps vita apparently could probably done adapt pc functional though every often im left black screen game running rendering alttab away back fixes coming persona hearing things people said game praise receives well deserved still modern enough aspects gameplay wise still little inferior story characters music much better could write concise review definitely worth time coming persona one may take getting used things like auto aiming dungeons try sneak attack sorely missed one also doesnt action packed beginning persona however stick find intriguing story characters may end liking much persona ones without spoiling much moved country big city sudden random murders start taking place discover real motive behind murders committing anyone familiar persona games right home actual combat plays like typical turn based affair flashy attacks elaborate boss fights order day really like card system end battles given chance chose bonuses end battles bonuses actually negative oftentimes decide worth getting extra draw expense half exp earned yet beat game highly recommend give go nothing else send

heres hoping patch still great game though things considered well worth bucks get past bugs heres hoping get persona pc first want say hate persona life never understand got popular kid every aspect awful made never play persona got persona made think go back play older ones see anything changed give chance still hate persona nothing changed anyone likes persona im sorry said reason bring put perspective others like game worth time still got faults persona course originally like nearly bad story characters opinion charming im nitpicker like complete everything one decided lay back try percent first run like persona tell definitly worth nearly wits end trying one would drive batty look characters like first try bond second playthrough social stats increased go ahead even though remake spouting features original like voice option see others tell alot complaints persona taken care makes bit sad havent played plus side ive managed avoid spoilers game nearly years enjoyable kids like try giving game try adults never bothered want play turn based game might worth shows age combat isnt balanced properly might end tinkering difficulty settings want boss bit harder also want speed trash monsters doesnt interfere social links good solid game ive experienced keeps laughing first im huge fan persona series ive heard many praises game however similarly numerous negative reviews game unplayable face myriad constant freezecrashing issues playthrough dungeon game went least six different freezes mid battle loading screens way able finish dungeon play windowed mode pausing game whenever task manager clocked computer cpu usage mean could play game pausingunpausing game every seconds however port acclaim company seems bit much id recommend game friends freezingcrashinglagaudio issues fixed id say game unplayable game fully playable players recommended specs first im going start review recommending game wholeheartedly doesnt tell whole story see lots didnt like game ill mention bit fundamentals game combat game mechanics solid regardless qualms im fully intending get persona comes steam could persona better absolutely still great game also absolutelyit feels fitting perverse sense persona comes across game two duelling natures conceit game protagonists rather heros friends face side character wish keep hidden gain persona allows fight use magic etc game mirrors duality simultaneously engaging host juvenile cringe comedy really really dislike yet also social links exploring far sensitive darker topics im entirely sure pulls doesif like far fan cringe comedy consider detest type comedy yet still hesitation recommending game thats testament rest gamethe game essentially follows pattern throughoutyou go school interact fellow students people meet whilst part time jobs hero leads friends investigating supernatural serial murder mystery course uniquely placed investigation work generally thwarting another potential murder rinse repeat formula leads far ideal pacing issues sadly dont investigation one go lose sorely needed time build social links raise stats vital want fully complete game speak someone came back bite arse unable complete characters bonding events result needed unlock true ending time read ill probably started second game order long story short optimally play game encouraged dungeons one sitting tonne talking next one optional bosses show redo last dungeon strikes optimal sitting next dungeon thats ideal also ideal game kind peters dont true ending available essentially lot relationship building combat ending screen like said flawedthe actual mystery story strikes strongest final big reveal thats much negative climax seeing murderers identity coming feeling murderer suffered bit evil voice dont get reference english comedy duo called mitchell webb sent hercule poirot dramas sketch noting villainess gets pointed poirot character seems dramatic shift top cartoonishly evil story felt like lot care devoted internal consistency many rpg ive played still gets big nod approval methe combat system good solid turn based system although virtually tactical flexibility comes hero shift personas awful lot potential ones choose create make fulfil role desire whilst friends locked single persona flexibility comes skills keep choose ones discard persona limited game makes bones character centre group friends largely orbit mechanically relationship wiseto honest makes sense comes combat characters flexibility would become unwieldy sadly however relationship angle whilst bad games means women available harem game bonds characters feels rather one note strength bonds mc evoke would feel much stronger two friends entered relationship game progressed say bonds group whole would much stronger alas however ideal game regards unlikely ever released take get least genuine bonds friends even get downplayed else used comedythe music excellent admit heard opening music wonder second let expected track fits placement superbly even stripping back almost completely excellent effect disturbing timesthe quality localisation hearkens back localisation jrpgs era unsurprisingly given game released largely translation rather localisation come across occasional clunky phrases make appreciate far localisation come thats say gets way enjoying story dont worry found nostalgic waysthe voice acting largely decent apart one character nanako felt pretty poor delivery sadly silent protagonist everyone speaks mc mc speaks unvoiced game prompts chose option feels completely unnecessary isnt role play different characters none beats story character interaction changed measurable extent choices ditch silent characterless hero give real depth silent heroes always feel waste potential thats general criticism trope one particular gamethe supporting characters tend painted vivid colours rather true light shade cringe humour gets employed lead caricatures dont deviate far common tropes graphics would expect generation console released upon like many jrpgs ability fall back anime artistic styles allows hold age better many western rpgs similar vein setting game japan rather fantasy nonearth world allowed game stay unapologetically japanese trait really really liked always find jrpgs fascinating way tend incorporate western concepts deities cultures mesh finished product felt like given glimpse japanese culture would normally exposed toso highly recommend game criticisms sound negative remember pick holes yet still hesitate recommend game first amazing made way pcit one best games ever simply play dont get wrong starts slow play love time world characters first cutscenes dont play perfectly system fine though cant give good job every way main game run

however make experience worthwhile people coming back persona honestly say despite looking really dated many ways kinda tbh id honestly say persona stands test time honestly digestible experience

cant really say compares games genre played visual novels like good visual novel persona amazing lovable charactersbut game jrpg vn well put simply majority game vn style albeit greater amount interactivity roam around quiet town inaba spending time friends working jobs general goofing around second half game takes part randomly generated dungeons typical rpg style way two seemingly

sea positive reviews game im probably going make lot points many steam reviewersjust get way like rpgs curious getting one game fantastic start scene personasmt series say game super easy understand enjoy pc port game also comes custom difficulty option want challenge less grinding way around theres also preset difficulty options gameplay turn based first auto sets characters ai controlled switch direct commands highly suggest ai doo doo fart yeah super fun gameplay thats itthe depending play guess could call social sim game goes calendar based system certain actions take time certain actions performed certain time day sounds confusing talk social link characters better idea want day whether upgrading certain social stat deepening bonds corelate strong protagonist personas sometimes party members personas strikes perfect balance rpg daily life stuff theres always certain deadline need get dungeons done makes plan ahead lets move story cast story takes place rural town called inaba theres strange kidnappings murders taking place job save victims murdered thrown inside tv dungeons manifest go cast game far cannot stress enough outshines persona games everyone unique unique charm character development goes whole game social links arcs like persona major case moving soundtrack game phenomenal persona bit better way quality songs theyre also full length persona best music ever heard complaint overused ton short dungeons constantly loop heres talk negatives game poses get fixed updates fixed persona games dungeons pretty lame opinion randomly generated layout objective find stairs idea could enviornments floor well doesnt feel like getting sense progression time want save leave use item go back entrance annoying remember buy games optimization sometimes shotty instance attack game drops frames second picks back ive heard cutscene lags crashes occured never expirienced fixed issues open beta game steam properties theres lot misc qol changes feel like couldve implemented port doesnt effect joy game poses really conclusion game jam packed content good game couldnt tell review sure game short comings lot jrpgs fall victim everything going perfect every player game charming outshines issues half time wont even notice game classic expirienced least rpg fan around hours content freaking steal amazing game bbuy b dont really know say hasnt said alreadyi mean mainline persona going multi platform first time fact alone pretty big incentive buy itit also helps game pretty amazing even remotely like jrpgs owe least try itbut end day fricking persona fun stylish pc game loved many good reason game even remotely piqued interest chances going love itbuying might also make atlus open porting games elsewhere thats neat dont really know put enjoyed shit persona back refused buy vita golden long last return inaba enjoy delicious new social linksfor real everything opening theme first awakening really brings back good ol days want nostalgia kick want play good jrpg finished persona royal want hand crazy uncle sticks goddamn itps naoto best girl dont think could praise game enoughthe gameplay amazing game soundtracks best ever heardif thinking giving game go say go find getting lost time realising hours past since booted upi dont issues game dont think anyone debating whether game great sure amazing worth length story well actual quality port great havent problems whatsoever yet game runs really well pc dont think people understand much wish bathe sweat chie satonaka please god world live allow life time bathe within comfort chies sweat even take marie chie limits please need dont think something needs said game masterpiece classic everything story characters gameplay music memorable amazing enjoy turn based rpgs lot planning involved youll doubt fantastic experience youll still enjoy story love characters makes game worth remember play game experience dont think theres point talk point beyond totally worthwhile addition base game definitely best version game would highly recommend anyone even slightly interested buy game support atlus bringing games pcnow thats way im going discuss port thats probably informative saying persona classic every rpg fan experience performancethe port bare bones performance doesnt seem issue ive played desktop along acer notebook nvidia mobile graphics years ago got basically smooth gameplay optionsthe options menu incredibly basic almost graphical tweaking thats really problem considering year old game however annoying bugs like game sometime opening windowed mode despite options saying fullscreen full key rebinding option plus cant comment high resolution scaling since play display ive heard text scaling issues higher resolutions google buying dealbreaker youcontrolsdont play kbm unplayable odd camera controls mouse reason use controllerbugswell ive experienced hard freezes restart pc im pretty sure related controller disconnectingreconnecting loose usb cable would momentarily cause game stutter sometimes freeze entirelyanother major bug shadows dungeons unbearable youre playing uncapped fps shadows movement speed engage combat tied fps much harder get player advantage long time realized much easier fpsaside major issues game worked perfectly fine totally worth price admissionfinal note dont buy digital deluxe edition want ost doesnt tracks artbook stuff find google images already buy want support atlus beyond content isnt really worth itanyway games go fucking buy finish dont understand game better writing character development compared games come several years gripe possibly retrieve quests rng involved optional dont usually get addicted games want engrossing game buy dont usually like jrpgs much persona games super cool hopefully atlus ports games steam dont usually play many jrpgs well specifically traditional turn based combat titles mean played like paper mario ttyd earthbound prior usually experience jrpgs limited said persona golden great game first persona title finish vanilla persona years ago love game definitely worth especially price anybody doesnt know persona jrpg spin shin megami tensai line created atlus play group teenagers personas personas represent characters overcoming weaknesses like yosukes fear rejection outcast gameplay represented two forms social sim aspects turn based combat part socializing certain people help certain arcana classes im knowledgeable arcanatarot card systems persona like socializing gives reason gameplay wise also reason individual character storylines give greater insight characters thinking reacting certain things certain way also fuse personas stronger ones egor margarettes help dungeons created characters subconscious fearsanxietiesflaws push away peers dont see flaws issuesand helpedare gifted personas unique also fight lot shadow beings help level personas party team also understand dungeons represent psychology theory idegoand super ego id wants desires matter costthe ego keeps keep id checkand super ego moral compass keeping regular ego check im psychology expert see thematic sense persona titles character sees worst parts amplified top degree reject fear thus must beat boss shadow representing character order overcome worst aspects person really cool aspect series gives something titles dont usually tackle certain stuff persona doesnt even smt understand goes entirely different story stuff persona think fine persona pretty great plot characters great arcs around ask mei recommend also personally trying finish dungeons possibleuse free time socializingbooks read stats like intelligence couragebuying armor weapons help give party edge battle also going back dungeons defeat optional bosses helpful armor weapons also helpful giving edge level ups overall great system mechanics gameplay loops make party stronger think anything else gonna play persona golden character writingplotmystery element storyand atmosphere strengths think persona refined polished persona persona lesser gameof course think gameplay loop excellent persona lively community inaba characters connect back eachother like one big happy family persona contrast bigger game fine sacrifice livelier community bigger shibuyathis thing sell lot persona merits gameplay bad underwhelming far persona generally tend certain strengths persona doesnt thats fine think anything else thats makes recommend persona general mention adjustable difficulty option hard time real issue persona fair expect sequels dungeon layouts dont generally tend emphasize

party member get game unlocks persona avatar representation inner power special powers main character ability equip huge number personas unique skills stats strengths weaknesses also somewhat similar guardian force worked suppose also personas also fused together form new personas inheriting skills ones fused elements game directly influenced social sim elements hence constant balance typical dungeon crawling normal lifeits pretty cool idea time works really well gameplay needs story needs complement wouldnt work course gameplay basics werent fun heres persona especially good combat game genuinely engaging fun exploration dungeons getting treasure chests entering fights shadows somewhat bland helped cool visual design awesome soundtrack fights great theyre almost always smart use strengths weaknesses enemies check enemies figure theyre weak hit weakness get extra hit knock everyone get special whole team attack big damage numbers adapt new situation often jrpgs either really tedious fights never pose challenge feel like time wasters way complicated huge amount interesting systems mechanics dont care pace turnbased combat like get overwhelmed tired fight persona part keeps fights brief enough also keeping every one engagingthere annoying exceptions course design decisions frustrating anything like fact main character dies game ends randomly happen quite often start game

really hard grinding part game even severe get least fights fun annoying go takes time youd hope wouldwhich another thing didnt enjoy much game really really long enough stories moments fill time quite lot great emotional story overall bit trite journey persona make feel like youre hanging weird friends ends sad see end time many predictable tired tropes everywhere quite characters stereotypes arent interesting explore even main story potential something amazing would take seriously enough avoid tropes ends giving typical save world ancient beings blah blah elements fine heroic epic jrpg hero person saves world evil feel place tale focuses much interacting people personalities characters also key choices affect ending really badly phrased dont fit dialogue system game oh also jokes situations eyerollingly bad typical teenagers teenager things anime joke stuff wasnt funny feels tone deaf ive seen many gay panic jokes since last time ive watched michael bay movie however long ago

fun also naoto best girl really enjoyed amazing one best soundtrack gaming also amazing gameplay awesome animation wonder anime really enjoyed persona much played royal release came since wanted play game couldnt justify buying ps vita one game playing completing story true ending persona golden fine game indeed clearly see many people love cast characters general tone game great possibly even better persona despite game serial murder quite lighthearted doesnt lose overemphasising world themes mark good game make feel variety emotions playing persona balances humour dark elements sombre scenes well though social links fairly straightforward good job making emphasise like game takes full advantage smaller setting world compared persona especially locations explore game seven main areas four fully explorable freeroaming areas works games favour though gives player sense attatchment world allows familiarize town quickly love dungeons used explore key characters persona dungeons represent desires various criminals however persona dungeons used explore characters actually care save battle quite literally inner demons makes feel much determined complete dungeons better understand characters even actually clearly refined games sequel see lower section soundtrack amazing knows amplify themes game help express important emotional moments peaceful days special mention goes home soundtrack changes spoilerthe time nanako kidnapped nobody home really makes want save even spoiler anime cutscenes great real treat every time one appears cap important moment game also really like opening movie technical level terms port pretty solid staying consistently throughout except rare occasions game wants display animated cutscenealloutattack whatever reason terms content port youre pretty much getting full package theres hitches though see section youre interested however experience image ghosting frames especially evident turning camera though didnt significantly impact experience nanako didnt like digital deluxe bundle total waste money get hastily thrown together pdf file containing pages art already possible unlock game low quality music tracks lets honest youre going listen youtube anyway chucked random folder dig game files get persona definitely refined gameplay persona number ways leading quite jarring first especially played game first really evident dungeons randomly generated mazes opposed expertly designed palaces sequel unfortunately make going dungeons bit slog especially shadows hitbox appears roughly size pea thankfully basic combat system holds well even without refinements baton pass system persona gameplay loop still maintains interest even sorely miss bells whistles made sequels dungeon crawling much entertaining side note love shuffle time minigame might get battle adds unexpected layer depth dungeon crawling despite simple concept actually wish carried forth mentioned however despite actual rpg elements refined persona eager progress story particularly interesting dungeons tying important characters enjoyed progressing dungeons see happened next assets havent quite scaled well viewing monitor opposed handheld game designed ui elements feel like scaled bit big especially text real shame also couldnt find higher quality files anime cutscenes definitely look quite grainy running game high resolution models textures also appear bit blurry although nice changed character portrait art use high resolution assets bonus materials removed port trailers anime adaptation pretty good anime way unlike persona animation well clips music event trailers previous persona games information persona arena port also doesnt include interviews japanesekorean cast part bonus material none cuts worth losing sleep removed contain obsolete information anyway looked online japanese voice seems pretty compressed low quality whatever reason whereas english voice seems use much higher quality recording plot persona interesting kept guessing throughout even spoileri guessed fairly early leading slightly disappointed twistspoiler extra dungeon added form spoilerhollow forestspoiler good enjoyed integrated story spoileralthough dungeon bit gimmicky enjoyable sort seems like came paper didnt consider fun would practicespoiler really surprised however spoilersecond twist last day game really loop many lingering questions didnt see reveal coming actually quite impressed although wish true ending wasnt tacked behind series actions almost require walkthrough find spoiler pc port brings potential mods interesting see modders enhance game steam course comparing persona sequel bit moot point given sequel improved many ways however fans persona like want give previous entry go hearing great things think fair point differences even persona smooths rougher edges present game would argue youre getting good interesting story cast characters excellent fastpaced style combat fantastic world fall love fantastic game actually makes question ideas morals game isnt afraid make player contemplate important themes tests morals choices affect outcome game becomes higher work art like successor persona golden oneofakind masterpiece realises genre fullest potential really enjoyed playing game soundtrack amazing along cast characters would recommend game anyone loves playing jrpgs really enjoyed

welllets hope atlus continue releasing games steam thought dreaming man really persona golden pc japannese audio thank much atlus love rip vita emulator thought pretty cool thought wasnt going good wow wrong took chance persona golden back ps vita time didnt really know expect certainly didnt expect become one favorite games timebefore knew ended exactly thanks fun engaging murder mystery story wonderful soundtrack unique blend rpg social sim gameplay strong unique cast charactersyou take role silent protagonist forced move family small countryside town inaba year eventually new friends end getting wrapped serial murder case decide work together save victims bring killer justice youll explore dungeons fight enemies turnbased battles typical rpg inbetween dungeons youll live days ordinary high schooler hang people around town read books watch movies go fishing work parttime jobs simplest way describe gameplay would part social sim part dungeon crawler former real draw game youll spend majority time persona else building relationships others key grants bonuses abilities help battle also reward see character grows big part fun figuring efficient way spend time see characters story end reason keeping multiple saves highly recommended hand also important accept simply wont see everything first playthrough even guide try get bogged optimizing schedulepersona goldens biggest strength lies main cast theyre one lovable memorable group characters ive seen game thanks part stellar english dub cast interactions always joy watch bounce well really feel like believable group friends course story end coming literally facetoface suppressed inner thoughts negative emotions running theme game importance selfacceptance one favorite characters example difficulty gaining acceptance others due society viewing hobbies feminine people constantly deride unmanly hobbies result puts macho begins lash others keep getting close fear rejection character arc struggle break free false labels placed others accept really isyoull also come know plenty characters outside main cast hitormiss always looking forward seeing stories unfolded one case even ended turning around character negative first impression learning soundtrack incredible hands one favorite osts game perfectly complements games smalltown setting generally easygoing vibe almost every song instantly memorable insanely catchy still find relistening day due games structure length tracks youll hearing ia loti personally never grew tired themfor game right dungeon crawling undoubtedly biggest flaw dungeons incredibly barebones consisting long stretches randomly generated hallways doors enemies fight occasional treasure chest loot although battle system fastpaced easy understand dungeons start feel like slog thankfully unlike original vita release fine tune difficulty time start allowing alter amount damage give take even amount exp money gain bandaid solution find getting frustrated plus like game terribly difficult first place least normal idea first playthrough breezed everything past first couple dungeonslength another common valid criticism game ilong regular playthrough take around hours making pretty big time commitment somewhat related obtuse requirements obtaining true ending surprisingly easy lock getting important save often make use every save slot given unless youre actually willing start whole new playthrough miss one thing ill say regarding getting true ending prioritize spending time certain character aeon arcanahonestly cant recommend game enough anyone whos fan jrpgs andor characterdriven stories fact serious steam review ive ever written probably ever write say lot much love one games ive played really managed stick long credits rolled much also

pointless going already negative opinions persona games fan base wanted experience fully thoroughly making definitive conclusion generally enjoy rpgs visual novels play structure game alone couldnt something wouldve bothered unless content poor content inconsistent social aspects game town roaming stat boosts myriad ways increase different meters leading perfectionist run pretty satisfying appeals sense completion rather desire enjoy different people meet say primary amount individuals come across either inconsistent written poorly simply unlikable times wanted enjoy character looks personality links would either come shallow show form character progression irrelevant character thus far say didnt enjoy characters development course link completed many ended leaving disappointed point driven fell flat pushed aside another plot whats worse player constantly told youre close people see time great friends end really disliking personality traits see people put high regard towards certain party members theyre constantly horrible person never grew weaknesses makes feel like didnt even play game decided watch bunch cutscenes try draw theyre assumption character wholly mention characters share almost completely identical personal issues tackle differently makes end disliking ones handled poorly comparison honestly makes wish characters cut game nah gotta fill tarot card deck even youre forced put half baked character story linesmusic solid part lot bad songs lot good songs much taste case mostly disappointment lack satisfying variety really love though main plot starts pretty generic gets wildly confusing saturated mainly due fault goldens additions make continuation story wasnt previously present guess add something make game longer felt artificial forced unfortunate intended answer foundation relevant questions handled better probably wouldve given story creditart direction design range pretty bad times beautiful got little bit everything ugly side portraits pretty landscapes though time looks like generic rpg know long time people said persona style design best may true time games release doesnt really stand anymore blindingly unfortunate yellow constantly present game sorry dont like yellowsomething worth mentioning long base game assuming youre going normal ending still around hours sense get quite lot much spent though honestly wouldnt buy unless around one largest determining factors much time end burning partly due reading half dedicated dogshit design rpg combat starts fairly simple easy pick quickly turns mind numbing monotony probably people bought game actually got basic good ending even enjoy basic rpg driven combat something along lines old final fantasy pokemon end forced play style lacking diversity opting focus things like allmighty attacks instant kills enemies stop weaknesses vulnerable one form damage mish mashed groups similarly styled enemies feels almost deliberately intended waste time areas game dont require fight enemies others force face constantly enjoyment game probably measured fairly accurately dungeons alone besides one character specifically every side quest game feels like huge waste time shouldnt bothered requires pointless backtracking absolutely awful rewards variety nonexistent almost always pattern exit dungeon revisit dungeon enemy drop turn get awful item repeatthe experience wasnt completely horrible though side characters genuinely compelling story lines golden ending opinion forced honestly kinda dumb give satisfying ending whole thing video games best described food analogies persona golden like burger keep hearing twitter get looks pretty flashy high hopes first tastes pretty average wonder hype end getting really sick eat youre disappointed hungry meat looks good lift bun see random crap makes wanna stop right moms money dont wanna waste keep eating time youre done feel awful wanna lie shower let hot water wash away disgust didnt puke going hopefully youre wise enough listen people like eh game ok kinda annoying dont recommend unless sale emperor death hanged towers really good never afraid call popular things bad based content

informationa review game product porting work feel game known quantity people looking page originally saw game played giant bomb wanted play wasnt buy ill offer anecdotal experience porting work happy say port seems pretty solid isnt perfect goodthoughts keys rebindable game keys bound function keys tilde etc ones might want alphanumerics alt ctrl caps lock etc game discriminate leftright ctrl etc handy someone like ive remapped windows key right ctrl input controls similarly perfect abomination certainly heavy streak console port behavior going ie emulated buttons menu brought tab key vs escape making menu selections little awkward doesnt work exactly like youd expect native pc game however great credit mouse behavior great half baked may enter name one character time vs typing backspacing keys thats works controller click letters quickly dont move cursor keys use dang mouse lot poorer console pc ports fail aspect something take granted ports character movement pretty good though qualified success pretty good port wasd default works bat granted game still designed ground controlled analog stick look little stiff quickly move hard snap though transition characters heading switch directions moving right change direction left character turns vs instantly facing right may seem pedantic thing talk way movement works fundamental gameplay mechanic janky movement would absolutely big effect experience especially game like takes hours hours play graphics settings rather sparse much issue though since game old performance still rock solid need turn anything rendering scale option defaulted buttery smooth monitor im content enough leave everything defaultsmaxed call day game looks good runs good sure much due efficient optimization little render screen sure really care though like low poly art tell texture resolutions never meant seen looks nice counts seems lot assets reworked rather recreated outright stuff looks uprezzed cleaned bit vs redrawn scratch youre one people thought wolfenstein remake looked bad port might eyesore doesnt bother wasnt expecting hd remaster anything keep mind nice cleaning game still game heart expectations kept check reguardless strength original art design ensures still looks great major bug first started apparently amd cards owners issue models get stretched place got sapphire pulse xt igors polys screen dude looked like got hit ied simple graphics driver update solved thisin summaryoverall id say dang good port team clearly work within limitations imposed original capabilitiesconsole native design

love game honestly game hits vibe persona point really feel sucked world really game amazing complaints lack symbols name skills constantly remeber skills meant also camera angels dungeons god awful recommendation isnt enough fully explain great game series whole recommendation play costs relationship game tales symphonia heard praise years till finally got play didnt like first started think whatever game truly became worthy praisepersona ultimately cute ride im glad got play said wasnt solid hours started carve name itselfthis port psvita version game additional content made port thats fineso essentially enhanced directors cut game made possible vita copy pasted pctheres plenty little things make reminiscent time story beats entire gameplay pieces kept behind way npcs repeatedly things multiple times wouldnt think check unless absolutely everything features like ability refill health magic dungeons without leaving skill tree enhancements party members quest lines unfinishable without telling need order fix couples things point outits clearly meant game play times near impossible everything one go though game takes long though core gameplay elements wish straightforwardthe good news dont want spend time world grinding learning ins outs combat select difficulty right gate want story world persona make feel something set brain dead mode nothing challenge likewise game beat kneesunless particularly fond combat system aims starve resources dont bother least far normal mode went hardest stuff first couple dungeons simply cause lacked things like large enough magic meters small hp refills low items simply knowing enemy weaknessesit worth noting combat lacks makes writing wont go much detail since better play first however littlest details eventually amount something longrun plan playing tend forget things theyre brought factbig question im sure asking long take finish gameit took roughly hours beat main story sidequests fair bit grinding post game normal mode fast forward text cutscenes making go fasteras far glitches go ran maybe three entire time frequent game would go windowed mode despite set fullscreen happened lot dual monitors especiallythe second game softlocking battle one party members used personathe third using speed option combat start battle game straight crashedhopefully things patched eventually id mostly say careful using speed optioni wish least quality life improvements help streamline certain things however long kind guide let know terriblefinal verdict hope got persona games future soon review game good although long time ago release playstation vita late release pc like story since never play playstation vita playstation hope future persona game release pc second jrpg game gonna lie didnt think would finish full play actually ended finishing twicetotally recommend never played jrpg beforebtw rise waifu second persona game one top jrpgs list time game left feeling drained way ending great

undisputed favorite game time story characters music unparalleled even todays standards every rpg learn thing two persona series especially youre turnbased combat might slog honestly think give shot

musicvery immersive game combat takes bit thinking strategy characters quirkyi love game presents spoiler reviewi completed game u played like dont tell u u play game u never played persona game first first persona game steam give u reasons u try game well criticisms social sim dungeon crawler main features game dungeon crawling jrpg aspect social sim features game unlike momentos dungeon crawling intertwined main social links things u dungeons still relate u outside open world quests quest mostly fetch quest requiring u return dungeons complete extending play time nothing say dungeon crawling standard like feature battles allow u gain extra turn u exploit weakness enemy get critical hit fact enemies also earn mores makes fights dynamic fun social sim side enjoy characters relate ways theyre incredibly flawed unique qualities help stick one another allows remember time fondly npcs games interacting main party members also allows u gain new skills really useful almost game breakingly socriticism gear based level systems game although skills characters specifically personas carry u game often level gear important getting level max every character really easy best gear every character much harder satisfying things makes fight even boos fights laughably easy augmented powerful personas every enemy cake walk even hardest story enjoy mystery story told like pacing well even major dumps certain parts context makes sense involvement characters also enhanced story unlike set small city means characters familiar one another antagonist protagonists interact frequently allows better understand characters intention motivation getting invested main character stats main character stats knowledge diligence courage expression understanding stat levels dialogue option require least certain level certain stat order choose option result different dialogue moving forward different outcomes encourages u replay game stats u improve carried new game allowing u try new

ive finally completed game finally say persona golden favourite series thank god steam port okay since reviews either shitposts vague explaining exactly ill insteadpersona part series called shin megami tensei games play similarly pokemon except rather trying catch every monster run fuse get rid weaker ones get stronger demons majority smt franchise gameplay formula however persona series puts different spin series taking dungeon crawling smt adds unique mechanic spend time living normal life hanging friends things like homework working level stats things portion game directly influence one anotherits perfect game definitely flaws first theres mechanic called social links spend time characters day spending time give xp boost certain types demons fuse problem comes links party members mechanic works well side characters lock character development behind completely optional game mechanic becomes issuethe dungeon crawling also isnt really best series offer go either okay making want stab eyes fork moments far battles pretty fun still best series offerthe important part rpg story game pretty good one story simple friends trying track serial killer discover ability enter another world inside tv theres also speculation world something killers methods fairly simple somewhat engaging story best part characters said story theres lot time put characters hang funny conversations really able connect game really make characters feel like real people towards end kind feels like game dragging long serves cover plot holes arent left unsatisfiedas every smt game story experienced entirely without play games start still enjoy itin must enjoy classic jrpgs rate okay absolutely adore game im really glad see come platform isnt vita thing port absolutely abysmal gameplay least runs relatively well enough yet every single cutscene anywhere laggy mess completely unwatchable without modding game thats even getting constant crashes game made vita sure port made specific build doesnt

social links missed ton game theres reason finished two weeks beautiful genuine masterpiece im happy got experience anyone questioning buying game disappointed whatsoever one single playthrough took hours minus ton extras didnt know existed till later game value per dollar spent triple games released past decade favor get already get digital deluxe itll give atlas sega reason release games franchise pc ive played alot rpgs life one game ive actually felt bondyes pun included bite characters every new day new chapter stories reason keep playing mention childish hilarity constantly happeningone thing wrap rise overrated chie best girl bought game expecting enjoy great reviews one friends recommended im somewhat fond genre games well bought far literally worst game ive ever played far whole two redeeming qualities hand drawn cutscenes look really good even though graphics rest game awful story far isnt terrible even though feels really cheesy stupid like even begin explain game badwell might well start fact theres gameplay vast majority game far consisted sitting listening dialogue parts walk around freely parts usually handful things see places go kind defeats whole point able move freely also bunch turn based combat ill talk later isnt necessarily problem ive played games spend time listening people talk choosing dialogue options thing games dialogue usually interesting game boring lines dialogue made feel anything far ive playing five whole hours another thing games little gameplay last maybe hours usually writers good enough compact entire story hours playtime make things interesting still get point across also force players nothing sit listen dialogue hours end game last like think around hours absurdly long time game feels like im playing visual novel last thing usually games like dialogue options player chooses feel like weight affect story way game dialogue options far feel like little consequence fail interesting point ive begun picking first option time know none ones going affect story way terms story keep mind ive played hours isnt terrible feels really cheesy dumb worst thing ive ever seen guessokay lets talk combat combat game mind numbing turn based combat ive ever sit entire life surprise actually ive ever played maybe one two turn based games ive enjoyed yeah combat game mostly consists brute forcing way though every fight first trying find moves deal damage enemy spend rest fight pretty much spamming move limiting factor regard limited number action points play skills felt really annoying combat awful wanted get fast possible anything made fight longer real nuisance prizes get completing fight feel lackluster unrewarding felt like insult every time game forced sit whole fightfinally music graphics suck mentioned earlier hand drawn graphics cutscenes look amazing animation rest game looks completely awful even game made kind wish whole game hand drawn animation would least nice look even though nothing else good since game spent dialogue combat turn based really reason game first place whole game could animation nothing would really change apart graphics better music im definitely music critic dont listen music often far havent heard single track likea lot people ive talked say game starts boring gets better like come five hours kind really long time go without anything interesting happening ideally would want get players hooked beginning ton things dont like game dont want talk right overall real praise give game experience ive far utterly terrible couldnt help laugh everything thats happened far even think kind high price pay game intend play ironically since cant refund game point might get around playing whole thing give fair review also kind dont want sit like hours worst game ive ever played far theres also good chance wont found persona series emulation first emulated persona best experience ever saw came steam knew get eventually regret

automatically look better resolution detail textures larger objects stretch much worse like mountains fields backgrounds pretty gross pc im fully expecting crazy fans try texture replacement mod something sound sound automatically set level individual sliders music sound effects voice voice overpowering others felt turn notch comparison others odd usually games need turn voices musicfx thing

music sometimes want leave going send email great aunt jude steam achievements absolutely awesome another avenue finding things try party combinations etc crashes alt tabbing hasnt weird slow clicking borderless fullscreen like games best practically zero loading times time ive seen black screen second two design choice pacing game wish sometimes videos could bit higher quality available would love see highres cutscenes optional download great wish crisp games ui oh wtf settings menu text descriptions menu option says say thing title needless repetition makes screen look unnecessarily full unless sort localisation thing id looking sorting sega deluxe extras probably downside aud extra low quality would essentially page book folded art clean markety materials rather showing real behind

pretty relatable story struggles teenagers emotions demons feeling powerlessness life feelings inadequacy life love searches belonging perceptions abandonment difficulty reconciling others expect gender effects life even sexuality bit exaggerated dramatic purposes real struggles lots young people go isnt sort thing youd expect game like address sort thing youd expect well yet really pretty remarkable job delving characters found annoying makes sense realize theyre teenagers trying figure means annoying makes sense game story dense extent virtually impossible see first go character based everything revolving around interactions people inaba become powerful terms game mechanics forming bonds people also really bulk game story isnt dungeon crawler probably spend way time going dates fighting monsters party either lot randos inaba enter friendships undergo lengthy meaningful story linesthe voice acting generally quite good although imo rises japanese va absolute moe nightmare good theres lot combat guess found pretty easy got hang even able fell tougher bosses without much trouble realized needed max social links party asap regular enemies easy enough frequent encounters honestly become pretty annoying said didnt find combat engaging thought great served story magnificently fighting goblins mudcrabs youre fighting suppressed thoughts inner demons characters know eventually come like rather cobbling story together around combat game opposite works wellthe graphics game quite old point hd textures help still unmistakably game portraits look good animated cutscenes game holds better lot brightly colored unique memorable style said really shouldnt playing games expecting photo realistic graphics game pretty good quibbles notably twists end bullshit look

superb pc port great psp remake awsome gamethe game one guy stuck small town year guy trying solve mass murder mystery new friendsgolden easier personas manegment compared original game greatcombat engaging annoyng unlike persona companions suck ass fn retarded moronsalso game autosaves every dungeon level making dungeon crawling less dangerous originali hope atlus release persona royal pc also perevious titles intention buying quality sonys conole dropping tremendously release new console forever reminds makes happy review comes someone played persona recently released persona royal however ive heard many good things persona golden happened buy game release day sunk hours plan ng soon originally going write review halfway game felt finishing game would allow better perspective pros cons game safely say however game masterpiece hit jrpg lovable characters emotional story great music battle system simplistic yet addicting comedy point numerous personas create via fusion plentiful great design blend life simulator dungeon crawling may seem odd however urges player manage limited time wisely everyday choosing whose social links prioritize activities engage negative aspects people may enjoy fact persona golden originally came ps vita age definitely shows sp management dungeons also issue newcomers make first dungeons particularly difficult despite cons game consistently builds upon theme facing challenges life dollar jrpg hours depending much optional content partake believe entirely worth price time make history review goes got spoiled major event game wondering game still worth picking upyes absolutely identity someone important spoiled literally day released say yes detract mystery game much offer cannot simply spoil everything game offer words even sentencesincredible writing lovable characters incredibly indepth combat system hundreds hours contenti would recommend game anybody likes good story even dont typically like turnbased rpgs something everyonehowever despite high praise game isnt perfect dungeons imo boring especially coming persona every dungeon flat plane corridors laid randomly floor dungeons also usually contain floors floor take minutes complete prepare lot game also difficulty hikes entirely easy depending playstyle tedium dungeon layouts starting skip enemies rush dungeon single day lead bosses able onehit ko entire party however dont feel bad whatsoever turning difficulty change damage deal damage taken exp gained money gained overall difficulty find falling asleep dungeons like bump difficulty easy worry clearing whole floors enemies progressstill gripes aside believe best rpg steam right cannot recommend game anybody wants experience something truly unique rpg games youll find well made persona im assuming well probably check daynow port persona royal steam cowards review intended others like introduced persona series fell love jumped opportunity try older entry series without buy ps vita absolutely adored spent hours playing vanilla royal editions review comparing also im giving scores individual aspects game graphics sound story etc final score overall impression game average scores section tldr think superior game overall read reasons however still greatly enjoyed totally understand many prefer visuals serviceable visuals weak point even taking account original released ps vita games era look better eg final fantasy x released looks better game blows game water comes visuals age like fine wine due bold neonoir artstyle compare menus ui loading screen youll see amount polish refinement visuals compared sound soundtrack jpop jrock vibe stark contrast acid jazz soundtracks incredible still prefer soundtrack overall absolutely loved one overall sound production quality mixing etc definitely superior game still sounds great shoji meguro genius gameplay dungeons almost every gameplay element refined notably dungeons dungeons randomly generated change every visit every dungeon basically thing different skin mementos widely regarded one tedious aspects every dungeon basically mementos ambushing enemies also quite different ambush enemies hitting behind weapon hitbox targeting kind janky might standing right behind still whiff also lot narrow corridors like mementos difficult sneak behind shadows wait eventually turn around takes way long ended fighting lot battles head missed hearing reach truth plays ambush enemy certain boss battles enemies enemy design somewhat uninspired basically every dungeon monsters palette swapped gain personas reward cards end fight enemies personas collect like catching pokemon theres way enemy diversity also fairly easy game beat whole thing almost exclusively using izanagi main character doesnt particularly good stats attributes frequently change actually use newly acquired personas particular relied heavily upon null physical attribute never bothered quests quests predominantly tedious fetch quests largely involve revisiting previous dungeon farm items enemies stopped realized lacklustre rewards quests mementos missions take boss way fun interesting imo fighting random shadows gain find one drops particular item youre looking social linksconfidants social linksconfidants overall quality better sociallinks encountered throughout course main story whereas many social linksconfidants totally random people dont anything seek eg devil death hermit tower hanged man sun moon temperance strength also ranking confidants unlocks abilitiesgameplay perks provides incentive complete whereas ranking confidants gets exp boost fusing persona arcana games reaching max rank unlock ultimate persona arcana freedom things night vastly prefer morgana constantly telling go bed although improve however tedious going different locations see social links confidants available whereas available confidants conveniently displayed mapstory characters shines theyre incredibly endearing really get attached game progresses plot isnt particularly original doesnt even matter strong characters makes want keep playing see next interaction group friends personally prefer cast plot easily see many would prefer cast however definitely develops final member party far better counterpart despite less ingame time rest cast character felt fullyfleshed integrated team everyone else werent able accomplish final party member new characterconfidants handled better compared theres really compelling reason spend time new character aside sake extra content whereas new characters better integrated main storyline although without faults overall impression thoroughly enjoyed mostly basis wonderful cast characters however started youll find visuals gameplay elements clearly inferior depending preferences storycharacters may make review less persona persona series whole see best designed rpgs history relatively little time experience due time hoarded things games currently starting second playthrough experience new content lot passion game design anything level design battle mechanics visual design love studying analysing things done done way done effect execution experience game end persona absolutely thrashes every typical turnbased rpg seriesthe best way describe every turnbased jrpg choice beat something keels may myriad status effects spells battle mechanics rarely interact meaningful let alone satisfying way games persona even basic battles reward knowledge strategy every rpg reason even bother spells status effects debuffs dont benefit partys output battle simply serve hinder output enemies times mere goons rarely require result battle system unsatisfying simply stack unrelated mechanics whose real correlation turnbased nature themin persona strategy everything every single thing connection another mechanic way attack defense buffs incredibly valuable even evasion powerful stat buff battle skills status effects like burn shock help increase teams output technical attacks hitting elementaltype weaknesses open shadows strong attacks forth every single move make value almost everything lead chain reaction absolute beatdowns whatever youre fighting point know enemy youre prepared ican lose every single time strategy work way enemies things make difference persona opposed slight conveniences games like damage ability block using one type attack etc etc come inconveniences theres zero reason bother fight actually tests endurancethe stories persona games always incredible well find dialogue bit cheesy take seriously times think events hand incredibly dark theming games absolutely fetish cant get enough good theming stories one thing persona always persona death inevitable need treasure every moment world awful place cant deny need others side help get society cruel doesnt mean cant make difference unfamiliar theyre talked kinda play get whereas youll never really hear people screaming good arethe overworld social mechanics well incredibly interesting social links really something ive ever seen games honestly hard judge make comparison could even better worse dont know havent seen people better worse incredibly fascinating impacts battle system impacts fusing personas sure end day largely progressiongating system sorts like various minixplevel systems time allows grow characters enjoy discover especially valuable persona given theme facing worst everyone around incredibly interesting concept one thats also really without compare idefault ii cant recommend enough persona helped massively expand battle system infinitely satisfying adds even batshit insane

acting characters namely chie people personally prefer previous actress understand much prefer current actress however notable changes lie within personas couldnt choose skills fused persona could inherit got could either pretty good pretty awful however choose skills persona gets fusion far greater customization persona creation meaning unlike previous games initial persona could become absolute powerhouse example izanagi became pure physical monster im still done tweaking throw skill cards get shuffle time lot better original persona going cafe chagall persona skill card icon next name hell lot freedom personas growth may take totally worth want say pixie spell master mind charge megidolaon ridiculoussecond story initially seems lighthearted likes persona actually works games favor underneath lighter exterior theres much darker premise lying wait simplest terms persona golden gigantic murder mystery combined high school slice life whereas persona pretty much unfolding

game also means spoilers please fan shin megami tensei series since smt nocturne featuring dante devil may cry series specifically persona iterations fes portable among one favourite games time original persona though game like wasnt lot stuff game one could argue part immersion living boring countryside town expense players fun massive long gaps would times last month story didnt progress remain stagnant pacing general story final hours path towards true ending game felt rushed poorly fleshed finally soundtrack didnt vibe well persona didnt connect cast much cast issue since one main themes friendship subjective also due gameplay differences two games connection cast development relied hanging outside story cast developed without players intervention felt like individuals independent player end original persona game couldnt stop comparing persona first thoughts whenever mentioned something along lines music isnt good isnt deep duology etc etc never bothered play golden since didnt want buy console play game like atlus finally porting golden outside ps vita easytoaccess platform like pc im grateful allowed see new light new features golden introduces makes miles better original still favourite say personally think golden better golden fixes problem mentioned original simple solution better always true negatives new features making combat easy personally dont mind combat example never strong suit smt games jrpgs general tend always braindead linear buffattackheal games kill mobs strikes lack semblance real thought provoking strategy focusing away negatives golden adds qol changes new events new lines new social links new endings stuff seems minor considering fact im someone didnt like original yet consider golden masterpiece really isnt minor new events bring lot life empty gaps nothing happened story really help connecting getting invested cast nothing important happens theyre silly sliceoflife events addition godsend thematically happy game friendship also ways hang connect cast encouraged makes statistically stronger youre like couldnt connect cast original version youll connect golden new lines also great sometimes bit iffy times obvious new line due quality tone voice acting suddenly taking dip theyre usually far specific character got completely different voice actor voice bit jarring comparison original va first eventually grows quality voice acting top notch path towards true ending also better paced fleshed addition extra month play along new character social link pieces story together makes true ending seem place relation rest game isnt perfect fix decent fix new things golden brings whole patches lot holes feel original better amplifies games themes amplifying enough consider absolute masterpiece game isnt
