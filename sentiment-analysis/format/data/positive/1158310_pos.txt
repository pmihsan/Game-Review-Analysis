holy shit actually good didnt think one favorite games time could incredibly improved really modernized best ways ui graphics overhauls super nice course also things like opening singleplayer games multiplayer switching characters much without even discussing gameplay changes understand peoples issues levy especially boat simplification fan bringing troops together boat system less pain even less realistic biggest issues arent really big notably hooks secrets system seems bit glitchy needs options starting periods definitely biggest desire dlc starting periods im positive coming considering paradox operates overall game makes hundreds dollars dlc look ancient restored roman empire ironman save game almost restore imperial provinces except duchy normandy kingdom england duchies spain tried restore duchies spain game stopped working auto save save file corrupted got hot headed awhile thats fine game amazing really good experience restoring roman empire old border im

greece afterwards got lucky gained province middle east one northern africa somehow turned capturing lands heathens without clothes caucusus ended whole levant caucusus region greece big chunk north africa none connected map creating extreme border gore realized much explore independent ruler leading declare independence pitiful resistance went change everything liking defeating former liege numerous times war kicking already great game editor recently added looking forward play die kids die lose time years retake lands reclaim throne family healthy many wars kids alive happy collapse

absolute masterpiece even whether fan ckii like completely new player enjoy game beware humour get dark game hours completed half game already done everything fun dockiii hours still playing tutorial learnt play good overall recommend game play issues list later update things change gain experience playing game runs smooth constant havent encountered major minor technical glitches map style really good looking art pov game looks great music direction great ui smooth mostly fine feels bit engaged overall clunky boxes nothing gamebreaking like religious systems hook system lifestyle system bit bland would liked see ambitions still part game combat nice overall much clearerbig problems biggest gripe level detail contained game compared whilst counties divided subsequent baronies bishoprics etc bigger playable scale detail reduced despite advertising map much higher detail doesnt translate well gameplay example playing count lancashire possible could start small make moves develop nope play duke mercia controls large portion england option play count less counts overall less opportunities play rise power pov many big named starts map modes get overlooked options main default terrainrealm view really diplomatic map example opinion map reduction detail cb claims cb claims far easy acquire oftentimes could waiting ages fabricate push claim pushed extreme wait timer ping bam also problems random claims coming often eg ireland every chief claim timer gameplay feels almost bit like mobilegame number timers present whether fabricating swaying etc still chance based often feel like im simply waiting clock run character finder nerfed totally whilst reasons make sense terms historical accuracydistance rulers actual interface butchered instead able search people invite court efficient way reliant guests turning court right skills lest council member dies want improve things issue arrange marriage options feels like paradox simply ruined system nothing solid put place hook system feels like lot reductions parts game way shoehorn new intrigue mechanics end feeling tedious essentially thing go character getting want small annoyances selecting character play option reselect date game rules screen without going back main menuloading deleting saves timers decisions seem long less available option save game rule preferencesprofiles change every time start new game ui sometimes annoying going several menus find something want something else click start entirely eg character finder tips following silly reviewwith tutorial king conquered ireland game seems go deeper local culturecustoms stuff instituted old irish succession law united kingdom wouldnt break died law elective tanistry vassals vote member dynasty heir get votes dukes get think votes vassals votethe problem vassals voted distant cousin didnt even know existed nobody lived galloway britain son work take ireland elect little farqwad looking punk tried assassinate failed leader big dumb brute intriguethen decided say screw ill invade galloway take imprison kill courtier county caught crossfireas soon win war character dies stress smug looking prick dominates screen continue heirits fun even begin playing go settings change tool tip lock delay time default seconds feels awkward set secondsthis means hover tooltip x amount time itll lock instead going away move mouse away also set locks hit button like middle button mouse default isnt good consider lowering gui feel like ui like general little big think feels better warned text small vision issues might good change actual game knightschampionsfaris important part court combat default courtiers vassals highest combat prowess fielded knights control however military knights dont want important councilor die forbid fielding knight also use kill annoying courtier cull heirs dont want clicking force meaning theyll fielded takes prowess account likely die especially prowess declaring war war objective changed click conquer duchycountyetc itll default one change target clicking change objective youve clicked declare war type want missed longest time seems like noduh tip forts terrain causing attrition actually really helpful hurtful attrition seems powerful especially close match ups keep eye youve got area seems natural path attack foes consider building manatarms match ups insanely powerful youve got counter units swing way numbers keep eye holdings boost manatarms well even puny light footmen basically suck throw huge wrench effectiveness heavy infantry youre fighting someone uses hire immediately ill keep updating come across inbreeding simulator best game better graphics improved ai edit hours less fixed combat definitely recommend game good stuffcombat used fun patch changed previously allied forces wouldnt help battles generally took initiative capture castles apparently complaints would lead situations couldnt easily attack army outnumbered main force even tens thousands allied troops area however much worse allied units follow around generally hang back youre lucky might seize nearby castle time trail behind getting fight youve already lost allied units follow far behind time engage enemy theyll wait battle completed youve lost theyll throw enemy win lose forces occasionally dont seem know walking back forth cities though theyre glitching hours hours

hours god help theres ruler designer another decent addition series less well polished like family dynasty tree enough give pass another example paradox game learned lesson imperator rome tried make game little different play realize another empty game border gore provinces scattered map seen exclaves france paradox still didnt solve religions get change rules cultural innovations doesnt make

hours understand convoluted mechanics im happy report exception preferencethere bisb learning curve first hours much newbie friendly get time around clicks youll hooked stop playing wake early morning im excited sink many hours game coming weekend time play ive grown older video games generally dont keep attention like used game exception tons fun would recommend anyone vet hours registered ive gone lofty expectations look sequel expectations met thats ok ive kept open mind still remember met hefty dose cynicism dogged heels release months least hearts iron vast improvement loved changes day one people quick call dumbed streamlined mainstream mess really wasnt made game accessible fun play importantly improved upon third installment multitude waysnow comes crusader kings sadly cant say everything dire though hallmark ck series always characters vastly improvedi love character models something kinda worried previously looked jerky odd previews look fantastic variant styles looks female characters well look abit samey work needs done male characters seem gotten attention however much immersive dealing models get attached recognize certain characters visually rather recognizing name roleplaying perspective immersive one scores top pointsthe interface received major overhaul definitely lovehate deal although im somewhere middle like areas im still immensely frustrated certain aspects one example death popup alert get popup alerting characters death maybe friend council member window pops simply tells character died thats big window name mention died want find died manner death quite important ck know game schemes rampant murder find gotta click character link popup hover mouse tiny tiny little hardtosee skull icon next name find died surely information could present popup moment come across multiple annoyances like thisthis prevalent issue present certain notifications schemes mainly newcomers understand frustration issues still popping third iteration game hear people say interface clean great intuitive well certainly clean intuitive newcomers certainly still plagued problems ironed multiple window navigation remains problem im confident fixedonto ai well nothing good say cant speak intercharacter interactions yet ai handles ive seen far army ai war atrocious compared isnt area im worried fully expect improvements ai patches one till get level satisfactory disappointing ai much worse since attachment system attach army ally heavily reliant ally ai making good decisions war unfortunately ai loves loves go fights possibly cant win outnumbered sometimes move without singular purpose coherent structure ai isnt amazing allies least useful provided used attach system lacking really see flaws come ultimately disappointing ai actually worse previous game series paradox youre spreading far many projects starting showif new ck series want much accessible game newcomers enjoy vets though series spot problems many frustrations yet fixed isnt certainly isnt bad imperator fairly bareboned game justifiably got thrashed launch isnt third iteration hoped finally content didnt go thinking would dlc ha didnt expect much cut even minor things cant ask liege appoint council even though im friends one powerful vassals cant make half decisions im used feels like im sitting around time far less despite greater level immersion characters much content missing would surprised paradox invest much time reincorporating without resorting selling bits pieces dlc ruler designer confirmed flc yay small small token compared everything else treasuries nope great works nope greater council interaction nope regency nope although suspect paradox took regencies reason cant play republics make fun hope case regencies real purpose could go places thisit also disappointing play byzantines favourite thing play flavor theyve received dlc attention present pretty much play bogstandard feudal system something im expecting pay later roadparadox gone record state plan follow dlc plan game like ea sims meaning reselling dlc content present prior game severe doubts fully expect paying cleverly disguised dlc future contains content past iterations much missing simply including flc patches investment cant picture paradox doingwith said improves areas stepback series lot ways hope suspect may revisit review give recommendation

sometimes lose physician soon joined wait pretty much whole duration without one hoping nobody family got sick ability sometimes doesnt even get someone good ill sometimes get two people learning stuck try get someone better wanted force use ability reduced cool court physician dies cool gets reset prevent people abusing system somehow b boats bthey removed boats reason anybody get water without needing anything near even land locked country without major river lake next border still get ocean embarking disembarking takes forever making hard run enemy get cornered raiding also removed connections rivers found prevent going scandinavia going byzantium could added small navel warfare something else really liked boats limited options attack distant lands islands b raiding bthere boat drop loot anymore isnt much reason raid rich neighbors stay long impossible raid anyone far even reason barley carry money much micro involved risk losing money raided difficulty getting away ai love chasing super far generally stopping leave territory large nation randomly small raid tend get one two places flee cant risk giving money spent time afraid army wiped leaving open war armies barley carry loot even spend much risk raid weak nations much time little money b governments bthere two different governments play tribal feudal played tribal much havent noticed much difference hope theyll add new government types doubt itll free differences dlc b like bthe new skill tree system feels good makes able rp character better perks significantly better others need balancing give options thingsthe men arms lets customize army better adds depth chose reaserch tree culture groups seems like good inclusion however never played singal game long enough notice much difference cant worse number increase occasional building unlock b overall dislikes bthis game feels like paradox tried new things one usual halfbaked games patch dlc years free recommend playing buying dlc think affect game dont plan playing game much solo like dont havent played yet friends play said games addition stellaris think lot problems things wont change ill buy fix doubt theyll able renew love raiding cant really add boats said wanted raiding risky think risky dont know governments look like future thatll probably change think dumb released boats could thought better instead completely removing sack ai stupid use properly ai still dumb enough feels weird wanted remove addition rp game somehow peasants landlocked country carry entire navy halfway across africa boat england makes sense dont get gone past testingb last bit bi made review couple month since last play session went see changed court system land locked countries boats opinions raiding may wrong doubt like biggest problem removal boats

unacceptable effort tone game make casual desparate effort try attract mythical wider audience mention seems like perfect opportunity throw cashgrab row men row dlc armies longer commanders one flank instead overall massive disappointment terrible experience stick vastly superior game compared piece garbage someone hours think good cause say predecessor far better launch imperator thats sure enough base gameplay mechanics keep playing challenging different runs hours new features get intuitive small tooltip reminders alerts help settle especially well really unless youve never played ck game id say skip tutorial dive count somewhere taken better concepts pieces gameplay later dlcs missing lot early mid releases content moment understandable given dlc selling points paradox goes hope better though rereleases republics horse lords etc receive kind serious treatment later ones tldr found married brother married sister woods blackmailed genius handsome herculean son ousted sonafter

predecessors due ais tendency ally powerful states variety religions doctrines topnotch music fitting immersive much better time seduce pope homosexual king compared imperator game better feels actually good launch compared paradox games played release one far best new character portraits great far detailed old system ruler designer straight upgrade real gripe mechanics arent present playable merchant republics artifacts system compared previous paradox titles game potential also content filled decently playable lesser bugs compared previous titles compared rather different better way lot things consider played find feels lot different ui mechanics however main concepts major things implemented good instead empty gamei really hope paradox learned lessons instead posting barely polished games like rome focus decently finished game polish details hope less dlcs content instead spamming lots little ones day perspective easily hope add details bugfixes time compared vanilla drastic improvement paradox stated ruler designer released free update im sure expect plenty dlc years come playable governments eliminated guess paradox planningthe learning curve less steep new

paradox rely games rely much essentially becomes game blobbing expanding everywhere especially seen atrocious bordergore occurs also means meaningful gameplay outside constant blobbing indeed war time bad gameplay need get land makes stronger means take land etc also means huge nations like hre byzantine empire becomes unstoppable blobs expands everywhere without true penalties paradox needs create meaningful peacetime gameplay currently non bmy final verdictb believe game lot potential sure paradox try unlock time dlcs updates currently game stable particularly ambitious large improvement

dlc might become good even better currently lacks stuff pretty sure updates dlc rectified launch two different things game good tutorial much better however mechanics still poorly explainedbut really needs custom character creator badly game great worth buywell done paradox game great worth price despite upcoming dlc important caveat keep mind though rather thinking strategy game like hoi current iteration much vassalliege relations rping rulers traits expect less monolithic state experience better playing strategy gamesmy experience far rather small realms id guess managing larger realm going lot work instead simply map paintinggranting viceroyalties besides lot modularity base game much interested mods going getas addendum super happy religionheresy changes really great stuff game great far compared crusader kings ii would say game easier use newer players get tutorial worlds playing count duke king emperor building kingdomempire game one game mode really play dynasty dies play end

without game stuttering every seconds plus monthly saves actually doable instead playing minutes waiting save complete another minutes theyve packed lot new skill trees neat gives sense progress characters think lacking previous game much character development random whereas feel like guide kings queens efficiently add ruler editor enhanced genetics feel like im actively building ruling family get attached dynasty trees legacies flesh nicely cultures new religion panel system neat little change cant say miss old technology system even hundreds hours cant say fully understood old tech system cultural system still seems bit odd real modifier highlearning ruler least preferred ruler play style result always lag behind tech department like somewhat forces development whole map line also pretty big detriment certain play styles real benefit balance think part needs work maybe adding cultural focuses change advances cultural tech eg culture idolises war ruler high martial advance cultural developments instead learning especially concerning war buildings troop advancementsthere areas dire need improvement theres excuse horrible ai crusades awful saying something given name game allies actively spread take everything objective theyll stake holding men right next enemy stack wipes army gotten bit better patches still actively avoid joining crusades unless know singlehandedly win dlcs flesh lot missing bits ive come complete version vanilla events well vanilla hope one first dlc bring implements societies huge part gameplay currently closest thing scratches itch witch playthrough isnt cutting overall good game great game serious potential favourite years come paradox took good game stripped bulky confusing polished timesink thats fun play solo friends learning curve still bit steep much relaxed pretty boot plus runs super efficiently even old rig like mine much love game cant wait dlcs although bank account probably cantldr simpler easier pick still firmly

middle ages also recommend crusader kings since also fantastic game played tutorial hours coz didnt know stopspent another hours second playthrough got empireonly realized games weeks already clocked

crusader kings always felt overwhelmed ui lack decent tutorials game seems kept depth second making easier pick right away feel like decent grasp things work like idea game put complexity old one highly recommend give one shot fairly straight forward tutorial great foundation build rest experience really hate autotransport system understand naval system flawed even single coastal province basically go wherever want gives anyone coastal province unlimited vectors attack smells like naval dlc brewing upironically made first crusade christian ruler play rather terribly bunch small allied levies chaotically gunning straight coast isreal ship landing different times right next jerusalem proceeding get wiped one one muslim armies understand ai pretty much incapable anything much complicated really best alternative still fun though thats one thing really bothers play honest feel kind bare spots think paradox launch ptsd huge step abysmal release imperator really like crusader kings great expectations gameparadox devs thanks consistently supporting linux really like tried get found confusing interface interactions seem much easier version really like highly reccomend really like ckii really like direction paradox taken title im interested see sort additions make really like new changes far really like game dont fail spectacularly love charachterisation charachters like first charachter went big brain boy inspired entire generation lowly count migthy duke witch descendants made kingdom witch endures combined migth ennemies outside course inside really like game

realism immersion world battles war mechanics lot interesting really feels like youre trying play character youre given game play type traits character stress system allows feel effects character reacts events world well actions take may agree fun game honestly feel bad see characters die since really feels like im properly playing instead statblock virtually static portraitrandomized events magically change personality hope release new dlc content wonderful start game really like gamelike paradox game itll probably different entirely better year two due dlc updates still lot fun really like paradox done gamemost good features crusader kings already missing features like quite hard direct allies warsthe character creator added also really fun play withthere also pretty good mods

controlling character creating empire love win game plays kind like sims control medieval era ruler exciting engaging love real time strategy games crusader kings really really good overall stuff happens game feels like much funthe game still bugs though really takes example find war small earldom cant raise armies land occupied someone else war goal realm occupied someone else vassals also war feel like enemy cant raise armies enemys lands war goal occupied someone else ai accept white peace instead wait realms work wars really love way masterpiece imperator rome afraid would game good better need little bit content simplified lot previous content great successor crusader kings future dlcs see game masterpiece wellif played see reason buy game ui completely different hours game play notice nothing really changed seems much random events buffers affect character traits housesdynasties military organization completely different reworked hours consider better find new challenges new

minutes play would give really want love game dont feel like playing anymore weeks game looks great things like better theres feeling emptiness ive played two long games one starting reunified charlemagnes empire one william conqueror captured england unified britannia really nothing needed go fight people elsewhere map theres real compelling reason creating work keep researching tech upgrading personal holdings dont really need dont ever get declared war normal difficulty uprisings vassals handled pretty easily gold swaying especially take right perks ive able get kings live late eighties taking medicine personal focuses dont worry empire breaking disinherit sons except one real cost crusades far usually fast lacking something much prefer mission system theyve built least suggests things fun try accomplish really want recommend fan series long time however cant right game lacks flavor choices stripped bone come close ingame mechanics knowing paradox theyll probably add dlc really wanted love game gave good go end ill pass like complexity bit ridiculous theres many variables barely possible keep minimum control think sort understand get forward grow little thing

cheated brother within ten minutes new mechanics like proper feudalism cool polished graphics great lot variety including traits perks even affecting characters posebut samey honestly give recommend disappointment hype train doesnt help wanted play moment got pc disappointment great part wanted start first campaign simple focus creating perfect utopian kingdom perfect genetically bred ruler began journey eugenics sought potential partner ruler desirable genetics eventually found one started pumping potential heirs kingdom one genetics looking appearedafter succeeded plan getting desired heir realize late consequences actions chosen heir last line due current succession lack foresight deal rulers children heavy heart committed one greatest crimes future kingdomi started game dreams utopian kingdom good honest intentions becoming corrupted ruler slowly becoming depraved wanted wait enough hours close trying draw conclusions think thats important paradox games generally extremely complex takes time really appreciate understand mechanics ultimately decided give game negative review case decision particularly difficult actually good game unfortunately isnt good predecessor know people would prefer judge game merits isnt really fair accurate builds attempts improve review needs consider whether paradox accomplished goal view notso get right lot things game runs amazingly well close hours play never encountered single crash hesitation stutter anything else resembling technical problem bug noticed wellreported situation levies sometimes fail fill completely im sure paradox fix one minor balance issues gifts raise opinion cost two three years worth income small realm none things gamebreaking certainly arent surprising newly released game also like improvements intrigue system dozens plots existence point time chance success would stay effect decades intended victim eventually died old age graphics game look great map looks nice people look like real people particularly barbershop tool lets customize characters appearance like fact press anyones claim dont landed first always struck odd someone vassal could make vassal paradox go wrong word depth game looks good surface longer play realize something missing got handle new mechanics soon began feel like playing game lite examplesthe real purpose served council give people reason negative modifier long members least opinion really dont care often needed use favors get council members support law changes even go war members basically love dumb game historically realisticin expanding usually meant finding people claims could press targeted counties expansion usually goal establishing duchieskingdomsempires found people claims counties tried entice court could press claims spend ridiculous amount prestige invite random claimants court eventually random claimants claims random counties show people generally claims counties hundred miles border middle another realm absolutely strategic interest hours game realize doesnt really matter easy forge claims really dont need claimants allthe intrigue system sounds good surface realize aside assassination revolves mostly around hooks problem hooks essentially worthless hours play ive probably used example find one knights cannibal arrest fiend head right uh cant reveal know blackmail hook unlanded character money power exactly supposed hook example find wife affair heir throne probably isnt really heir common would surprised child realm living biological father time arrest appeal pope divorce right yep blackmail supposed hook force serve breakfast bedthere many issues ive already made long point almost everything game dumbeddown simplified point longer interesting challenging im big paradox fan spent far life playing games would like admit missed mark one dont think bit complex probably enjoy enjoy suggest continue playing gets little work eventually huge fan crusader kings took several years overcome learning curve fully understand comparison third entry polished approachable paradox game yet highly recommended big fan ckii put lot hours base game along agot mod feel like game much good sequel could hoped ive read reports team given various mod teams access dev kit plan continuing update game expect game continue improve honestly could well raised subsequent dlcupdates big fan ckii eagerly awaiting ckiii usually dont preorder games one say im disappointed im around hours thoroughly enjoying game havent noticed glaring bugs crashes etc like graphic upgrades see several complaints new ui doesnt bother game play addicting ckii enjoy style game definitely recommend big fan game took everything loved game improved still bit desired ai big step across board times game feels bit samey esp play earliest start finish date likely get better game develops time best grand strategy released opinion bit late like started play year ago however still good enough get hooked try learn total new experience easy get interface beautiful look much drama going already base game really complete experience like grand strategy games fence getting well totally recommend still hardcore player probably gonna get updated visuals amazing bought royal edition right bat cause knew would playing years comei see could problem veterans content coming one base game already amazing excellent showing newcomers play

kings crusader kings disappoint new ui character models look fantastic im loving new stress hook game play mechanics fan crusader kings crusader kings must buy huge fan crusader kings ii extremely excited game dissapointed dlc things missions like council laws societies lot unique governments found outside western europe however really expanded religious mechanics point kind ridiculous sinful virtuous traits character focuses super expanded depending characters stats develop lifestyle experience type stat chose example ruler high military stat get military life experience faster use experience buy traits respective stat thats focus allows characters feel much personalized acquiring traits modifiers felt pretty random dread really cool mechanic intimidate vassals committing dreadful acts like torturing executing people etc stops factions forming bonuses visually game great character portraits animated extremely unique character running well overall think worth getting enjoyed huge fan crusader kings ii one favorite time games crusader kings iii game always wanted little bit learning curve way new ui get hang pretty quick characters actually exhibiting traits awesome lack depth ckii countless expansions downloads isnt blank slate plenty things keep getting stale id wholly recommend game worth purchase huge fan prior game series one delivers much enjoyed last one streamlining improving many elements triumph paradox glad able play able start sex cult best friend age able unite ireland one united kingdom family crest ireland safe prospered although king rule bit iron fist died old disgruntled vassals backed younger half brother rightful heir years deposed king crown son licking wounds planning retake rightful throneall stories aside game amazing played crusader kings ii lot harder get one tutorial paradox game decent great teaches need play leave positive review game crashed ironman save second half century right found first empire save

gameplay found couldnt true easily addicted game ive ages fabricating claims strengthening bloodline murdering rivals things imagine head would even someone familiar paradox games lot youtube video watching understand ins outs id say took around hours feel really comfortable gameplay avid fan quite possibly one time favorite games dying new version gameand got find new interface really difficult navigate half time feel though single thing staring screen waiting something pop working military find impossible whole thing confusing unenjoyable enjoying game tribal ruler character inherited domain full feudal holdings cant upgrade construct new buildings effectively ruining current ironman playthrough thats tip iceberg comes number bugsi dont see ever going back also cant recommend game good conscience theyve patched issues thinking buying right would probably wait couple weeks enthralled game awhile hours massively inflated left game running long stretches end cant really recommend lets downthe interactions use shallow many interaction options without large point investments worth get twothe fighting army mechanics shallow war territory peace mechanics terriblethe economy also broken grow massive empire never really gain large influxes money armies good strategies fix realization minor kingdom gameplay massive empire disheartening game worth yea sure exterior flavors wear

deep never intrigue guy make irresistible military side bit lacking base game really solid flawless foundation worth every penny cannot wait see come addons im changing original recommendation avoiding game recommend ok playing game feels barebones compared lot features didnt make game launch lot new features game surprising amount depth content say surprising paradox game launch still features need fleshed others desperately needed game still feels bit empty instances makes game feel like quite bit content cut release version great successor quite lot features feel like hadtldr feels bit barebones great depth content still feels like needs content areas great game nonetheless im completely new type game thought would great title get learn bough royal edition right bat dont regret base game already much new player everything still confusing damn trying learn still addicting even better playing friends small amount hours series compared thousands see lose days life easily im sure compares paradox games im glad impulse decision payed royal edition comes dlcexpansion pass cant wait ive done multiple savesloads restart friends eventually satisfied one completely lost track time element randomness game great allows new feeling avoids repetitive nature youre like idea youre getting vet fence id say game definitely worth full price dlc heard dlc usually important games great time killer pandemic im enjoying game expanding realm dynasty amid crazy scheming courts military combat system frustrating since npc armies tend zigzag around obvious reason allies often turn away leave hosed could join secure victory also nice game covers quite bit asia africa change scenery bit im enjoying game lot also falls victim issues paradox strategy games players get sync sometimes game either slows lot simply boots players thats still improvement first couple days multiplayer almost completely unplayable people due poor connections servers top game progresses slower gets removal baronies real factor game simplifies things also removes players ability start baron bit bummer people like climb ranks information characters available lock ruler creator really shouldve game launchultimately great strategy game paradox hasnt resolved complaints theyve gotten time time im enjoying much ever enjoyed crusader kings feels much intuitive flows much naturally havent even finished first game yet tell im going enjoy playing long time im enjoying ive seen far good solid baseline feel improves ways cant wait see history wrecking dlc comes future im fairly new types games

hundreds dlc soon im going go ahead recommend game ive real fun playing far god ai trash youll fight allies county adjacent battle theyll stand help wars far fun painful frustrating need make patch allow control allies least ability merge ally armies otherwise allies hit miss sometimes ai allies save skin times question youre playing game horrendous ai im going put dont recommend full price going keep short simply thoughcompared find game isnt fun lacking lot content albeit added added successive dlc many years seems simplified somewhat opinion ends rail roading strategy bit takes away optionsanother thing would add would prefer could customize character game creation would impart sense ownership give initial control development character new content relies certain character traits giving bonuses based traits serves massive disincentive isnt way want develop character paradox said coming sure along whole bunch dlc time moneyin short find simplified less fun less strategic version hence going recommend stage play microsoft platform month suss would recommendation one wish followed prior purchase im gonna go right bat say game probably appeals players completely new crusader kingsthe older games clunky overcomplicated littered bugsa lot reviews say lacks many integral features hadi say however game lacks nuance makes sturdiness design far comprehensive interactionsif play ck roleplaying strategy game better choice farsimpler easier understand generally performs quite superbly im wonderful time generating massive dynasty plopping kids everywhere learning curve bit steep like paradox grand strategy games similar enough able figure stuff pretty quickly number features gated behind techs dont unlocked yet dont worry yet im impressed little missed eight years expansions almost hours played far theres room improve feat distilling best aspects previous game removing improving frustrating ones makes game immersive experience fantastic far future promising im impressed visuals wasnt expecting look good improved many base mechanics many features part dlcs theyve updated game free ruler designer used paid dlc game looks like lot replayability like predecessor even add shattered world update future im scratching surface crusader kings like lot fun seems better polished every way ways much fleshed intrigue stuff especially pretty important game like thisi feel like know characters court used think terms traits personalities rather raw numbers instance cant tell offhand marshals martial score know hes badass battle treacherous jackass otherwise also best friend hope dont end kill himwith hours belt still havent seen much new stuff except many previews developer diaries apparent well thought continuation crusader kings like theres reason fence one im mostly new paradox games theyve always looked incredibly dry presentation impenetrable complexity game changes around almost completely presentation really slick ui map character models easily best ive ever seen strategy title genetic inheritance aging really well done many unique faces come across look believably humanto sure game still pretty complex title succession tangled webs feudal hierarchies easy wrap brain around game good job making important information accessiblethere things bother relatively minor grand scheme things undoubtedly addressed either officially mods one thing marriage makes easy get everything want every child sibling translates powerful ally always help dont wars fight theres little penalty joining wars return top fill court random unmarried women matrilineally marry get best knights world course talented yearold warrior travel halfway across europe join court marry yearold leper found street corner mean wouldnt hethe combat ai could also better usually hellbent besieging capital even terrible idea seems get light footmen time making easy counter archers makes every unit type except siege largely irrelevant way upgrades stack unit types also makes bad idea diversify finally suffer steamroller issues present strategy games stripes get stable kingdom together start upgrading everything game gets incredibly easy im less hundred years kingdom sicily campaign already largest army world bigger hre seljuks even though barely control territory historical kingdom everybody realm seems like havent faced serious threats years peasants rise occasionally die seconds later succession one thing shake things theres lot options managing weirdly difficulty options normal im new crusader kings world absolutely enjoy

countys benefits another frequency pillages raids technology becomes available everyone grandmother takes torch raids nearest town done seemingly without repercussions unless army prevent aggressors unless decisive trounce fend land youre faced least knights marshals falling like fliesas avid fan outsider looking ck series knew game supposed rooted character development versus entirety nation though well essentially cant say find character development deep interesting schemes go far diplomatic measures nations extremely limited without certain family trees marry kid kid get alliance make sure kids kids fill court perhaps murder kin take hisher title onhowever im still novice looking different ways play well watching gamers play perhaps ill learn bit paradox may add features notoriously unpolished releasesall said game moments cant give thumbs truly know bit events mechanics im pleasantly surprised shell expecting paradox succeeded reproducing lot best qualities crusader kings without dumbing gameplay addition knights major plus heard stress going major game mechanic feared work way annoying killer little control fortunately way implemented makes much sense beautiful graphics music also enhance overall experience love addition dread finally behave like real medieval monarch without provoking constant rebellions vassals however maybe bit op moment downsides unrealistic cultural diversity ahistorical weirdness hilarious byzantines losing constantinople making dublin new capital adultery incest gone wild every single one wives even chaste ones many heretic religions though cool create hopefully paradox fix problems modders already done overall good first look surely turn another great one paradox im really enjoying game far love flexibility religion system bat skeptical portraits look really nice hope modders interact well think succession system little weird restrictive hope theres nuance future disinherit cost dynasty head makes lack options

making heir law superiority play without worry much game wasnt bad ended got faction everyone hated son killed one family sinning traits jorvik super weird said easy started sure bands died became easy target reason none levies would reinforce maximum amount probably due land catholic tried fix would take years convert capital starting nordic religion isnt reformed confusing still recommend game still extremely fun im good time learning im excited character designer pdx games always needed dlc become relaxed simple game ill wait ive got rather novice amount hours hrs love way feels fleshed little random event chains spice game much heard releasing got excited excited way map looked graphics possible new features pre ordered downloaded release day initially pleased barbershop

consolidate power gamescheming conquering arranging marriages sorry children werent player heir met untimely end result unfortunate accidents amazing amazing alright game good even base content bnegativesb music pretty dull really nothing add immersion invading large swathes land better technology tied cultures regardless countieskingdomsempires probably one stupidest design decisions made one teh great things could actually invest kingdom using gold build technology buildings develop character high learning skill use spy master steal tech points less control either passively wait use one subjects add development county ill add like theyve added development game think restricting technology cultures really bad inflexible thing doi personally think county county basis like men arms arbitrarily limited men arms capacity primarily based actually afford could also implement feature state blacksmiths types infrastructure need constructed maintained allow standardised armour weapons could unlocked techs allowed earlier certain empires eg byzantines standardised armies compared western counterparts features could added support logistics etc include sliders improve capacity certain things armourweapon maintenance fortification maintenance logistics patrols etc give us control domain feel like laws lacking game compared would nice fleshed feel byzantines especially need separate feudal kingdoms west pretty different system considering remnants roman empire immortal event come way events needed heck could even copy paste starting point really reason use add new ones along dont like small amount construction slots give us construction slots even buildings choose perhaps add county population tie population also influence many levies pop keep going war taking huge losses drag economy decades etc would really help add depth game add bit grand strategy game cant collect treasures join societies like fun added bit depth game bring back improve dont cut creating subject kingdoms isnt thing game far see quite enjoyed setting tributaries nonincorporated subjects bpositive featuresb men arms system pretty nice like raise professional soldiers similar feature like theyve done control designing professional army dynasty attributes great addition ive set eugenics program get really good heirs related note would good future fleshed eugenics side feel actually quite significant part game considering character make break game religion system slight improvement added talent tree huge improvement character development overall decent game missing lot stuff enjoyed hopefully updates come bring quality higher bscore base game b amazing game like strategy politics aspects grand strategies combat complicated seems game explains everything fairly well amazingly satisfying feeling slowly keep building realm especially start small starting powerful dynasties nothing feels like great accomplishment awesome game lot hours price easy game start small scale

great way say early crusades still strong also easy put dynasty throne ive gone crusades top contributer one secondthe new systems renown fame faith pretty awesome havent gotten around making faith incredibly detailed much holy fury reformation system cant wait try good enough game recommend due numerous flaws issues ive decided hold playing longer least first dlc released everything buggyas example spend huge amount time wars various reasons dont stand chance even easy win allied armies often sit frozen spot directly adjacent enemy armies could easily eradicate get stuck flipflopping two different moves get stuck endless cycle faction war every time beat instantly pops end war zero targets besiege enemy armies never possibly win things like hugely problematic similar issues lines succession changing percievable reasons flipflopping heirs narratives repeat endlessly nothing like getting new dog every months reason forth made mistake transitioning tribal feudal turns wipes literally everything youve achieved point rendering game totally unplayable point forwardsthe core premise entertaining roleplaying aspect maintaining lineage titles great mess moment kind fun sure

accounted arrive ally keep moving little enemy settlements siege attacker goes main city wins war wellll although know could command ally army would nice war table sorts decide best strategy defense attack happens called ally even come oftens happens despite confirmed coming another use war table would long wars could deliberate orders minor divisions army like siege town enconter enemy army larger run idk let know decide hoping publishers see dsorry bad english best wishes nice king conquer lands foes overly buggy paradox development studio brings sequel one popular strategy games ever made new king historical strategy igncrusader kings game year vg crusader kings pc gamer title complex title quite nice well polished seems getting active attention worth buy imo cool thats alright bad successor ive got something like hrs bugs mainly inconsistent tooltips etc prestige hate crashing game reason overall smooth plays pretty well ui takes getting used thats paradox yougameplaywise bloody difficult without real stroke luck typical ironman game starting count level see absolutely decimated within years stronger neighbours virtually impossible deal goldprestigepiety accrues slowly almost forget theyre little easier finesse social interaction feel especially capabilities game limited us straight yesno decisions straightforward things like trying negotiate betrothal bit disappointing also acceptance scores negotiate pants someone released prison cant convince friendly allied count accept betrothal kids come whats point charismatic negotiator im still limited automatically generated acceptance scores way underdeveloped peace negotiations compared something like ive conquered every province character owns imprisoned damn straight im going want take county declared prestige bump barely covers cost declaring first placethere features wish could hype baronies serve practical function game tell cant raid cant give except special circumstances middle ages

actually enjoy series tutorial great new layout great models characters slowly ageing reacting environments great weird random story chains great except bug sometimes occasionally found completely empty text box character scandalized wife sleeping overall great still dont think perfect game everyone lack real goal mixed depth complexity means people probably arent going love game love complex

fixed learning curb new players paradox games get better time masterpiece going main stay pc cant go back must hard strategy game theres lot things keep track tutorial okay doesent cover much watch couple tutorials youtube get basic idea whats going started get head wrapped around one depth quality games year strategy modles really bring characters life theres lots hundreds hours campaign would honestly say worth evry penny worth itsa good great game lot fun playing far think play long time without getting bored awesome fun way complex maybe take look updates like might underwhelming complexity little hard get good grand strategy game far streamlined make game new player friendly though sacrifices enjoyment veteran crusader kings players lost lot interesting things happened previous title though im confident paradox add features game later date one best paradox even though things add sort like sims pinch regicide infidelity flavor amount political scheming dysfunctional family relationships brutal tragic wars would make likes william shakespear george rr martin blush really great fun whole family idea fun murdering pope joking aside fantastic story generator game take time get know ai actors inhabiting realm try roleplay within world find midst sorts strange tragic sometimes funny events arise naturally crusader kings really lot fun resist urge expand instead play like sims revel petty rivalries try best worst good parent children maybe maybe ignore border dont fight war think youll fun way ive always felt like would incredible king medieval times actually cant even survive king ive played classic paradox games far best launch ever many improvement keeping true grand strategy beautiful masterpiece iz good mang im huge fan crusader kings ii played many years crusader kings iii nice upgrade franchise new graphics amazing ckiii seems much polished ckii several levelshowever die hard fan ckii used mechanics ckii new game seem little jarring times definitely plays differently ckiisuccesion laws changed historically accurate means going stuck worse system gavelkind least four five generations longeragain much historically accurate frustrating old school ckii players used using tricks rush primogeniture succesion safe secure blobbing experienceit take getting used definitely like done far loved ckii art style man new ckiii art really beautiful nice workalso ckiii content ckii ckii like major expansions things get better paradox adds new content expansions next years ive played hours far everything hoped managed keep game complicated also accessible new players much much much better tutorial everything great quality improvement love army spawns one place rather kingdom kept many old game mechanics balanced new ones put place far complaints game havent seen way find many people character killed amazing game highly recommend ive spent entirely much time playing game last weeks today finally broken hold addictive beautifully crafted masterpiece grand strategy havent lost days like since civilization first played whilst reading wikipedia side screen create custom empires religions try play alternative histories amazing paradox blended role playing elements grand strategy brilliant way two campaigns play similarly ive started haesteinn lowly count ridiculous martial skills sometimes able make strategic alliances marrying children end kingdom twenty years times children die midway war crippling alliance structure end landless vagabond amount timehighly recommend jesus christ someone fix ai crusade im begging christian kingdoms sit friendly territory wait lose miracle decide go siege stuff let muslim armies form large groups stay divided tiny armies get crushed like bruh know crusades dont go well catholic kingdoms cmon half time pope sends armies back home reason huge fun need say anyone liked love one ck better incest beautiful paradox game like always better opinion better version one greatest games time could love giant f anyone like sunk way much get amazing good game great game option view wars empire like vasall fights one great game great game dont know else say new crusader kings new features upgraded graphics good far ive enjoying really good game like solid fun impressive grand strategy title minor rpg elements thrown mix around wonderful paradoxs best release yet amazing amazing amazing amazing worthy successor franchise amazing single game since wow back new got hooked like level freedom choice staggering really really good game around great game amazing lacking gameplay additions however gameplay additions doesnt also gameplay parts lacking im sure become much better future updatesdlc etc recent ruler designer update absolutely stellar design much better onei would highly recommend game grand strategy fans addictive bit simplified bit bare bones present confidence even better good expansions already quite improved game many waysits honestly bit easy youre veteran want challenge pretty much manufacture one intentionally putting bad position lots sons controlling succession etc never played probably wont affect first fact youll probably hugely overwhelmed first dozen hours like us first time played ck gamemany things dont like realism wise still present also maybe even example seen tibetan buddhists inherit territory central france king sweden vassals suddenly convert islam byzantine emperor randomly convert coptic marry ethiopian obscure nudist heretical sect called adamites spreading like wildfire amongst european nobility etc understand sort thing much charm game people things like rapidly ruin immersion id like see game options rectify us prefer realistic historically plausible game options greater penalty marriage acceptance vastly different culture groups along vassals becoming much less accepting liege converting new religion would start least crusader kings arent immediately converting islam soon crusade anymoreall said love game highly recommend look forward wasting profane amount life coming years like fun easier learn ck ii good little user friendly ckii much intrigue scheming less inexplicable loss titles inheritance crises still plenty inheritance crises explicable good good good predecessor nice gameplay tweaks bad new allied troops ai cant assign command movement garbage sometimes get stuck moving tiles entire fking war good reviews good second major dlcs features brought incorporated base game anyhow secret societies arent thing yet still absolutely worth good say good better first one everything intuitive graphics improved significantly cant wait dlc great bit lacking features confidence dev teamedit far first big free update seems promising indepth previous edition much enjoyable much easier game learn whilst still portraying complex world medieval europe must many people whether youre strategy game lover history buff enjoy games role playing elements awesome inbred

streamlined somewhat though probably sounds like criticism considering series fundamentally ships gone entity meaning stomping venice get uppity longer massive chore walk boys sea get boatspersonally felt childhood focuses always getting way two specific points needed make choice half dozen kids various ages courtiers wards spend decent amount time paused make sure descendants werent utterly useless streamlined choose kid going focusing dont constantly look education tooltipthere negatives toofirst feel ui noticeably less intuitive developers going overhaul future wouldnt mind focusing removing many submenus possible previous iteration barely inch empty ui ill admit made game feel dense unapproachable completely new player im neck playthroughs say mistake change thatleaning player

explain ins outs game better depth mebut want short summary one gotten play much yet great game many games imprison kids join totally cult nudist religion heck make cult uh mean religion nude viking oh get cat dogyes pet also reduce stress nice gonna play game spending tens hours getting achievements dont really recommend buying game early stage dlcs came first hours might fun play late game completely boredom especially going vh achievements speed fabricating claims converting counties tommy said like usual paradox game feels like husk actually content yes theres loads room content added still feels like ck game theres new stuff feels familiar new great fun proudest fap recommend type game great game like fantasy rp aspect nearly complex entertaining way easier pick inn beginning like paradox games get better time issues even close near bad imperator rome good game release polished unprecedented degree perfect best paradox launch far recommend dont dlc perfect yet already amazing improvement previous version especially events ui quite good ckii expansions yet better ckii without expansions far recommendedcombat worse map modes addedremoved reason hotkeys changed game game seemingly reasonstarting duchy trying grow one pretty interesting ai mass allies cannot attack anything wait powerful vassals undo every single law ever done dislike facealso new ui complicated reasondont buy wait first successful dlc fixes game sure game like playing sure game simply failed capture imagination bought advertising hype thinking would good creating storyline characters would care whatever reasonit never caught methis isnt necessarily knock game per se mean reference im big fan sims another game manage minutia reputed create interesting characters stories kinda follow make one works wonders one much probably matter taste nothing morebut im still going give personal recommendation anyone feels may like sorts games doand thats nogo asking refund sorry without flaws however game fun decent amount content get better worth hype doesnt much difference better looking crappier ui worth increased price order get prettier version less features worth time money lets wait dlcs yet slowly improving better playing mods better game need reimplement features removed old one like map modes message filtering give recommendation notable lack depth many areas still worth getting youve played want refresh might well afford price sales coming note come many many hours playing ckii euiv civ franchisesthis iteration ck brings big revamp ckii expansion better graphics new features fundamental distinction role dynasty legacy plays much better opinion since legacy dynastys characters decisions gives gameplay meaning host new improvements buildings currencieslevel systems character traits interactions also lot green pasture improve game later example character builder plagues secret societies limited actions goals overall id give current release fleshing surely improve greatly note review biased crusader kings ii favorite game release tip iceberg become anyone familiar paradox tell areas game weak exciting fully realized change time various dlcs free updates make even better game must said upon release amazing game interested history roleplaying seeing different personality types basically thing different ways worth least checking nothing better sit relax plot world domination nothing amazing sequel amazing game plus titties nothing compares terms great strategy story telling whether taking seriously strategy game play fun compelling story game exciting fun warned though learning curve steep punishing nothing else sctatches itch like ck nothing like coming home hard day work logging expanding empire making everybody yield army like everything goes wrong son murdered people rebelling wife wont stop screwing brother pour heart army greater destroying built nothing matters blood seed strongoh yes crusade eternal glooooory nothing fun making family inbred giants forcing fight nothing quite like taking europe forming greater anglesey know become king backstabbing otherspros good graphics easy learn yet hard master nice soundtrack many faction play major minor country europe india plot twist best partcons battle soundtrack short get fighting feeling soundtrack ends mood spoiling suggest long battle soundtrack loop battle song battle ends enough events variety event keep recycleoverall game enjoyable devs keep adding free content fix bug good read review please understand never really crusader kings im less first time player series think game may saved paradox interactive knew imperator rome failed got lot backlash game beautiful modern graphics stunning completely historically accurate paradox didnt make way wanted forge path game think mechanics brilliant fun even funny however think traits diplomacy systems bit overly complex still fun though mighty king anyone imprisoned murdered say wish hearts iron manpower units system instead levies organizing men arms said paradox learn mistakes imperator rome made game better hope paradox attempts another rome game take page games book dont really complaints surprisingly realistic albeit bit complicated medieval simulator recommend logged hours playing game think provide fair review new crusader kings never played precursors biased whatever gaming experience like general challenging game issues much micromanagement want big court many benefits marry heirs form alliances attract councilors excellent attributes etc etc micromanagement thousand cuts constantly checking see married isnt assigned guardian educator hasnt doesnt game allow option automatically identifying unmarried characters court children educated make things easy stupid game complex cant even figure rules around key aspects game many examples transferring titles game say least totally nonunderstandable unless want study rules hours watch various videos done still doesnt totally make sense especially new bits constantly come vassal vassal leave kingdom take titles stupid frankly would say impossible another example really crazy design nowhere game helps youtube videos chat boards anyone figure retain dynasty head position heard power number titles etc etc nobody knows hilarious major mechanic game completely unexplained game nobody figure lost standing dynasty head explanation found works warfare joke supposed mimic real warfare middle ages like stupid basically create two armies three whatever put trebuchets catapults one army siege castles army chase enemy around map corner crazy nobody fought wars like basically strategy whether win commander best traits forget paying mercenaries required frankly bugs game immensely buggy however game complex nobody really figure something broken cant even tell supposed work believe simple things like ransoming captives says get gold many times lucky get gold happens time dynasty head thing opinion broken somebody tell micromanagement involved developing domains cant tooltips prompts help player know develop domains currently track manually beginning game big deal maybe one two domains frankly empire grows becomes another example tediumother examples unexplainable trying play game suddenly certain vassals courtiers show screen naked whats suddenly forget get dressed went stroll explanation people show naked sometime honestly game ridiculous think people love game nuts real objective grow dynasty fun watching ice melt micromanagement idea hype relative game simply rinse wash repeat except case get married kids educate stress die lose titles start new heir seriously funi love strategy games ridiculous hours game must say one alltime favorite games realism great soundtrack great game play sound game also looks great graphically highly recommend game person like strategic tactical games firm far im concerned ruler designer come proved great character designer systems amount customisation gives ready say crusader kings pretty much updated better version predacessor always special place heart provides features better graphics customisation focus characters flaws bit annoying times yet features predacessor still great enjoyable experience enjoy roleplaying games highly recommend crusader kings theyre adding character creator qol items like definitely say becoming excellent grand strategy

theres two themalso notsonice experiences trying open mp make nono mebut quite fun actually works obligatory reviews need mixed recommendationas definitely good packed gills dlc still good enough game rightmany features streamlined genre normally dirty word id say largely done successfully theres fine balance depth ease access walks razors edge well enough theres definitely bugs still around well current favorite children getting bugged completely unable assigned guardianthings would hope see improved ui tech system succession laws firstly ui mess many map overlays gone niceneat way view holdings namely baronies makes searching slots upgrade open places build incredibly tedious physically go individual barony map click map horrible seperation lines trying remember buildings wanting put awful system revamp asaptech system directly tied date investing feels like complete waste time modify chance good roll much stuff gated behind dates means literally cant even try get things end game namely best succession lawswhich brings succession forced partition succession game garbage forcing tribal rulers use worst form partition doubly sense succession law accessibility first things modded partition laws simply fun play also buggy mess often shotguns kingdom leaving primary heir king england owns rolls die devon good luck getting rest back brothers whatever reason inherited full dukedomsas long able overlook game still good obviously doesnt insane amounts stuff mods lot better launch ever would recommend pretty much every area tested blast play come memes stay kickass gameplay obviously couple hours game great game enjoying time spent playing obviously game still new looking one pdxs greatest games fond memories far carrying legacy well course still rough edges grind known features missing still think potential even surpass predecessor additionsthe main thing im missing republics trade routes feature really loved best think far easier get first time players improved notifications popup telling whats going even things like vassalize neighbor shit course many people became interested game due fact sleep sisters brothers walk naked emperor liked opportunity become emperor ordinary count lead crusade conquer nearest countries maintaining order current empire achieving various goals easily one entertaining games recent years course best game years come fantastic start significantly lower barrier entry compared easy get ingame encyclopedia system also fantastic dont know pdx games gone far without onemajor improvements areas notably graphics ui diplomaticdynastic interactions fairly limited compared fully expansion packed thats expected think given brand new title havent performance issues game seems place demand gpu would expected type game probably optimisation thing nothing really concerned good start hope keeps getting better often see sequel popular expanded upon game would expect release less content previous entry crusader kings iii defies expectation taking best features previous entry expansions adding base game start get amount content youre used well whole bunch new exciting featureseverything lifestyles indian subcontinent customizable religions randomized starts many features carried addition changes traits work makes characters come alive ruler longer arbitrarily imprison rivals without penalty may risk mental breakdown going sense justiceon user experience side everything seems improvement well ui easy navigate contains plenty tooltips explanations different actions traits terms mean youre doubt theres massive encyclopedia right fingertips help outthis one times ill gladly heartily recommend paradox interactive game launch day oh paradox exploit love history oh boy oh boy game amazingive waiting years years yeah also great plenty things however crusader kings feels like charactercentered game focus mostly playable ruler contrary crusader kings managed achieve slight shift dynastycentered perspective yes youll finally able remember least part court family game constantly gives events least one courtier presentedcharacter portraits dynamic genetics plays bigger role plus know way interesting look different faces poses body proportions portraits also like refined relationships system made game world livelier place finally going around making bunch friends rivals even wife kids concubines random dude thing example one rulers daughters managed befriend half brothers sisters made rivals siblingsmoreover traits characteristics dynamic making everyones personalities well maybe one kind least adds diversity roleplay value plus things stress dread parameters contribute overall experiencemy complaint armies seem bit broken especially ai part allies enemies forces sometimes dont want help battles even though united army way stronger opponents also sometimes ai route logic gets broken allysenemys army stuck thinking whether embark noteven though game certain bugs still great optimization wonderful cpu isnt powerful suggest use however game still works fine gameplay many content initial release else dream well maybe lack glitterhoof upsetting oh dear sweet heavenly godthis great attitude user friendly easy understand easy learn makes roleplaying evil king much fun still murder family members seduce lords wives daughters start bloody religion cause mayhem middle ages cant wait good folks acertain website get work famous mods would always play oh good alright itll get better oh manits awesome bit easier crusader kings still much funi really scetchy getting preorder im glad delivered ejoyable experiencei really like craft dynasty like instead playing premade randomized dynasties working count duke point given playstyle start crafting dynasty want look likehope see new dlc promised preorder especially ones change stuff import stuff maybe oh god thought game one thing something else completely wasted money big time one eventhough dont like maybe others think im spoiled total war series oh eu another game cant stop playing days completely addictive completely genius buy like grand strategy wont get better oh yeah big brain time oh yeah good stuff ok first wanna say played lot paradox games played imperator wait game start prosprosi like legacy system helps maintain dynasty set traitsi like buildings system including duchy buildingsi like limit duchy titles limits vassals helps keep giving kingdom titles early gamei like outremer eventsi like english culture event works comparison like addition areas map makes hopefuli personally like focus combat rpg needs developed furtherconsi think inheritance byzantine empire makes start easyi dont like igta done away perhaps havent played enough yet get helpsi would like see culture events feel something game could better also something found lacking imperator historically gauls merged roman culture making subculture byzantine restoration culture events would intriguing toothe realize harder context game im suggesting events muslim latin origin cultures possibly even franconian root culturei would love see china map game would make playing uyghurs etc interestingchallengingi would love see start like game brings release im eager see goes dlc mods havent tried character designer yet lot like comparison feel resistance certain engines different ive played hours wont able say whether change clan inheritance opposed iqta change experience ok straight stupid decent chance winning actually amazing chance start one allies completely ran enemies ally came one allies decent chance winning ally backed last second committed already died finally started moving war score went ally sent decent sized force wasnt gonna make time lost war game stupid spent time converting entire court astru convert another religion dont loose land cost piety convert back screw really enjoying made coven may struggling bit expanding point power means start expanding soon beg fix game plain stupid ok quick review kind game lost inside hours even know much time past also plenty mod support currently growing add cross play people use xbox game pass mods makes fun way ignore ok heres full verdictassuming know drill come paradox perspective familiar etc awesome immersion awesome graphics awesome mechanics lots fornication first time make good use allies awesome version effort comparable say guns n roses first album looking forward whats coming next minor annnoyances raising armies bit chore raise deraise ones dont need mid late game challenges get army size rest world smoked thats defo start small ransom fees prisoners sometimes dont correspond collect fixed surely religious orders useless pay never get use religious reformations supposed big deal upside adding women recruitment pool imho big waste time effort crusade victory points outbalance win big lose big otherwise crusades compelling max crown authority vassals able battle appearently enemy friendly armies could outlined bit clearertop tip try jarl haesteinn montaigue second start date supposed easy youll find make parallel history invading england brittany stead normandy tough challenge rewarding course iron man go full nerd renaming french places nordic names mythology much better ok followed debugging steps letter still game auto save regularly crashes ireland easy mode system memory beyond exceptional game plenty gigs left saving literally dropped pants far security goes everything shutdown running steam admin unfortunately one person asking refund even though think would enjoy game little time able play repeatedly start one case developer rushed product market prior testing externally shame would also like add negative difficulty finding contacts trouble shooting steam also made sure steam program drive gigs available restarting system approximately times run windows online community support seen issue sure heck cant get touch developers help developers yes run least times file validation via steam found nothing wrong along deleting reinstalling multiple times executables ok im gonna keep short youre strategies new paradox games give least hours fun youre pdx veteran see years finally make game mechanically rich add needed flavor roleplay options ok better ckii hope keep steering ship right ok lets clear far less content expect fully fleshed game must disappoint said fun game nonetheless see lot potential ok played hours hours nowthis certainly mean expert anything like feel know somewhat talking aboutthe review contain ins outs opinion wether endorse gamealtho lots changed average understanding troubles understanding play played problems heard actual tutorial explaining stuffthe information provided guiis pretty much focussed newcomers seriesoverall say game complete hope get attentionquality got free updates dlcspersonally really enjoy game uninstalled favor game gets upvote ok initial review ill update later drastically change mind later onfirst biggest improvement like game use wasd keys navigate around map small thing wow difference second lot elements streamlined fixed improved game good exampe combat lane bs improving army numbers composition new focus system allows much better control character last gamehowever biggest change game level immersion feel playing playing character need keep mind traits get stressed resulting negative debuffs trait choices also make much larger difference interacting people good example lunatic sin catholic religion results everyone else judging even worse interact tons ways immersion improved favorite part game overall liked like graphically roughly shiner coat paint would probably rate game amazing definitely worth sticker price game okay hours campaigns time brief review hours first impression looks kinda nice guess oh didnt put ships really uh button uh really raise troops like thisby third game though love first two games short refiguring mechanics bit since played want paint map pretty easy experienced easily got empires control third game could gone chasing achievements ill go pros areas improvement arent cons cause know dlc come themtop pros simplicity didnt overcomplicate raising troops put ships game start first upset base game actually done really smooth way grapics could use touching map modes things generally good dont lag game much like afraid talent trees absolutely love crazy strong talents leave figure every tree seems useful things depending play style certainly found ones cater mebiggest room naval combat really must balance raise troops sit someones cities go war certain situations character story seem kind like get disputed heritage trait never select extramaritial affair end game screen end game screen made feel epic good game told bit story feel like lot work could go screen tell story rulers rise fall compare dynasties game okay first time playing series kept seeing popping site time long time civilization fani couldnt help think wouldnt like comparing two finally pulled trigger got whim launch hours addicting hours see mass amount content available cant help feel receive treatment modsmanso many great ones already game well put together cant say ive encountered bugs interface easy use ive read isnt easy navigate new game fixed expect city world building game like civilization wont find find basically medieval politics simulator war slight city improvements depths upon depths political intrigue marry brothers wife marry daughter keep blood lines strong throw son jail plot murder rival many random options game hours ive scratched surface okay crusader kings somewhat breaks trend paradox game releases barebones unfinished fully featured strategy game add dlc later really need flesh little things base game satisfy youi think game slightly casualised coming thats okay really try play like dont get handholding drop menu tells everything works endless tooltips ingame encyclopedia explain anything need know flash issues even people love game think mostly eliminates youre pro heck dunno maybe dont really need game remind fiftieth time go make friends dude dude thats cool turn interface better think time still perfect still struggles show vast quantities data game already struggling show times cant imagine like navigate get around dlc even mods inevitably add menus characters scripted otherwise interact think needs work maybe better scaling options change scale various elements gui parts gui absolutely need compressed worked least display sometimes screen gets cluttered stuff little annoyingfighting better think manatarms system able train units effectively like normal strategy game lot warmongering folks like want able build guys comes type games come rts background first foremost always bugged really get dirt shovel button gives levies thats get hope vassals like organise regiments trained soldiers quality quantity boot good system like constant upkeep means little nations wont really able field vast quantities professional soldiers later youre willing invest enough punch levy weight speak quality units think good systemim like many hours game think comes spending gold difficult tell good investment many different projects want money could save various titles clear really help could save buildings give clear benefits little difficult understand things like gold per tick thats easy get something like light footmen toughness light footmen damage little tougher really get feel part dont really see numbers behind combat theres things like holy orders pilgrimages things still better technology system whatever called fascinations kind weird whoever stands top culture gets decide tech research seemingly random exposure random techs drives along first foremost cant tell whats exactly optimal get like bonus random tech exposure bonus anything choose long youre culture leader system seems okay techs obviously much much better others primogeniture instance simplifies succession may even make game easy whereas others simply give new manatarms unit buff existing ones think fine anywayi didnt spend much seems kind absurd good incest ancestry perks get permanent crazy bonuses succession positive traits maluses continuation negative traits bloodline kind nuts feel like youd pretty frequently get hit inbreeding penalties deformities doesnt seem common game filter bad stuff keep good stuff havent seen yet im pretty sure theres also specific blueblood trait keeping bloodline pure ancestry general bunch various strong perks permanent bonuses various things caught eye capacity make every member lineage better everything thats pretty strongthe graphics general pretty appealing think good job sticking realistic art style one things bugs certain games like civilization sickening drop cartoony caricatures im glad didnt fall trap really much say front since know paradox strategy game theres whole lot going terms models stuff actually least fully character models stand backgrounds stuff cool idea think variations appearance good enough differentiate characters one another time good stuffnot much say sound either guess musics okay mostly good atmospheric stuff theres tune plays time something big happens short like theme crusades long might even like minute music kinda weird finish reading dialogue box press ok still going later youre trying build motte something think sound effects better mentioned earlier dirt shovel sound levies fortunately fixed doesnt sound like youre plant crops backyard whateverits unbelievable tutorial actually works game unlike feel free give try feel necessary make start king murchad munster think beat tutorial game keeps going good one suggestions people reddit offered new players learn game since tutorial nonfunctional hey actually pretty good start feel like game engineered get taste everything get take little bit territory unify small country even specific steps progression greatuhhh could go basically pretty good satisfied many levels direct upgrade opinion okay game ridiculously easy want steamroll map without real difficulty yeah get game otherwise wait harder difficulty releasedalso playing years finally getting end game thing happens screen says end button go back main menu literally thats option look back expanded realm ruler ruler possibility retrospect honestly unsatisfying launch feels bit personal grounded also seems fair realistic became dlc releases diseases much chore get demon spawn assassinate entire family immortal lunatics aztec invasionsplenty refined mechanics like love disinherit disown seduce romance options happy way culture religion conversion give timer tech tree much better set spymaster spy stuff instead steal tech world like way new council jobs works rpg elements make feel attached characters weaker dynasty members still survive awhile careful attention choices like personalize holdings building choices overall happy still nice meta humor like tinder parody stuff interface audio much polished game doesnt take much space runs fine early starts could use balancing though best stategy games ive played really hard understand game hero release game everything made good reworked mechanics used bad new paint graphical coat could easily run whit mid tier pc long youre imaginitive enough set goals playing game worth buy paradox title made exeptional dlc likely come form later first day came played hours straight whole really fun game enjoyed time spent game felt like ai behaves like reasonable simulations individuals exception person wouldnt vote elected king instead preferred idiot uncle whole would give thumbs uplike many paradox games issues clear communication consequences instance ended walking away ireland play enacted tanist elective succession expected keep realm together expense able choose heir nope realm still went kids didnt get groom heir idiot uncle became next line

stories hope future updates dlc include things like bloodlines societies bored playing wait much crusadesso much kingsvery iiii love game respect others genre one masterpiece interesting play manage continue playing throughout day idea play heir death brilliant also game sometimes hard tries behave like real life characters really though sometimes notice pure random luckyi recommend much better ui always felt like fighting ui fighting vassals concentrate fighting vassals much better excellent ckii much easier get found confusing gave hours one however realeased bugs fun gameplay easy understand ui far hrs game played nations played munster tutorial nation good way getting know game especially martial route character able conquer half ireland scottish invaded gave upmy game played leon spain attempted inherit castile gallacia intreague tree however found managed shoot foot making castile strong failing kill family quick enough gave upby failed attempts would normally expect verge giving entirely game instead found enamered trying another game using martial route played southern italy span kings found created kingdoms krete sicily egypt whatever tunisianlybian kingdom near unstoppable elite soldiers vast number levies peasant rebellions troops numbering able destroy expected king died lost kingdoms north africa sicilyoverall game fun brilliant doesnt take long get head around yet still advanced enough keep occupied finding things play gamein comparison paradox games id say easy understand sits place stellaris quicker understand understand thew game becomes simple tho unlike id say fave paradox game least stellaris anyone asks love dont understand im play game xd much easier learn paradox game like much fun much fun game much fun game thrones adventure pretty much sum crusader kings iii love much easy get missing fun extras previous iteration like secret societies etc like starting hundred years earlier allowed lot love always modding community taking everything notch much friendly interface wise tho release missing stuff like china conclaves otherwise addicting plan racking hours much role playing potential best paradox game date hololive empire conquered scandinavia britannia half europe im kinda satisfied first day hour id say overall enjoying find different enough say seperate game still crusader kings find ui liking eye movementclicksspacing etc looks nice times notbut playing another day started feeling really shallow repetative started feeling like eu iv game crusader kings seems less character stuff going mean fact court ends useless awhile hard inter merry get court guys even events character thing assassination attempts killed like guys row text pretty muchi kind got meh lets go something else feeling pop get county isnt much fun past revolts loss titles deaths etc seem absent particularly ai first player died old age son didnt like finally turned around started good stuff added couple lands realm years nice dynasty going nice troops castles angry vassals tried revolt stronger army best marshal actually wasent nice lost time hungary decided claim one land getting next eh life ready counterattack get back lands bubonic plague reached island died son died years later even heir game one thing say ui bit clunky opinion also vassal someone hard really see territory control territory map isnt best also miss able pause game clicking esc button love run high speed arent careful find balls deep war without game stopped fastthis still amazing game probably best paradox game launch ive ever played alot depth game already buy asap pretty good super preliminary thoughts ck couple hours gamethe gameplay buttery smooth compared ck much less jank everything feels logical goals feel easy work towardsthe graphics especially models immersive hell really get invested characters dynasties playing astheres couple weird changes took getting used definitely less depth compared ck dlc overall experience slicker prettier immersive packagethe one bug complaint right achievements pretty slow pop next day deal looks like paradox serious bugs oss deal withoverall enjoyed thrown crusader kings jankiness high barrier entry try crusader kings seamless package provided fun last game already eagerly awaiting next content update take make easier learn pickup new players boom crusader kings iii liked would definitely recommend game side note game looks way better yet plays much better optimized earlier today played game people minimal lag something really wasnt possible minor things removed bothers little minor titles regencies specific one best parts assassinated succeeded year old son uncle ambitious hates nephew run realm ground also improved succession system opinion many situations wont able change succession type something truly favorable makes game difficult usually race see fast could get premogeniture would never touch succession againas someone put hours far would recommend game fun old players new ones alike new series never played game much easier learn however sure yet would recommend going trying buy game free like basically guarantee like game best part game depth npcs army war aspect really sold game honestly great game needs work expected new pdx games looking forward future game review someone played heavily dont expect whole differently new game core structure games ie battles strategy changes say actually feel believe makes game worthy successor listed suchdifferences army structure revamped bit allow say quality army nice touch hooks allows new intrigue options gameplay life style took ambition feature gave depth detail new religion havent gotten feature yet looks dope create religion depth graphics small touch immersive effects character better displays physic traits makes realize messed typhoid isverdict similarities may say vamped youre expecting totally new gameplay might disappointed expect bit game much better immersion cool new stuff worth buy uh women keep joining court naked complaining anything usually mod kind content though lol hours game good paradox style wont great til dlcs inthe goodui much cleaner still trouble getting show region intuitivelyskill trees lifestylethe awesome needs tweakshooks great vassals useless anyone else needs path utility eg spousecombat supermobs still happen crusades point ai army starts starving variation specialization countering unit types siege unit types great needs little tweak giving info rally troopsthe annoyingsome obvious things worked well like personal items societies arent yet sure paid dlc ended addicted pretty addicted days almost surpassed hours alot content added next probably less years would grab content comes little time paradox keep busy almost decade many things pick country play time almost took scandinavia denmark spreading viking religion everywhere first catholic crusade barley made left vikings everywhere still sweden totaly wrecked england goals make astrau one true faith taking pope jihadi making mongols b world domination rule skal set restore roman empire first playthrough italian duke end fun expanding realm actually interactions characters along way make playthrough unique memorablewhen im seducing sister improve relationship getting blackmailed spymaster plotting murder said spymaster whos also uncle one powerful vassals fail rise rebellion thats fun oh also got second attempthowever thats similar enough prettier version well yes actually noof course many similarities core mechanics overarching themes remain features im missing notably ability influence education children collection artefacts treasuresbut time many changes improvements really like beyond neater interface nice modelsthe intrigue system much fleshed lifestyle choose much bigger impact gameplay give abilities really alter gameplay technology system actually matters techs dont give static modifier dont care actually unlock stuff profound impact gameplay least like inheritance laws examplei also really like new stress system encourages take decisions according attributes character events inevitable mental breakdowns hilariousperformance another thing positively surprised game runs smooth threeyearold laptop ram actually faster think almost never used highest speed set game time almost passed fast game get bit slower first hundred years didnt get much worse im pretty sure well hear much less performance stellaris performance constant issue though ill say might better play game higher resolution entire screen plastered messages alerts might actually see bit pretty mapthere still much room either dlcs mods expand upon diplomacy options severely lacking trade almost completely absent playing roman empire byzantium assume feel different feudal king doesnt events also become bit repetitive also qol stuff sorely missing diplomatic map mode said amazing scope release version especially paradox game doesnt feel game okayish become good major patches dlcs years game amazing already get even betterespecially modding community got time work art like best total war game ever released lord rings mod medieval best paradox game ever released game thrones mod probably take year cant wait one even though shudder think sleep cycle game enough damage already ill assume people reading already played least vague picture minds words critique comparison previous gamelets start best part opinion roleplaying enjoy personal bent crusader kings strategy games get rebellion someone steals wife soviet union british empire actual character personality wont get vengeance geopolitical entity person behind thoroughly relieved find aspect lessened previous game onemechanically speaking base game feels quite wholesome paradox first installment dread lets bully vassals adore lifestyle perks knights feel lot better commanders ever feel like stress mechanics overall annoying oh council much much better actually lot councilor option ever feels useless something cannot said council ordersalso first time franchise actually idea hell happening combat admit greatest player makes praise im giving higher paradox made combat simple enough clueless guy like understand granted hardcore player might good thing allnext ui mixed bag far less cluttered previous one probably higher odds knowing available button hand pending issues feel bit awkward people used issue generating new alert top screen however admit got used new ui dont mind half much nowreligion way waaaaay better many branches heresies denominations game feels incredibly complete also apart ludicrous piety costs faith reformation system already tops previous game dlcsfinally ai lets clear absolutely loathed chase enemies armies way tibet could force surrender final defeat fixed theres much less running around lot headbutting always plus feel like alliances bit abused computer feels somewhat preposterous petty conflict ireland draws attention like different european countries cant say spectacle seeing thousands troops disembarking murder minimal conflict amusingmy one complaint far absurd events seem greatly reduced maybe unlucky werewolves possessed people certainly crazed shamans following pagan faiths wandering around stuff like hellenic revival old borrow jewsexpel jews tactic yet either fine detailsi think game quite satisfying release thrilled find paradox implement societies deal religions got less love past zoroastrianism judaism future expansions ive played couple hours far thoroughly enjoying time game stories come game downright hilarious currently building empire inbred abominations ill update review comes inevitable conclusion far recommendation basically liked youre probably going like though hear people initially liked game kind stopped playing sure thats case heres think opinions may varyoverall feels like crusader kings enough keep player interested room improvement found game breaking issues problems ive seen things like tool tip mistakes slight balancing issues areas additional content would help game fairly polished quite stablethe lifestyle perk trees focuses brilliant one best parts game alliances seem important stress mechanic thought going silly big deal provides another rpg aspect game boats maintain im okay game play feels better without mechanic dont really miss themif youve played know might find bit easy least impression hours playing hardest difficulty im sure yet im lucky play early viking tribal get strong ally pick weak countries wait opportune moments like right succession alliances dissolve kingdoms split apart youre going feasta lot doesnt appear difficult go chieftain king one charactergraphically get characters look alive map quite nice menus large think maybe bit much im often moving windows way look another window occurred im writing may setting somewhere ill check next time play interface good though nothing feels place awkward items important keep eye easy find easy find way around learn ui quicklythere still minor bugs dont find bothersome end think solid bugs probably cleaned pretty quickly additional content title could phenomenal yes im aware paradoxs dlc prices suggest waiting buy half dlc releases probably wont worth buying anyway wait bit hear reviews get want goes salestill even without dlc think base game worth buying bought release though dollars less list worth id even say knowing know would paid full price quality game needs tweaking one feels half empty need major work one games release say first

playing blast playing heirs sassanids iran paradox guys good game worthy successor quite excited see planed future game pretty big learning curve like paradox games gives lot tooltips almost everything overall fun experience even frustrating times things happen dont understand yet game thoughtful complex play game easier ui however need improvement since things missing game would greatly

beautifully done historically accurate smooth play grand strategy game need pay attention details learn right get used mechanics boy loads fun ild score game improves much ui depth isnt yet still tons playability highly recommend playing couple friends game easier get previous crusader kings games huge sandbox game encourages different play styles starting lowly count working way emperor feels satisfying seducing wives rival kings plotting kidnap someone dont like never gets old possibilities endlessthe downside far combat ai part runs away combat allies sometimes even try help combat numbers game sure raise menatarm regiments get advantage part kingdom bigger levies always win game good continuation crusader kings series many things improved streamlined however issues one toggle character allowed forbidden leading armies feature removed paradox another console far tell accessible starting game debugmode hassle game pretty great change almost aspects especially tech focus tree however unplayable gamebreaking bugs crashing game plagued multiple saves cannot recommend time edit nevermind fixed game splash fun trying world build building empire also familys dynasty game total

recommend looking comments aswell easy get fun play either way fun marry family game alright stands lot things simplified better worse military aspects made incredibly simple use time also quite tedious convoluted involvement individual characters combat welcome addition one probably could introduced elegantlyfor paradox game dont think game worth asking price worth rebate price right nowget sale preferrably couple major overhauls ones military frameworks revision government framework considering getting get deep discount may scratch itch really great yet game amazing incredibly fun play developers really payed attention history something youll notice play like king england stating special troops historic battle took place genghis khan appearing massive army high quality troops busted casus belli keeps thing realistic game truly excels ability start anyone even count eventually rule whole empire albeit thorugh conquering marrying scheming far favorite run date starting small indian nation lanka eventually creating roman empire lmao also enjoyed run become king jerusalem first crusade queen case long contributed eventually creating outremer empire game definitely unbalanced aspects personally find game easy comes point youre playing know thing stopping conquering casus belli time youll absolutely wipe floor enemy start making gold turn sets menatarms game ai indian run defended crusade jerusalem pope time defending genghis khan back india massive horde menatarms spawn immediately fieldanother aspect thats kindof broken pope crusades even amount troops contributing crusade like unlanded hell still crusade way dismantle papacy unless specific religions changed maybe something along lines catholic counties support papacy crusades last years sometimes let go till war score hits controlling war target makes impossible hold decisions since major ones require war decision make roman empire requires certain amount prestige ruler died waiting crusade end grind prestige back next ruler frustratingthe rebellions another broken aspect thats frustrating know need game realistic purposes wow point theyre annoying anything else outremer run youre catholic ruler next bunch islamic religions every county control revelling every year every goddam year somethiems year youre conquering fast realm huge greek rebels constantinople english rebels london islamic populist rising mecca defending crusade wont end cause cant capture pope game fantastic definitely give go many good aspects make run ruler feel different outremer run begun count aaragun something like created confederation switzerland holy roman empire got elected hre one rulers eventually switched queen jerusalem kept claim hre eventually got back removing princely elective law holding hre outremer empire amazing game definitely try game amazing id like way coat arms dynasty picture randomize like list editor dont spend years looking something game amazing first playthrough realize

seljuk nation middle east friends far away send huge army britain despite logistical costs sanity normandy catholic friends realistically troops must sent distances crusade next example playing irish king holland part holy roman empire declares war take dorset alliance france france disembark whole army troops shores besiege dorset help friends rival holy roman empire unlike first case seljuks much closer war theatre almost similar culture ok want help whole french army get paris besieged looted happened stupid behavior even stupidest rulers world normally ok expect contingent army help improved fixed example closer ally firstly geographically culture religion common interests chances expect go end sending whole army huge army sent middle east britain absurd also want drive attention endless extension great powers byzantine empire holy roman empire looks like molds map digested around id like see stronger separatism movement empires collapses least ai side wish players turn affect

norse faction send entire freaking army across take one single province weird arabs moving entire army soldiers support hre also something happensecond id like grab attention game files namely mods stumbling one another second game didnt problem like almost every mod adds something area instantly makes mod vanish game many modders found annoying problematic really want add anything game player perspective turns adds tiny little detail religion like puff one works ive heard religion like main problem area game worth price provides good gaming experience special type rts enjoy long time game justifies plaudits simply endless amounts fun first crusader kings game steep learning curve got hang couldnt put game incredibly rewarding many ways best part play game however like simply put like strategy games youll love game keeps nearly depth previous game features improved tooltips vastly better ui feels like indie game comparison still tweaks probably need happen befriended liege supported fabricating claim title overall enjoyable experience like improvements combat previous title well game made actually enjoy playing games game made want study history game make throw social life form kingdom ireland love game makes tyranny ingame system makes roleplaying favorite tyrannical dictator enjoyable everalthough features cut game release like ruler designer later implemented

realm dynasties theres lots different ways play dreadful ruler incites fear among vassals courtiers someone uses diplomatic route makes friends people power may look like honestly one best rpgs releasing year dont pay attention everything youve could collapse within gameplay wise lot smoother crusader kings big improvements military easier understand maps uis tutorial actually good overall think good game ive got problems obvious problem crusader kings simply content game fair comparison crusader kings multiple years updates new dlc releases another problem believe way easy expand realm extremely fast crusader kings difficult get claim claim got actually mattered game get claim minutesanyways great game maybe compared crusader kings maybe even game provides innovative new graphics old replayble paradox style game really proven good game could done better predecesoor rly unique approach gameplay made good features even better features little weird reworked removed bad things like hud improven lotpositive sides compared good features remained weird mechanics improved made functional like prestige piety gains stacks secondary resources research little bit unbalanced nice rework lifestyle really helpfull bonuses attributes game stable ironman much less cheatableone negative side approached christianity early years rly unstable random bishops giving huge ferovr around balance issues believe could resolved next patches game requires beefy pc run smoothly youre playing laptop like would recommend monthly autosaves general careful game expect frequent crashes said game already probably favourite game time adaptable great modding capability see playing years least get lot playtime money bugs commonplace often swiftly dealt development team really get feel like rewriting history immerse world theres much freedom regarding play sort character etc even create practically godlike character like play game way give challenge try achievements thats prefer favourite strategy game used civ simply moddable amount different content could play seemingly unending promises better modded content works jawdroppingly exciting look forward dlc developers release coming years think anyone loved civ modding scene back day love game bits game seems geared make loss patience spent first hours google reddit checking people figured click click getting obstacles likely fun fun starts twothree hours frustration also damn awful wherever mouse brings popup dialog box dialog box happens different dialog box youre trying read oh well move mouse brings new dialog box possibly bigger move across screen brings dialog boxes move dialog box arent trying read always wants toward center screen always way depth fun game user experience wasnt polished game show us good view medieval era teach us lot history game stole life like stole lieges wife game sufferers imperator rome rulers tribalfeudal play little diversity game play across world nomads alot generic decisions every culture ruler pretty barebones compared dlc two years time doubt great game moment feel might well play dlcmods wait months get fleshed game takes good parts ckii leaves bad parts feature bloat behind large map better mod support ever plenty quality life features im ready another years crusader kings also ruler designer game took time get game great fun offers many different things could happen youll find laughing things pop played ckii past bit couldnt get even trying ckiii still took slight effort trial error much smooth experience though still sometimes tutorial

hours creating dynasty something weird try remove pope power game drunken purchase worried id play understand first hours feeling like terrible mistakehere hours time writing honestly still finding new things fun fact playing vassal actually bad sounds really enjoyed game way much see enjoying time comethe multiplayer great fun however rather flaky least leaving game paused server disconnects ive still established isnt either way gameplay quality game instant manage make great game fun returning players new plays kinds every game launch things need tweaked overall fantastic game play even character creator said return soon free update better crusader kings two every way game wishlist long time say im happy finally got itit worth money gameplay amazing history accuracy point soundtrack engaging relaxing love game game way accessible ckii initial paradox release surprisingly complete without dlc ckiii way roleplaying focused love game good needs least patches game consume first grand

detail game mechanics bit learning curve game great job keeping updated important events need attention game improve world geography skills game let millenials know feels like things kids fun experience cant get enough addicting well balanced feels quite immersive time period game suck hours hours life away constant planning plotting love fun fun game waste life away good way extremely depth lot strategy involved long haul great game would recommend game would awesome oh boy game needs serious balance updates first seduction problem everyone tries seduce everyone often succeeds want see bad gets turn debug mode see everyones real genetic parents father five kids chances none practically defeats purpose cool new depth genetics system added ones parents game says also make common notice qa ill admit world every man cuckold kind funny takes right immersionnext issue immersion birth developers game decided lower chances mother child dying childbirth last game even though already seemed lower point events spending resources comforting wife pregnant little chance going wrong anyways also children almost always grow without many complications even though middle ages large amount children died within first years life im asking hyper realism stuff least make attempt seem feasiblenext issue catholicism seems within hundred years starting catholic europe turned various heresies catholicism comes events turn characters heresies think two main reasons spreads quickly first lord changes religions game changes religion lords lands quickly unrealistically next catholicism gets frequent events lower religious fervor point catholic lands converted far quickly played religions yet cannot comment balance next problem game dynasty head system may missing something seems game explicit explanation current dynasty head selected powerful adult king closely related last dynasty head third cousin count vassal six years old becomes head dynastymany lifestyle perks unbalanced everyone else mentioning comment last issue bring sexuality think step forward add bisexuality asexuality game way sexuality implemented seems like step back first problem characters completely open sexuality character homosexual kept close secret public lords ninth century muslim caliphate completely open gayness makes sense next smaller problem distribution sexualities characters identify homosexual bisexual asexual comparison san francisco highest percentage lgbt people us population identifies lgbt thats representation crusader kings like far need balance game make immersive experienceedit ive got say going get warfare post getting long think two main issues one ai tends zerg rush capital making tedious predictable next issue embarking system cost sending massive armies across seas low ai probably realizes constantly send armies overseas also makes distance sea travel barely matters unlike expensive fleets made use sparingly least big enough use vassal fleets fix honestly think reverting back naval system work something would best optionthe peace treaty system hand something definitely carried isnt dynamic realistic think best kind would something like victoria sides add certain claims demands cost something unlike essentially demand whatever want though also option demand money reparations like game would aptly named cuck kings based bug present

feeling im gamebut first time tried im already engaged gameplay graphics makes welcoming game im edge thumbs keep playing learning curve slow starts probably going turn almost everyone dedicated fan sort game looking game sim rpg rather strategy game given ability switch kingdoms wont readily apparent everyonepros lots historical context world full people interact rulers dynasties instead immortal rulers means mix game style map covers essentially europe asia good chunk africa ability switch realm youre playing opens options play narrative rather competitive focus game emphasis total dominationcons lousy ui much clicking around particularly challenging managing intrigue diplomacy interacting wealth characters game slow game starts despite launching established explored world gold cheats help many actions take long game years intrigue options take silly amounts time limit intrigues active time low least starting military management intuitive weak even start figure bugs course worst seen far strong army somehow becoming strong army enemys numbers went combat started instead game mechanic ambush happened nothing could see told mewishes fixing cons mode play nonruler otherwise start much smallerit feels like rich mine complexity poor ui slow game starts make huge time investment feels like mixing metaphors historical diplomacy real time strategy far much results glacial play keeps busy crawling screens result feels grindythe ui fun killer game trying make diplomacy intrigue paramount yet much information actions buried behind multiple layers menus screens feel like im going pause slowing game way often need get tasks exacerbated inconsistent handling ui elements widgets map screen move stay view bring side window others dont ones get hidden seem often ones need keep eye game isnt pause game also explains concepts poorly youre never quite sure relationship one vassals means anything ui also terrible around armies map view general click right spot often armies seems like click feet bc map location little man hot spot capital little hard get right click get city instead character details raising armies takes serious getting used really easy really screw get beyond handful territories im still sure im actually drawing properly strength vassals wargame starts slow theres meaningful way ive discovered change start tutorial limits ireland feels like trying build skill kingdom whole lot seems like kingdoms ive started position immediately conquer neighbors youd overextended immediately seems like youre hours turning turtle build really start playing game aggressively sometimes enjoy often want accelerated start even playable kingdoms bigger start feel need turtle much start game operates around dynasties rather immortal rulers poor explanation game mechanics incredible amount game time many diplomacyintrigue actions seem take often see ruler dying whole lot important current ruler player character watching relationships get changed succession needing basically restart threads painful thats partly realistic successor ward better complete influence thats limited number intrigues support time incredible length time take become problem adds unfortunately meaning cheat codes probably future tweak game play good follow much fun good game good game good game play like start drama good game review complete fall sales tasks good game despite negative review however paradox let refined bland sequel one best grand strategy games ever released ui roleplaying decisions game mediocre successor opinion ui particular despite step towards right direction ugly uninspiring map significant upgrade beautiful artistic immersivebut importantly lack nomads societies republics significant features make game inferior product predecessor time however im aware paradoxs monetization practises safely say game eventually surpass quality release major expansions years development exactly review subject change future good game much pog good game somewhat lacking updates starting good game hard good way get mind gutter good game daughtersisterwife agrees good game play good one solid foundation build uponthis

complicated never played ck ii ck took hours figure play familiarize mechanics complicated learn youll find extremely fun great game easier get enjoy playing hours without getting bored definitely worth full price great game mods fun play great game great game loved think even better great game thoroughly enjoyed ck ii developers taken everything good game made even better ck iii great game currently somewhat lacking variety really get feudal christian experience differences gameplay playing anything else negligible said still offers much focus procedural storytelling dynastic politics quickly become one favorite games general great game much possible many alternate histories must play great improvement ck franchise game mechanics lot easier understand previous game mention game right fun play introduction new functions made game lot entertaining include troop qualitymenatarms regiments life focuses intrigue plots many would definitely recommend game anybody new acquainted crusader kings also great game start understand map games play great sequel worth buy full price contains improved tutorial improved ui new mechanics eg stress system animated characters ignore whiners giving game thumbs doesnt contain dlc content bought sequel vanilla brand new game different dlc compared unfair give thumbs accuse devs make buy worth dlc devs havent even announced new dlcs yet many plan produce right already lot fun without dlc one best strategy games ever played great sequel original confused get ahead tutorial really made easier understand time stress system great innovation role playing different levels information zoom map great idea new ui makes everything easier understand looks good generally different kinds experience scores allow try different goals ruler one favorite steam games far century great skeleton paradox game unless super grand strategymanagement games group really want play isnt worth yet give couple years buy dlc bundle given time exceptionalalso game needs serious balancing great start continuation series needs lot development could use lot historical accuracy boosting example raiding restricted cultures religions game several christian kingdoms known raid without technical state war scottish would often raid northern part england distracted foreign entanglements also need work intrigue portion game see coming development game far give stars really good start hope better development future great update crusader kings series things feel lacking really outweighed benefits new ui great fantastic game many things manage fantastic history simulator type game doesnt require win simply enjoy story youve build dynasty gameplay similar ck series thus far slight tweaks notably graphics lot better characters aging time gaining visual traits reflect abilities new hyperlinking mouseover features make easier ever find necessary conditions events diving deeper character historiesoverall think game excellent successor paradox stop nickel diming players feature packs release actual beefy expansions huge step ui much easier see actually tell whats happening time roleplay fun amount customization always welcome lots mechanics use work would say solid game however games vassalage system behaves highly unrealistic point piss de jure vassals want independence instead supporting another kingemperor border gore game absolutely burn eyes holy roman empire start date fall apart years game time way vessels behave huge downside game things completely randomly powerful vassal positive opinion spy master vassal still revolted fk thats really need fix ways vassals behave point total utter ridiculousness counts tyranny also really dumb tell vassal stop war another vassal refuse trying imprison count tyranny vassalage system joke needs huge overhaul short reign penalty needs nerfed everybody loved previous emperor new one donate treasury vassalage combat men arms mechanic solid although archers seem little overpowered one gripe interactions break immersion characters side diplomatic range scots character seduce swedish one within days im pilgrimage jerusalem able interact vassals kings people try seduce pilgrimage traveling army take time rather instantly teleporting capitol sieged youre assign army save war form jaws defeat also need events happen familiar paradox supports games post launch game fun would recommend especially friends play lots frustrating mechanics game make want tear youre hair idrect upgrade waiting dlc features get added really fun like maybe ability customize ruler map generation various rules dont understand got left behind launch worthy sequel ck ii must game anyone fan genre paradox must buy might best games hands depth weight every action polished rewarding literally feel like im building stories legacies completing string events get xyz end game state perfected version last game good poggers game honestly dont know paradoxs grand strategy games great

genetic familial legacy themes game find sort thing fascinating ill confess still havent mastered comerce game ive found speed building improving things somewhat frustrating times though game meant played several hundered years im cool conclusion sort person prepared learn bit enjoys history game sort person enjoys strategy games game sort person loves stories wants experience epic saga noble family accross ages game certainly enjoy really cool game one think rpg strategy game really fun game become tedious time consuming manage every single county title prevent future wars fun minigame unfortunatly stops becoming game pour hours way delegate aspect game would much fluid fun nothing wrong hours solid gameplay fundefinately glad purchased game would recommend anyone interested history

siege capital moment apart viking raiders cultures march army back period get boat head enemys capital alert youll soon find ways deal expect ai behaviour war get attention sooner later substantial improvement previous paradox launches understand game already horrendously confused never played ive heard easier approachable experience mean game bit easier would like roleplay helps hope paradox adds harder difficulties even ai buffit fun opinion setbacks succession crises civil wars wish aspects empires declining byzantine empire usually grows substantially superb game enjoy intrigue character interactions feels like taking part game thrones without dragons monsters intrigue politics set courts early late middle ages fascinating many complaints see game players trying put modern day values interactions game work suggest going away research succession laws life middle agesanyway game fantastic release good enough play know paradox game treat future many additions gameplay time

hordes items buildings still limits diplomacy side like events source receiver increasing opinion relatively minordid played different nations culture period yet though content might richer yetbut new launch clean fan series need hesitate way better normal release paradox think people gotten bit overzealous ratings im gonna try bring perspective major annoyances ive seen partition inheritance blows cant get rid last years game ive rarely ever played get around first dozen times spending hours murdering heirs loses charm becomes chore even cheating doesnt fix bullshit since every month checks allowed certain laws reverts crusades completely broken right crusade maybe gets andalusia great reformed norse faith happens half powerful established vassals realm dont lose titles new crusader king maybe troops faces incessant unstoppable revolts religious rebels every year flips crusader kingdoms back original faith cases tribal starts pretty much waste time right changing tribal feudal always

game shows ui graphics big improvement tons great options play stories generate characters ones remember minor bugs ivars armies get attacked jorvik early start mostly smooth gameplayif like grand strategy like medieval period love gameparadox needs make sure games get attention game got release tired streamlined games missing features pay later dlc look absolute heralding masterpiece worthy consideration among great epics antiquity tons features life altering decisions endless array characters youll come love hate build duchy kingdom empire switch moment another faction year destroy built seriously best game ive played looong time recommend instant classic btw get use massive sometimes overwhelming ui rather quickly tis good tis good game tis great tis pretty good newcomer crusaders kings games playing first time seem daunting found tutorials watched guides read best way learn enjoy game play fuck try youre fence making purchase due reason go well worth money see hours

could tell game given time perfected first bought game wasnt buggy glitchy straight forward overall fun play even today constantly giving game content importantly giving away free part really rare day would definetly recommend game honest far best paradox release ive seen last years fun beard cape sleep cousin win putting moves neighbors youngest daughter son idea good time crusader kings got juicy fruits galore inner whore improved graphical interface simplified tutorial banging relatives time flat torturing butt lovers blackmailing soy boys get bidding int deck proven franchise advances even yet abyss endless menus titles political implications big picture game traversed ground level fertile environment call endless hours researching obscure rules barrel monkeys bought royal edition thank god premium content dresses chicks make ring much true begin almost completely new strategy games like ive played couple hours really enjoy mates hyped game decided give trywhat say besides totally overwhelmed understand game concepts minutes closed game really disappointed guys fun beginning please trust methis game amazing get used everything totally doable fun create dynasty expand kingdom onthis game much discover many opportunities highly recommend try even maybe like really games like maintaining dynasty aspect worth buying although ive got say came tough frustrating often options cannot anything really nasty thins example loosing empire remove one pointrating preface really wanted like game hours easily one favorite strategy games end came blind didnt watch dev diaries prerelease games could judge game purely finished product said solid game retains many positive features predecessor characterfocused gameplay good simulation feudal vassalage system endless replayability due rng branching game decisions noticeable improvements made increase character roleplay inclusion stress mechanic clever way encourage player adherence ruler traits without restrictive theres also far events tailored specific lifestyle enjoy really make think hard character character react fleshed scheme system makes plots actually interesting follow feels much immersive sway liege assassinate rival ever one favorite additions new siege mechanics rng siege events totally random never actually made much sense seeing increasing starvation disease take garrison faster much logical appreciate change heres problem even though good game cant help feeling like paradox played safe making sequel didnt add truly innovative additions predecessor hours play found processes appeasing vassals fabricating claims planning marriages find enjoyable made feel slightly disappointed get beyond cool new roleplay features enhanced scheme system new military system core plays essentially fact moments considered launching instead continuing one games highlights feel missed opportunity create different new gameplay environment would interesting learn veteran new player perhaps change dlc additions come stands right theres enough makes want drop entirely favor another issue ive noticed rng still heavily present game longer truly random dont get wrong weird rng moments made sense given context see siege events one thing really well catching player guard even hours gameplay doesnt really seem happen lot events set timer increases time special events claim fabrication great example good chancellor increased probability fabricating claim didnt guarantee within specific window time could fighting two wars suddenly get option gain claim gold cant actually spare new system basically know max days court chaplain fabricate claim sort insanely fast imo realize start saving appropriate gold rarely caught guard goes sieges one beauty super random events enemy army could lose surprising amount soldiers besieging one holdings could give edge needed engage field battle even ground basically constant attrition attacker barring supply problem makes difficult smaller army take larger one without hiring mercs even numbers sum good game cant recommend time current state game feels much like heavily improved totally different title really makes hard justify buying game probably get cheaper hopefully fleshed time goes unless really want play gameplay improvements mentioned would advocate get basic gameplay experience prosvastly improved roleplay experience due trait handling better lifestyle eventsfleshed intrigue scheme system makes plots much engaging employnice improvement siege system simulate garrison suffering starvation disease timepretty cool character models try dressing toddlers crusaders barbershopconscurrent version feels lacking content compared dlc additions may change time game progressesmost plotsactions happen set timer rather randomly within mtth window adds predictability game imo makes game slightly less interestingthe ui slightly hard understand especially comes holding management event popups could bias im used interface still rather difficult find certain options various game menus core current version plays similarly almost point feels indistinguishable times hoped new title would also mean plethora innovate additions drastically change gameplay point feels much like heavily improved brand new game put simply great fun beautiful paradox given us masterpiece perfectly evolved series crusader kings mechanics changed much good grown one acknowledge work love devs well done indeed ps hope creative heads ck turn onto imperator make good game quote great swedish fish veery gud review game tell story time game quest

series due improved tutorial ui excellent tooltips truly descendant brings shame predecessori truly enjoy new stuff even enjoy userfriendly changeson note early ireland really easy conquer nice achievements getting truly used game tutorial wholeheartedly recommend itmy next goal lies pagan kingdom literally far east side map time topple pagan king crusade truly fantastic successor truly masterpiece decade truly worthy sequel favourite game timesaint thomas aquinas truly worthy upgrade crusader kings ii content sorely missed looking artifacts societies im sure way truly amazing game paradox concerned would release lackbuster game compared crusader kings expansions one feels complete launch bugs theyre fixed frequent patches imagine much better game become expansions launched truly amazing game fun couple hundred hours definitely good successor would plot kill truly awesome game truly epic living medieval way life political intrigue scheming marriage plots truly medieval world simulator advice play character generate interesting scenarios look traits character think would playing narrative great experience truly fun game historic elements liking ck thus far truly one best games ever made truth told im brand new series whole first time play crusaders kings becoming one favorite strategy title time yet everything interesting enjoyable including complex setting varied decisions shake whole universe dynasty ends historical accuracy ai comes history going motions thats fine us though see developers took artistic liberties representation medieval europe nevertheless characters look fantastic medieval uniforms ai seems smart enough make good decisionsto sum crusaders kings good job creating wellmade believable simulation ruler mid ages even dont feel like micromanaging stuff theres still plenty keep things interesting im quite interested handled transition kings regular lords really liked going far back start seeing strange shift towards political conflict players ai thing though almost game involving politics would need kind system center whereby decisions made solely based around money games take anything different try crusader kings since free like love game trying find something pushes come back find always starting new games really coming back old ones sometimes mid game really grind let treaties character expire enjoy game slow times slowwwww findmyself speed clicking notifications mindlessly get certain date game lets play turn family tree family circle iediting steam awards lmao turned europe bunch naked people good religion recommended turned family tree family circle would recommend turns game traits passed next generation well first child giant second child dwarf third child hunchback inbred huh perhaps sleeping sister isnt really good ideanext try seduce horse caligula style well definitely recommending drama show turns really fun disney villain turns make great games release well two big game randomly unselects whatever selected random window pops change settings everytime starting game u humble duke tending crops small land commit incest going crusade choice ui clunkier less efficient still great game even though still prefer ui much intuitive found actually able get game easier think design tutorial recommended starting characters makes easy learn important things quick nuances time ui much better predecessor ui still bit clunky cant wait character creation much better imperatorfor matter much better crusader kings launch ui much easier graphics great love roleplaying aspects little difficult find items compared ui much friendly graphics character models look great religion cultural system huge improvement said ive played christian kings pagan religions never thing combat naval system could definetly improve im sure thats comingonly starting dates im sure improve well ui needs lot work surprisingly good release paradox different beast yet familiar update year hell create characters syphilis enjoy watching ckii streams lets plays youtube dumbfounded found didnt live enjoyment watching played another crusader kings would recommend watching still eg arumba thisll help explain indepth take dive game far less difficulty beforenot easier get finely aided tutorial feels better overall overwhelming beginning complexity oh boy im going deny inherited much added ckii dlcs new benefits hindsight paradox given ckiis age comes form ui gameplay tweaks feel right accommodate new players ever beforethis certainly isnt deepest commentaries reviews lack detail comes someone enjoyed watching ckii immensely couldnt get playing maybe although given much im enjoying ckiii cant see happening time soon ugh soo goood head trying bring expectations since sequel ckii well sequels arent always good ckiii broke expectations upgraded ui new gameplay elementsim loving sure things missing ckiii baseanyone knows pdx knows iteration brings better better features base game sorry seems rushedgotta get back playing ckiii ultimately many quirks engine simplistic design decisions ruin experience make reluctant play example stress kill people chain reactions dynasty people maybe whole dynasty die day stress nothing could salvage save many hours careful keep dynasty alive theres also systems feel rough edges happy admit feel like improvement ckii especially regarding face variety say wait years developers flesh game modders adequate time fix things add things allow game finish cooking look forward trying pointin current state game fun get past sense house cards kicked arbitrary unfitting random design decisions underdeveloped overly simplistically implemented game elements wish could play feel invested committed save unfortunately seems save timebomb theres ui issues slightly fixed mods like one adding scrollbars menus wish certain lists wouldnt close automatically also able resize elements open separate panel popup list modding bit headache blame wrap things fun game like losing save rng isnt well thought um pretty fun lady poc like choose multiple racists like extra freedom even morals incest naked religions etc like fact options unbelievably better lot replay ability flow game continue fast enough unbelievably fun one ruler average stats double territory vassals love found new kingdom im become exalted among men declare war kingdom next leader dies obesity problems year old son takes kingdom vassals hate perfect opportunity take neighboring kingdom ruined first time game faction rebels yeah pretty fun undoubtedly one best strategy games ever going get better dlcs flavor packs future unfortunately give game thumbs downhere whywhile base systems game improved massively like scheming lifestyles lifestyles amazing really thought good job paradox main concern game clearly based around playing europe feudal systems received really interesting features vassal contracts contracts benefit innovations thats tribal system based prestige much like base game arabicturkicberber based clan system complete joke basically tribal system innovations unlocked useless due adding new perks feudal contracts clan government doesnt management except crown authority cultures like africans share tribal system norwegians cultures tibet byzantine empire feudal like europe right game fun creating religion done want play culture except european nothing except creating new faith would advise buying game expect content compared dissapointed unfortunately features still better guess improved overall nice playing unknowingly played hours felt like unlike lot paradox grand strategy games crusader kings iii manages build previous installment produce experience feels complete rewarding start unlike paradox games launch feels finished game comes basically features base game plus dlc base price point well feel though game welcome grand strategy fans library unplayable crashes time freezes shame looks like itd really fun game worked unreal game great upgrade unreal replayability enjoyment like historical roguelike unreal sequel one greatest games time best paradox game ever made get better update date ck probably best complete pdx release also one better games enter grand strategy genre focus story character driven interactions truly modern ui perfect gateway update met minimum specs experienced frequent crashes upgraded gpu went mb ram crashes would recommend ensuring well beyond games minimum specs purchasing would purchase game time game crashes every time play could minutes hours worked paradox support cannot solve issue requested refund steam would honor play time game fun addicting risk purchasing crash issues resolved high paradox support cannot solve crash issue steam refund start crashing hours game play update since new patch ruler designer chance play game litle bit mods like much nowat moment like far better character customization ui confusing clear waiting till ist character customization mods still good alternative updated review case anyone even still caresa lot issues talked previous reviews actively worked already improved ive gotten lots fun game despite sucking suck gosh darn paradox releasing new ck game right finally getting hang previous game took like hours seeing continuously improved complaints arent valid anymore guess ive got recommend game updated ui graphics nice however several flaws make extremely frustrating number one family simulator main character dies entire holdings decimated split bunch npcs understand supposed mechanic however extremely tedious really fun chars predefined traits try go useful actual tree intrigue ruler wants jump balconys ui ok revolutionary anything battles bland boring numbers marching around higher number usually always wins matter quality army wars happen every seconds neverending stream wars start finish cant unless war score fun chasing stacks circles trying catch themim sure vets ck love hail best game ever supposedly rpg based family simulator medieval ages amazingly boring updated graphics ui brought series would recommend new players play around ireland challenge allows grasp game content easy way focus personal dutchy building buildings else updated graphics characters new features different enough like budget suggest waiting sale otherwise grab sure fan ck series enjoy updated review early bugs annoying resolvedid recommend game anybody enjoyed nice evolution game systems user interface means learning curve pretty manageable dont feel lost dont start watching tutorials playing ingame tutorial really like overhaul looking game modern update dont think theres much disappointed updates improves core gameplay mechanics previous game adding numerous features game playing long time come upgraded mechanics graphics incredibly different first ones might include differences dont understand notice im expert excellent fun replayable usually wouldnt mention different game review game however want casei purchased cyberpunk gog also many aaa title games steam released yearcyberpunk runs flawlessly however personally feel crusader kings goty simply replayability content usually games boat loads dlc get sequels tons cut content things missing yes things worked well werent clunky nothey got best parts added dropping lot didnt work new lifestyle system great addition wholeheartedly recommend game usually cup tea game opened eyes grand strategy games like game thrones simulator cool usually company makes sequel mess entire thing trying necessary paradox maintains great parts adds new things well even immersive liked theres reason add game collection usually wait years flesh games via updates dlc game comes pretty solid jump probably one better box experiences ever done yet utterly immersive historical simulator also absurd fun want game better approach imagination uwu big busty adamites good worth fun game great time far alot game varying difficulty great game strategy players fun game get sucked cool game vassals far likely join independence factions get extremely strong game begins give nothing bad events armies spawn different points next rally location rather one large unit way isolate shut gate bubonic plague hits emperors year due plauge ability shut gate ruined entire play due succesion wars plague vassals avoided plague traveling across entire world attrition threat love game needs much work understand events designed happen wipes fun get events success chance years zero successes vast improvement crusader kings tutorials gameplay graphics vastly improved form predecessor ckiii runs smoothly challenging great depth definately recommendation vastly accessible previous crusader kings games takes figure basics sucks entirely get good handle highly recommend playing along pace treating like family simulator less conquer everything game version completely broken mess worthy sequel tons potential growth addictive loving strategy war side around good game barebones needs expansions good pretty much early access cool much headache get much clear easier play deep interesting game dont expect good beginning played game almost hours learn something every run expect spend lot time game prepared learn alot difficult complex love many things keep track good would say like grand strategy games especially paradox style probably like game like medieval hoi without lines guns planes hoi incest good would recommend people like strategy historic games paradox learning curve rates eve loads fun start understand mechanics well put together much choice uncertainty good got lotta free time accesible comparing paradox titles already fun critical features plus plenty new ones eg stress mechanic giving game whole new layer great foundation future expansions cant wait develop even addicted game good easy understand mechanics really rich world beautiful map still keeps lot intrigue mystery great game right get little easy boring im sure dlcs updates fix great game addicting game bit learning curve though shouldnt issue experience type game would recommend sure addictive civilization type game injects lot personality characters really makes want see family dynasty succeed addictive game needs lot work equal depth predecesor im sure patches dlcs perfect crusader kings gamei like lot things new ck lets name list stress mechanic good force roleplay good immersive knight men arms system clever cause adds strategy game counter enemy troops depending man arms place keep mercenaries case need extra force related previous numbers battle important less quality troops make great difference easy conduct battle ui new buttons functions like one allow leave troops need siege ui workflow pleasing play listthe game also needs tweaks lets name things consider needs ajustmentslist allies ask help often even dont even need help easy gain territory tribal even easy conquest new territory theres almost problem integrating new territory new culture faith send counsellors years integrated perfectly seems theres almost challenge even dont send counsellors revolts minimal big enough country countries dont attack anymore dont unite forces prevent growing even keep conquering conquering owner entire world xdd think kind conferation system like euiv prevents going nutslistin resume im great time playing game know lot better couple years like paradox games addictive sandbox simulator game ruling early medieval till industrial revolution add ons liked youll love one main goal game continue family tree whether hold land liege become emperor large amount land choose faith lifestyle skill tree arranged marriages family line continue game must buy strategy game lovers definitely worth shot everyone else sale recommend tutorial never played ck past watching vid explain mechanics confusing new players barebones absolute quality stress mechanic encourages roleplay doesnt limit options game even encourages stress sometimes expanded intrigue nice religions heresies fantastic combat much interesting county developmentmy complaints followsthe multiplayer funky sometimes logs paradox account randomly meaning youll randomly drop games supposedly fixed hasnt though maybe thats shitty connection never problem republics arent yet paradox said werent going charge money features already included nomads republics better come flcdiplomacy barebones would liked see sort barter systemall would definitely recommend game however definitely wary paradoxs dlc traps challenging also rewarding lose something doesnt mean game keeps going adjust fallout kind gameplay always opportunity bounce back various mechanics make game replayable challenging real time strategy cool rpg elements detailed world characters major bugs playthrough far one favorite paradox games ive played complex interesting many different ways play game rewarding fun specific way complex layered game faint heart somebody looking casual gaming experience game like civilization really anyway really need read research play game successfully said game beautiful gameplay awesome put time understand highly recommended purchase game trying put time play game complex rewarding youre willing stick complex great fun game complex understood game lot fun complicated good fun still glitches cool cool cool cool koifish cool cool ck cool game never played earlier versions downloaded waiting bauldurs gate oh man glad got super detailed first game kind seen deep highly addictive challenging short awesome strategy game dense game easy understand much better ckii opinion terms beginner series getting started difficult youve never played crusader kings definitely mature game disappointing appreciate effort creativity developers however game pictures clicking even game clicking nice pictures high expectations new title paradox tried titles city skylines great remaining clicking game far worse hard believe may moders get somewhere game costly offering fun doubts successful comparing fun get medieval engineers like medieval theme disappointing dynasty based overall good game easily replayed variety different culture groups religions lead take control countries empires eventually world takes little time learn makes rewarding game easy enter expanded tutorial also incredible deep time easy get back vet almost every aspect improved theres less annoying micromanagement focus unfolding storygreat ironman mode achievements enabled together quirky rules like gender reversal equally common sexual orientations managed lot funny situations playing tuscan princess first game died year old queen romagnia due self flagellation wound repent life adultery drinking matricide made sense engaging intuitive game smoother get product made paradox eat free time fans genre enjoyable detailed strategy game fun alone friends basically total war civ combined hint stellaris find ai somewhat competent allthough many people dont agree still havent find situation allies werent useless example played sardinia got mass attacked three different muslim factions called allies came island defend even came way northern france allied armies tend follow around like game however flaws could definetly minor improvements could made probably nearest futurefirst annoying stuff like inviting friends session copying session key dosent work type long ass code inv people easy tp fix pls annoying second find sometimes frustrating wars work time one army attack enemy capital enemy dosent give fuck defending said capital goes hannibal flank around fucking globe get capital mean yeah attack best defense guess feel way annoying deal surely defending main capital empire ais main priority seems realistic dunno even weaker army thats opinion atleastthird rework research tied culture feel like would work better seperated meaning learning used research culture obtained way example events desicions etc basically would love content areafourth point last religion creating faith expensive costs way much piety lackluster mechanics find rather spending piety literally anything else overall would say worth time seek chill interesting game games strength lies story make charachters development charachters events fun immersive shape future dynasty map huge looks awesome cant wait new dlcs added filling even interesting content allthough think game could cheaper bucks seems greedy taste especially free basically equal amount content hopefully add free dlcs fill greedyness rating enjoyable game im new crusader kings im bit trouble adjusting stuff like game lot fun enjoyable game want sit back relax enjoyable game liked previous crusader kings one also better state launch gameplay still largely streamlined example strangeness indulge created religion everybody nude society women favored men woman leader played fierce warrior husband owned empire keep holdings close used give male council members died would return holdings died played first daughter tried imprison younger sister inherited lot titles bloody civil war able imprison immediately executed gain titles could even choose execution options nice oh years old profit enjoyable game even though first looked unappealing visually true paradox fashion dictate enjoyment game though prepared invest time enjoyable like paradox games one way goits got personality stories create awesome evil likeor play paragon virtue always careful threats external internal enjoyable obviously content plus tons dlc included features missed overall best paradox game release cough cough imperator coughreally like new stress mechanic hook intrigue system also ui clearer confusing ai could use work competent warfare least normal difficulty still ton border gore happening especially compared plus dlc think exclave penalties introduced later patches dlc apparently make absolute recommendation uninstalled probably never touched entertaining entertaining would highly recommend entertaining big sandbox making dynasty extensive really fun addition new update create characters
