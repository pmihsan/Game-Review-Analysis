even played real musician course best school uniform designan overall enjoyable experience warm heart absolutely wonderful game yuzusoft manages make another great gameedit months buying game im happy say murasame route made come back replay total times admittedly ive always huge fan history genre since girls always wear super adorable clothes era however technically senrenbanka play era village protagonist visits happens somehow stuck past therefore suspected game little bit different usual games im used rather played either modern times well past describe appeal genre would say mostly female characters often strong personality especially since grew constant danger around themsenrenbanka opens masaomi visiting village hoori see grandfather lives thus memories spending childhood well village quite special since seems stuck past time tries draw blade stuck stone lot people tried achieve without success however happens masaomi breaks blade half totally shocked starts get aware murasame caretaker divine blade luckily manages restore make worse take responsibility actions gets involved arranged marriage villages shrine maidenas aforementioned found technically mixed genres appealing since often happened unsure genre want play im sure relatable sometimes one mood something lighthearted whilst times action would nice change scenario well however despite containing modern past era hardly feels like actually play modern time besides masaomi little bit surprised beginning yet accepted pretty soon wasnt really different usual history games ive played although would say less gory sometimes senrenbanka makes use merge uses modern clothes casual occasions characters schoolof course action isnt missing well one interesting parts game unfortunately curse lingering family protagonist purify evil beings confirms suspect strong female characters usually fights childhood friend bodyguard actually found female characters independent adorable top really appreciate girl isnt helpless get protected guy simply female senrenbanka masaomi fighting spirits together nice resolution still takes care honestly lot romantic work togethertalking romantic ultimate fan arranged marriages like masaomi forced marry someone therefore evident spend lot time thing like relationship resembles hateandlove relationship unknown reasons shrine maiden really like well beginning least however heartwarming see slowly opening behavior started change well secretive reason doesnt friends besides bodyguard thats fine since relationship adorable one easily tell theyre close despite different personalitiesnow disappointing thing basically zero romance available common route although arranged marriage promising premise felt rather like common route focused entirely telling story done romance starts bloom initially wouldnt mind concept well yet shame genres didnt get merged within common route rather feels like went action storydriven visual novel first ended sliceoflife dating sim half game honestly would much interesting elements would present timein total four main romance routes available two subroutes unlock going least one route although choices alter events
