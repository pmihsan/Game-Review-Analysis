chill honestly probably game id actually recommend friends honestly wish game maybe first impressions ever game title expressed idea walking simulator short hike sh would certainly come mind since im biggest fan games like typically wouldnt play however sh came monthly humble bundle great reviews caved peer pressure plus though graphics looked kind strange sh also looked cute charming wanted see fuss sh miles short makes crave need find pier walk gameplay title game isnt misnomer central gameplay sh involves going around island climbing peak ie going hike plus unless insist finding secrets reaching zenith fairly short wrapped game hours going back explore everything missed might take another hour however additional mechanics give simply trek check sights since play bird person youre able glide jumping combines quite well mountainous terrain youre also able fish various bodies water dig goods speak locals helping basic fetch quests rewards rather simple theres enough areas interest scattered around wont walk far coming across something controls walking main mechanic sh controls arent complex movement controlled l joystick used glide climb interact environmental objects bring menu either start select items inventory use marked yellow dot use item equipped tap b want put item away hit l bumper getting running shoes youll hold x run one issue controls figuring kept nosediving gliding seems happen either glide flow let go l joystick story play claire assume young teenager based acts shes considerate willing confront others nonsense theres also general surliness shown someone lounging bed morning theyre bored aside see intro conclusion isnt much story shown many npcs brief conversations dont want give away sh ends tie together sense family togetherness associate summer back growing light touch game dont interact family much know next nothing anybody yet dialogue central issue relate people basic level plus claire teenager makes sense shed left thing light encouragement get fun instead cooping cabin day graphics mixed feelings graphics one sense cutesy designs charming enjoyable however also find theres something screwy enough visuals throw disorient hurt eyes times get used im sure graphics offkilter part looks like another pixelated game reasonable pallet mountain environment isnt something learned later issue arose default settings turn pixels graphics options makes game look smooth didnt cause problem anymore sound design sh uses basic instruments guitars drums composition though interesting sound effects tossed well calm relaxing tone well suited mindset taking casual stroll outdoors understand song variant based around youre im sure triggers get enough golden feathers sustain longer glide youll notice song change stay glide several seconds contrast climbing upwards pros simple gameplay pretty charming able casually switch fishing exploring nice freedom nothing committal sh plus gliding around surprisingly fun gather decent amount golden feathers sufficient stamina deal requirement without difficulty good reward finding several like dialogue characters written seems genuine believable doesnt hurt npcs either nice funny cons appreciate compass without map kind useless bit difficult figuring things relation one another find something youre looking theres also tracking system fetch quests like although liked ending sh actually get end card credits misses mark ever slightly think triggered conversation aunt would poignant games selling price pretty steep short experience tips im quite used jumping letting go button tapping get glide start climbing sh want get habit holding button right pushing useful whether climbing gliding youre able save quit time dont worry losing progress duck early final thoughts sh good job capturing enjoyable parts walking simulators atmospheric enough maintain interest assuming doesnt screw eyes way sometimes yet also laid back theres urgency rush simple objectives tasks location also provides enough stimulus something focus accomplish could improved quality life additions casual experience enjoy want mellow game finished pretty quickly unless want really thorough finding things almost goes grain games intention wouldnt much reason play indefinitely thats would recommend sh youd want pick sale instead paying full price
