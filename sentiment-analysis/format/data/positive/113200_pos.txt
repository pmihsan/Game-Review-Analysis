manages escape mom trying rid sake godthis first roguelike ive encountered actually drives people stay alive using story roguelikes throw world save somethingsomeone love prevent kind world catastrophe binding isaac however creates mental repercussion player isaac die basement mother would sacrifice drive save poor innocent boy hands death guides player careful possible strive onthe use religious artifacts symbolism game simply brilliant references makes devil god interesting way offensive albeit leaning towards dark side vast myriad items tarot cards trinkets contribute high replayability game also gives player chance creating multiple strategies overcome game needless say many many moments weigh value items reluctantly choose youd like hold proceed levels top trading economy system game wellbalanced makes good headache deciding much life sacrifice exchange powerthe soundtrack really nice exceptionally awesome theres nice kick graphics wise nothing fancy highly

youll drop next floor repeat process let talk difficulty quickly find game mess around start three hearts hit takes away half heart six hits youre dead die go back beginning game absolutely saves top often face multiple enemies move faster shoot projectiles also extremely little recovery time hit youll need explore every room hopefully find powerups money pay little bit health dont expect find much health throughout stage except bosses easily one difficult games ive actually still managed fun yes frustrating times never seems unfair game plays certain set rules always abide theres certain amount comfort knowing enemies hand range mildly annoying downright evil youll see buy gamethe games aesthetic design great music great story macabre pretty interesting control good game consistent dark atmosphere would call overthetop dark humor art level design part pretty simple thats okay game comes cartoony think contributes overthetop gothic feel artistically speaking kinds runs similar vein salad fingerswhile binding isaac repetitive theres actually lot variety game mixes bosses room randomly generated random enemies random items ton different powerups feel like youre going motions reason doesnt story isnt anything deep course semblance actual plot nonexistent play floor drop next wash rinse repeat similar diablo fashion people may like thats fine know thats game seemingly meaningless trek initially irked ive gotten used see game really trying something far original arcade shooters go one probably best ive ever played nosave feature necessary feel encourages retrying retrying builds skill random nature game definitely plus never play game exact map enemy placement twice games large amount variety ensures game high replay valueive gone back forth opinions game originally mixed feelings less conventional aspects didnt jibe personal preference however strangely addicting fun difficulty spikes fifth floor gets opinion nearimpossible levels without mastery moment price point base game dlc good fun timewaster especially youve got dark sense humor even though im really fan arcade shooters one sucked cant really explain said art design music controls good game gets incredibly difficult always seems fair importantly binding isaac doesnt claim something important see ive gone back mixed feelings say recommend one dark sense humor andor enjoy difficult games binding isaac bizarre retelling biblical tale name imaginative horrifying two playthroughs core gameplay retains formula isaac alternate characters unlock comb depths basement many torturous chambers search items save points checkpoints hope atmosphere game cute grotesque duality reminds invader zimoverall execution game superb simplicity initial mechanics inviting complexity variable stats certain items provide give perfect level depth arcade style play unfortunately game frustatingly hard multiple playthroughs poor luck item spawns playing seem like chore fans dark souls demon souls looking level masochism setting need look awesome visuals fit art styleresponsive controlshundreds literally hundreds itemsdifficulty complexity increase playthroughkilling final boss might satisfying thing ill binding isaac blast however binding isaac rebirth new improved version game better every way still great game course shouldnt hold back go enjoy entire game rebirth binding isaac brilliantly made roguelike game lots random features like new game every time never seems get old binding isaac brutal unforgiving game recommended casual gamer style unique especially considering dark elements simple story made fantastic dungeon crawler adventure also really love legend zelda aspects well references games castlevania simons quest everytime die dungeons respawn random items game based skill luck went entire play without finding silver keys quite frustrating youre gamer really likes challenge game oh yeah warned save check points entire gamelove game even died constantly since purchasing binding isaac charmingly dark indie title young naked character exploring basement bid escape homicidal mother basic gameplay nes legend zelda combined twin stick shooter overlayed random game changing power ups run entices see combinations items make much help progress increasingly difficult levels however items get far true reason keep coming back improve skill basic move shoot mechanics go beyond standard twin stick shooter become shoot em nature roguelike follows closely name sake every run random progression run run addition available pickups randomness items could lean favour make nearly unstoppable could destroy way typically play game forcing learn new way approaching challenges presented summation binding isaac thoroughly entertaining experience balances random skill based aspects nearly perfect degree would recommend game anyone enjoys skill based games also accept inconsistencies another challenge overcome binding isaac classic rougelike dungeon crawling adventure interesting images ideassimple controls good combat together mixed bunch items good bad make amazing gameit quite challenge worth price binding isaac controversial roguelike dungeon crawler sends world madness pain quite frankly enjoy game quite lot especially dlc wrath lamb writing review remake rebirth enjoy game lot would recommend anyone enjoys hard zeldaesque games great soundtrack insane replayability story makes think real downsides could find game loading errors errors occur quite frequently crash game ruins runoverall think game great anyone likes zelda like game binding isaac curious game holds dark story filled metaphorical literal links bible presented weirdly unique graphic setting playwise perhaps defining aspect game sheer amount item combinations achieve conjunction fitting artstyle deranged story difficult gameplay provides fun frustruation end binding isaac cutely disturbing game nice animated graphics good music whole lot wtf moments whoever made game isnt right head lol binding isaac dark difficult game also lighthearted frustrating sounds contradicting true gameplay tbi places isaacs basement isaac must go inevitably faces mom interestingly levels always going different time play new game die wont things since levels always different takes frustration isaac also collects unique powerups dont tell use sucks adds element surprise since powerups arent always going help aesthetically game disturbing gore form demeanor enemies also lightheartedness comes isaac thats present game cutscenes overall thought really good game

amazing bosses hard makes game replayable want win tis good tis good tldr actual negative review isaac story unnecessarily dark leads polarizing audience game would actual game controller support dumb personally seems repetitive regardless rougelike elements got boring fast binding isaacs story highly juvenile fact im seeing people call story good making scratch head isnt good dark themes game highly unnecessary game really rougelike dungeon crawler game sure newgrounds feel missing humor instead dark comedy vive like thought going seems lot focused dark part story almost like trying taken seriously time parts makes funny laughable time course youre probably wondering im harping story much obviously purpose game reason way story seems polarize audience one side either caring story liking theyre hardcore atheists like anything antireligion side people arent comfortable story feel distracting game polarization seems unnecessary since story minor part game feel like game could still unique identity different storythe binding isaac really nothing wrong mechanically though fact controller support people dont want download separate program play game controller game really controller game keyboard controls feel awkward hell besides might even rougelike elements game feels repetitive bored pretty quickly rather mediocre topdown rogue action game dark humor keep returning

isaac little kid whose mom nuts wants kill descends trap door room fight way creepy places creepy monsters bgameplay simple hard master controls depends anyones taste game economy shtload upgrades active skills consumables discovered upgrade skill interesting fun mess around tempting google way better fun pick something see levels randomized lot various monsters bosses spice things wont play game way twice point view game offers infinite replayability fact everything heavily randomized prevents forming sort strategy dive keep going win die time reduces cool variety point youre thing
