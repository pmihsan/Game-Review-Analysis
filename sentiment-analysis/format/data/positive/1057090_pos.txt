allowing varied playstyle one point bench felt hollow knight well perhaps intentional nod adds elements without really sarcrificing core gameplay original would describe movementfocused platformer anything elseif minor criticisms would really cant find reason ever switch abilities like basic slash could see switching basic slash like heavy slash using game havent found convincing reason switching trying new weapons regularly even could able equip time feels limiting want use spinning cross energy weapon spear would mean giving basic attack maybe one essential movement tool weapons meh im finding story beautiful predictable follows first story quite closely overall theme perhaps change one far nothing surprising new really top notch happy give guys money great escape chaotic times another masterpiece moon studios like original however like original one glaring flaw blind forest gameplay mechanics wisps audio bugs moki sound effects hiding shriek sequences resetting random

alt tab click main screen best game year far boss fights arent fun ori games flawed sure feature gorgeous visuals smooth controls make sure play gamepad games completely centered around analogue

mana long hard segment somewhere deep inside spike filled tunnels well theres going lots repetition finally save againand sure enough difficulty common complaint made sequel easier bmuchb easier wisps game autosaves roughly room eat spikes breakfast get powerful healing ability right first area restores lot hit points pittance mana thought maybe game would pick later areas never beat whole thing like deaths compared first game sequel longer game sure soaring around areas cool abilities fun much youre face rolling everything never really struggle basically exploring looking cool stuffbut wait added proper combat bosses yes time around get choose actual weapon instead spamming homing orb picked hammer start game turned far strongest weapon game deals massive damage sends enemies flying even lets stomp ground sending shockwaves quickly dispose enemy groups needless say steamrolled whole game swinging damn thing like great hammer build dark souls big stick goes bonklate game bought weapons nowhere good got thinking bnotb pick hammer would found game frustrating would combat difficulty right ill never know hammer also one two weapons break cracked wallsfloors hold many secrets collectibles throwing spear eats lot mana hammer requires bnoneb theres literally way break wallsfloors pick wrong weapon miss secrets andor combat becomes much harder questionable design choicedue way healing system works bosses rarely threat mostly health sponges theres usually constantly respawning mana crystal boss room let heal damage take boss patterns simple highly telegraphed usually attacks repeat might chase scene beforeafterduring boss fight nothing crazy first gamethe first ori game often compared knighturl seems like developers took competition heart sequel borrows blotb hollow knight even whole areas mechanics spoilermouldwood depths deepnestspoiler bit blatant times mean theres even cartographer npc spawns area sells maps equippable charms act look exactly like hollow knight default sword basically acts like nail hollow knight etc etc felt shameless soulless mention mechanics borrowed hollow knight dont feel anywhere polished dont fit well wish developers focused oris strengths precision platformer instead diluting platforming difficulty much trying make game play like hollow knight ori games make great platformers unique art style enjoyable play

sia allaltezza del primo capitolo questo gioco non solo allaltezza di quello spettacolo di ori blind forest riuscito addirittura migliorarsi ogni aspetto comprato visivo mozzafiato colonne sonore da lacrime e ora anche il gameplay migliorato parecchio con nuove strumenti missioni secondarie davvero non ho parole per descrivere quanto questo gioco sia ben fatto che chiedono quando va sconto non potrebbero essere onesti specie se li valutiamo relazione ai che chiede un aaa medio di scarsa fattura grazie di cuore moon studios per il lavoro che ha fatto e che ci ha regalato perle come queste non sono facili da trovare voto il minimo se vogliamo essere relativi ai voti che vengono dati ad altri giochi ori arriverebbe tranquillamente certainly better first game visuals stunning soundtrack

head start game like first set lock upgrades goodies behind ability walls especially vertically first half cheat code heavy attack somethings reachable without familiar ground stomp ability downheavy attack also give extra inches dash ledge supposed unreachable use upward swing instead find high ground jump use heavy attack straight dash towards target even easy sticky shard upgrade used extra vertical boost constantly sneak upgrades early game also energy cost using unlike every ability sold someone tries sell new abilities get heavy attack firstanother thing comes abilities found didnt always tell everything im missing tutorial text somewhere ready play experiment newfound powers comeso get get upgrades ans slowly become tiny superhero meant become first amazing game changed formula

wrong tastei action dude love compound vr doom etcbut game piece art character world music story masterpiece games reminds started play games love themwell ori moon studios thx trip pure emotionsso boys girls take headset pump op volume let game first havent played ori blind forest would highly suggest playing game first makes one much easier play since youll need master dynamic controls abilities presented ori order really explore nooks crannies gamethat said ori wisps worthy successor blind forest continues story unveiled first game picking left myriad cast bear mind much story visual games highly visual fact many times games necessary explore story order open new areas might otherwise seem inaccessible youre big story might feel like game lacking disagree since brevity soul wit many times arguably less much lack words dialogue made oris world feel like ambient sprites vibrant terrain feels exactly like extension first game novel differencesim hours game point im loving cant wait beat holidays mario meets castlevania one thoughtful games genre thanks xbox studios moon studios bravo first sorry english isnt goodori tearsits fantastic game simple emotional storylinethe gameplay smooth sometimes bit challenging get hang fun playthe background graphics beautiful soundtrack masterpiecethe downside game bit short still decent lengthbut beware emotional side game otherwise tears fall first game amazing lot aspects unique well different first ori though blind forest never feel powerful something keeps invested throughout game dont feel strong relative enemies environment control insane movement thats blind forest strength ability chain movement elegant flows went rooms wisps feels different record played hard start platforming really really good theres much variety technique amazing go one another fast like first one glide across rooms without touching ground way easier get point one especially since get solid half movement abilities first game note got triple jump super early made bit fun something recommend changes game completely lets super fun skips collectables cant really sequence skips basic kit im sure lotsomething want note stole bunch stuff hollow knight bad thing hollow knight one favourite platformersgames time something youll notice played map system similar dialog characters something added characters talking apart spirit guide basically hk noises visual style final sequence almost eerily similarto biggest change first one combat overall combat amazing mob fights fast paced intense fair general one ones flexible entertaining however leads games biggest flaw boss fights bosses blunt terrible like boss fights lot especially hard ones im good damage bosses hollow knight radiant forms beaten data org secret bosses crit general hard boss something love game bosses wisps annoying disappointing boring bosses ive ever faced first boss straight one worst ive ever faced patterns bad bad hitbox floaty combat system dont feel fun fight theyre pretty platforming section thats really good overall theyre satisfying fight played game bounty reckless skills increases enemy healthdamagedrops bounty increase damage takendealt reckless straight turned bosses went cheesy arrow spam strat normal attempts frustrating bosses fight wanted bosses legitimately thing think bad game handled combat well even though pitfalls thought theyd spirit bash ridiculously op get start game massive damage stuns enemies overall really enjoyable make really hard ability switch weapons skills fly make really cool varied combat mobs fun bosses garbagethe story overall good emotional start investing gripping midpoint start act good wish committed spoiling villain good solid motivations actions shames shes introduced late game moki cute first grew annoying shame interesting start turn dumbasss quite quickly little expository dialog theyre thrown side characters better designs brain cellsoverall fun game good secrets metroidvania style map level design good side quests something else added average good combat beautiful visual worth playthough tldr adult owls assholes first game absolute outstanding music graphics story controls fantastic beautiful game play perfect sequel ori blind forest creators really honestly interest playing game make sure play first one one regret first offori wisps basically first game better liked first game mustbuy game feels similar overall also brings lot improvements table importantly actual combat well boss battles fastpaced feels good opinionas lot collect lot youll gathering currency various upgrades going story even designated sidequests interact npcs complete tasks placethe manual save point mechanic present anymore doubt anybody going miss itas abilities previous games movementbased abilities return also new ones along combat abilities arent tied progression howeveranother thing thats returning first ori escape sequences felt easier time around though story similar previous game still different enough liked ending wellmusic graphics beautiful youd expectthe environments cases extremely similar first games still fresh feel course new mechanics introduced well first offthe first game hands one best games ive ever played secondthis game tops ori blind forest every aspect first part set bar pretty high scond one didnt dissappoint oris would buy first playthrough definitely blast feel though done bit story seems like moon studios also wanted alas fell bit short long arent running integrated graphics quality art outstanding gameplaywise definitely improvement blind forest combat techniques encourages spam sentry took sein away also similarities hollow knight mechanics attributes seperate comparison unlike people think iits really fun game depletes soul away attempt deathless order get achievements wayyyy less instadeaths blind forest actually manageable thats plusthe snowballthe snowball first playthrough hardmode times super frustrating also super rewarding go get nostalgia feels first playthrough experience gaming quite like two ori titles wholeheartedly suggest stop reading reviews watching promotional material go right ahead play prosjust like first game art style graphics world nothing comes close beauty game offers visually combat feels similar except weaponspells system complete overhaul allowing pick different weapons offensivehealing spells pleasethe spirit shard system welcome addition allowing equip trinkets change stats provide movementhealing abilitiesnpcs personalities instead spooky voices telling story general feel lot involved world world first get see similar world desolation people still trying get live best canthe platforming rather easy begin gaining lot abilities experiencing new mechanics certain areas game throw decent amount challenge theres one consistent thing always feels consistent satisfying move gamethe pace new mechanics introduced absolutely perfect againthe story yet beautiful disheartening ultimately bittersweetbrating first thing say see hollow knight influence addition full fledged bosses addition sword attack moveset almost pixel pixel knight easy see personally think great slight shift pure puzzleplatforming adding complex combat might turn offthat said level design amazing every map twists turns every way seamlessly hidden paths accessible upgrades game note design map visually stunning area feels distinct unique even areas passageways identity colours feel upgrades interesting one hand abilities first game came back one hand blind forest ability tree three branches unlocked sequence one three ability slots nonessential abilities pick choose abilities want bring though least change fly combat received pretty substantial revamp gone spark light following around shooting enemies time around ability wheel separated previously mentioned ability slots multiple choices normal enemies found levels fairly simple completely ignored however big addition bosses big occupying good portion screen entire bodies deal damage touch variety attacks patterns need master order beat story simple degree rather predictable beautiful captures unique way storytelling combining narrator recounting events almost silent actions emotes characters music words easily best part game even without knowing anything game could listen music understand going oris mind music playing ori blind forest ori wisps best music ive ever heard gamemy one gripe game young owl pictured cover game right together ori game never lets play little story would loved see game dedicated parts owl maybe give chance switch finish story alas first things first recommend game played previous game ori blind forest since think game like ori terms platforming mostly going compare game previous one think changes made improvementsthe negatives bad changesi dont like spirit light system changed previous game found every collectible game went every combat trial still missing spirit essence end game order buy every map upgrade shards stupid game shouldnt require grinding upgrade everything game first game enough experience fully level skill trees without even finding secrets isnt much annoyance dont think introducing grinding platformer good idea biggest complaint game easy normal difficulty hard platforming areas game replaced bosses think paper fine however wish longer segments game difficult platforming segments positivesgood changesthe shard system awesome able customize build throughout game although shards nobrainers made feel like could evolve strategy game went much preferred level system previous game next great thing course music visuals didnt think could make previous games environments better wrong area distinct challenges segments felt unique part map favorite area caves beneath need traversed using light goes die soon thematic crawling spiders approaching angles darkness another great improvement addition characters although game doesnt best voice acting thought writing excellent made character distinct personality gameplay remains relatively unchanged abilities added however never overwhelming like choose abilities max since adds player agency game overall think game took really good first made even better would highly recommend anyone wants great storybased platforming challenge first time played hours gone like nothing amazing game wait keep playing blast streaming feedback even better great job team im love entire game music everything first sound tried hdm nothing web searching ive

heartpounding great time playing game im looking forward future installments love challenge games game best u anyone didnt play predecessor ori blind forest highly recommend playing one first cheaper shorter fewer abilities get used generally less difficult like first ori youll probably like second one anyone played ori blind forest youll probably love one case changed expanded upon roughly twice long completion hard without hardcore achievements like one life original movement abilities multiple new ones lets zip air ever becomes necessary many sections much higher focus different combat abilities fast melee heavy melee fast ranged heavy ranged theyre viable play biggest change absolutely dislike platformer combat check gameplay videos first difficult hollow knight another big change manual saving really took getting used autosaves frequent never lose considerable progress worries also multiple autosaves shouldnt able softlock save escape sequences one far difficult blind forest supposedly toned bit since day writing review bossfights alongside escape sequences theyre awful dont get oneshot anything spirit light currency use buy upgrades basically like get new combat

amazing sequel fun beautiful fun immersive combat really makes feel like ori fun well worth price however may bit nitpicky game heavily takes hollow knights combat system eg shard system though fleshed hk enemy ai bad since hk arguably one best metroidvanias would instead liked exploration leveling perk system perhaps specialized branches tradeoffs choosing perks others previous game escape sequences still octanerich moments game however definitely think game could benefited difficult platforming challenges demanded tighter execution player especially ending sequence maybe future dlc could introduce gauntlet sorts similar path pain hk know game geared towards casual players still something worth thinking audio bugs ruin immersion hope gets fixed soon fun game good difficulty fun

abilities felt purposeful like dashbash upgrades new powers used specific area never appreciate ability play way want id like mandatory items consistently useful throughout adventure metroidvania know thats hard itd nice shame control scheme didnt allow use unlocked moves instead forced cycle timei small tech issues launch hopefully fixed soon progression updatingsaving properly twothree areas stuck even though everything restart game get items already collected reappear map still didnt get achievement midway final boss even though save file already said sometimes ori looks aliased compared environments lots weird buzzing stuttering first moved game onto ssd never happened againoverall great metroidvania oddly easy compared first game definitely good entry point new subgenre progression

excluding extras hidden areas unless thousand iq need guide duration dont want bear rely guides ruin first time experience amazing game hollow knight spoiler even ending like hollow knight bittersweet spoiler hollow knight similar first game lot ways design place visuals upgraded expense gameplay hang wait isnt hollow knight youre sure ok apparently ori game theyve copied multiple mechanics hollow knight badge system map maker even summary screen track game progress caterpillar homes even though caterpillars overall feels like art direction took priority gamplay difficult rate highly ripped mechanics quick time events odd design decisions bprosb extremely pretty sorts things environment waving wobbling full life pass really beautiful soundtrack new mechanics first game like platforms covered blue moss new combat abilities amazingly fluid animations especially ori flips around sticks grabs handstands top poles spins around double jumping traversal really smooth unlock abilitiesbconsb heavier focus combat tons new abilities cant use get buttons abilities one needs main attack probably want able heal leaving one button several different ones needed platforming platforming far easier new movement abilities game full cheap tricks designed kill like portals dumping top spike pits pits youre meant jump poison bottom deadly things slightly offscreen youd know avoid less focused first game map littered side quests irrelevant icons moki dont offer quests still marked map controls good still bit floaty nearly tight hollow knight ripped hollow knights charm system map npc quest summary screen boss design subpar something actually could improved copying hollow knight show boss going provide way avoid damage dont give boss different abilties dont put chase quicktime events middle boss fights quick time events scripted pieces get really tiresome really quickly one bits move hiding place hiding place dozen times couldnt tell next hiding place game focuses pretty rather giving visual hints parts scenery background whats needed gameplay hollow knight wisps good hollow knight betterthey took ori blind forest mixed hollow knight art work nice gameplay felt like rerun hollow knight except goodoh absolutely hated timed run boss sections hollow knight kind scared metroidvenias one much betterplaying game felt like chore one much fun hollow knight ripped game like years came would get stomped owl hollowknight wispsthis game truely feel like successor first ori suggests appears followed hollowknight correctly implemented game great results new checkpointsave system much better last one combat much better beforethe bugs exist encountered mileage may varyi highly reccomend avoiding hard mode unless skilled combat played game blindforest least enjoy pain suffering like game easy first hours finally get boss inflated hp way change difficulty start game unless start new save redo first hours uncertain normal difficulty finally beat game yay main suggestion game able change difficulty midgame since effect inflating bosses hp many hours players might get trapped difficulty give another suggestion seperate grapple bash buttons share button

shines still got bashing dashing instead shooting mechanic first game wield heavy light attacks key though attacks aid movement best part game takes cues celeste adding passthrough contextual movement water sand overall improvement otherwise phenomenal gamethe one gripe audio gameplay bugs couple times clipped wall last fight completely devoid boss audio also chase sequences kinda got old though fun also little bit easier predecessor course didnt shitty canyon part final battle run kuro vein dont think part like ginso tree though couple points came kinda closeif least depending whether think perfection achieved holy hell either game gets platforming metroidvania games sets stage im always skeptical sequels one three things repeating original replacing original improvement trying make different never want game say one better comes masterpieces much fun game original fresh different story somber mechanics similar yet different one another finish yet realizing still invested end holy moly cant believe play almost perfect game every play little bit things dont like first glitch glitch occur next default button layout cuz time cause random thing dont want like grapple something else

rewarding lots skills use depending area youre fun heck play honestly leagues better first game took weaknessesshortcomings first game combat boss fights turned strengths platforming sections also forgiving arent gonna ginso tree pain progression much faster master movement abilities quickly graphics also got upgrade style still strong ost beautiful major thing completionists areas revisited

music graphics challenging soul destroying best feels really good play recommending game great sadness enjoyed mainly ori enjoy mechanics core mechanics felt like poorly engineered emergent gameplay making feel like bugs exploits times made difficult determine skill using progress area whether actually able oris current skillsetthe feel game even feel remotely similar ori since save system makes game absurdly easy actually regret playing hard mode played normal mode though buggy mechanics able tell strategy would work made game difficult enough example platforming ghost races extremely difficult times skills would sometimes activate properly one area would extremely sensitive another case main reason would recommend playing hard mode combat since incredibly cheesy boss fights took tries typical enemy nuisancethe charm system side quests interesting whole game reminded hollow knight ori still dont really know feel im expecting definitive edition release problemsbugs fixed rebuy kind regret buying gametldr game enigma wish could recommend yes buggy doesnt feel like ori probably rereleased definitive edition anyway play story maybe watch youtube lets play want play mechanics would recommend time guy gets emotional games game made cry touching story stunning visualsthis game must play really amazed story game graphics whole game story simply beautifuli supporting developers game amazing work bmasterpieceb really disapointed combatfocused boss battles platformingfocused gameplay anymore new systems feel like different game guess minority wanted gameplay first

much wish moon studios would make continuation side story similar aesthetics magic creatures handing spicy soup else would get etc games much appealing beginner art cuteness appreciator like however seem coming foreseeable future maybe replay game couple years conflicted writing review absolute fan first game make short loved first game probably buy prepared caveats listed otherwise probably dont unless ache metroidvania good somehow even better brilliant every still tight scenes touching enough make grown man tear upthe neutral memorable still follows pretty much exact recipe first one starts little slowerthe bad people experience many encountered small handful playthrough got pretty level design remarkably bad prepare get fuck supposed go next situation often main gripe game brilliant level design choices first game sequel fails even ok job making clear next proceed plot partially due somewhat confusing map screenori bllind forest succesful recipe metroidvania little linear focused platforming game basically much shorter hollow knight worse gameplay design choices overallonce looks amazing plays great times writing finish masterpiece musics gameplay story action especially boss fights incredible deserves money gave recommend everyone play game thank much moon studios beat blind forest day sad beat sad fun beautiful sort heavy sense perfect id recommend games anybody thanks

absolutely incredible game cant bring give game thumbs dont think deserves im still disappointed wotw maybe thats fault wanted fun owllight creature adventure sometimes often tedious execution platformer clunky controls end result even though theres abilities larger maps bunch boss fights still like first one betterso lets start good game looks great design unique environments best ive seen anywhere home base mechanic actually pretty fun collect loot help creatures map get stuff improve home settlement wotw great job predecessor really opening map go defeat dangers unlock new abilities map easier cross ways music really solid sound design general pretty good oh since im gonna call sand darkness traversal later credit credit due one fun water levels ive played mechanics played well probably best looking zone game pretty fun buti gripes quite actually game issues gate didnt ssd wouldnt played game installing standard hd played like garbage okay games running fine sound messed well computer speakers sound messed fix headphones fix everything mostly still crashed areaswhat controls well sometimes auto lock targeted abilities bit odd respond indicate itll something going press latchchargedo thing button thats much problem general platforming nightmare time trial escape sections vertical movement relation jumping targeted abilities extremely confusing jumping early lessen height things substantial amount like abilities mapped different buttons contextual shared abilities exercise frustration especially game puts one mess start scenarios lot look ive played super meatboy hollow knight games tightly controlled hard balance perform right actions controls enable wotw controls mess clutch hard even perform action youre trying abilities never used game meanwhile super important one sold vendor since missing abilities supposed know important one could leave rot put important one map dont miss itmap elements like sand darkness sections didnt really appeal either kind put game rails rather promote exploration yeah opens map sections get mileage youre clearing lot less revisit cant say really enjoyed themthey gave new fight controls really floaty everything air hard tell im hitting best way approach half enemies would make difference except combat pretty easy get halfway game yeah could crank hard mode wanted play againoh plot okayagain issue first one ending gets writers want doesnt really tell compelling story right moments pacing way used characters seemed contrived unnecessary say would spoil still dont like ori writingin end ori twice much needs dark cute fun lighthearted meticulously demanding difficult platforming easy boss fights massive number abilities half useful platformers much want execute well wotw lot things didnt really perfect guess okay great cant decide two games better game pretty much like first one good thing one however completionist friendly first managed get everything first playthroughthe ori games trurly masterpiece game always top games time cant describe amazing game everything gold story soundtrack course beautiful graphics absolutely loved playing game masterpiece cant even count many times ive listened soundtrack ori games gone visuals nevermind last month since played first one game first absolutely needed get able first one amazing second one didnt disappoint even bigger first much simpler terms story though less amazing adding multiple npcs side quests really help build world set mood felt boss encounters even fun though challenging including actual boss fights instead chasesthere also multiple mechanics really enjoyed game first almost didnt realize inconvenient things first ori started playing one saw changed everything feeling large part due player feedbackstory absolutely amazing heartwrenching almost moreso first feel course im judging fact game actually get cry last scene shriek killed impactful feel like game maybe didnt bittersweet overall absolutely loved itspirit trials worst least favorite thing game ever silent woods took probably least tries cant express enough game played anybody everybody experience art style music story absolutely stunning alone enough recommend game suggestion must play first game really feel connected characters understand going bit better environments music absolutely stunning times may find sitting admiring look soundtrack gameplay also amazing like platformers one smoothest controls platformer ever played well great explore included bunch new abilities well ones previous game make traversing environment fluent combat rehauled original game gives somewhat hollow knight vibe definitely better abilities homing attack bomb wisp first game mechanic replaced number different melee ranged attacks really lets play style bit also included similar system charm system hollow knight modify abilities like light bow get shoots arrows instead example damage increases also carried multiple difficulties allow different skill levels playthis game must play cant get beautiful game looks cant give game enough praise music gameplay storytelling beautiful aspects love platforming love ori cant put words awesome game really combat fun meaningful upgrade blind forest platformingmovement fluid satisfying fun levels beautiful npcs interesting well designed believable music killer especially boss fights took wonderful aspects blind forest expanded upon story always favorite part ori one disappoint im gonna lie got choked lot playthrough b overall ori wisps striking beautiful literally cannot put game definitely worth checking fan metroidvaniaesque games b cant put words amazing game much everything done perfectly combat never gets old always exciting puzzles always challenge huge intricate map character progression abilities story amazing pissed even side quests long story short youd dumb enjoy game definitely play watchplay ori blind forest first first game series cant recommend enough loved cant recommend ori games enough imaginative challenging emotional dramatic absolutely beautiful masterpieces far im concerned cant recommend game solely ive played first one standalone propably good game beginning noticed blatantly game rips plot first game establishing characters way felt emotional connection character game really really loved even villain first gameproslots cool puzzles movement options ori combat revamp combat never oris strong suit revamped feels lot refined still lacking behind metroidvanias like hollow knightactual bossfightsamazingly beautiful music visualsconsbad character developmentreused plot devices overall worse story first gamea lot gimmicky features like map trader basically useless get equivalent map exploring everything anyways timed parcour routes fun nothing meability powercreep spoileryou frequently get abilities make ones completely obsolete like tripple jump startdashspoilerkeep mind bad game still enjoyed playing recommend half time playing felt like reused content first game thinking playing visuals gameplay music definitely recommend game cant recommend game enough great game play story cant recommend game highly enough art story game mechanics amazing lot love went making game cant say enough positive things masterpiece game adventure whole way puts emotional roller coaster never seems end multiple moments game made cry something least makes game amazing im happy bought game dont regret slightest cannot express music heavenlyone best adventure metroidvania game cannot recommend game unfortunately love first ori would probably liked one could finish release issues lag sound patch fixed issues cannot finish game surprise surprise new game breaking bug wont waste another hours get part get bug really want game wait definitive addition cannot recommend game enough great metroidvania great story superb musicthe biggest con introduction many concepts hollow knight love hollow knight thats much problem really p cannot recommend game enough story gameplay art style pacing cannot recommend masterpeice enoughenough said cannot stress amazing game almost every way improvement first game including music little bumpy launch bugs irond since despite imperfections game serves great example incredible art direction emotional story writing jaw dropping music composition fun engaging gameplay wisps borrows number elements hollow knight also keeping fresh new metroid castlevania created metroidvania wisps fine tunes gives polish game incredible far favorite mine cannot understate amazing game game many things right ridiculous platforming probably best ive ever played bash mechanic especially wonderful thing come back first game ability bounce projectiles enemies klonoaesque works perfectly fluid gameplay ori combat surprisingly way better expected minor complaint bosses way tanky make hard get clobbered still major complaint since theyre still loads fun even new element game presents beyond last one oh word soundtrack amazing gareth coker best soundtrack least par superior blind forest story telling rams like arrow complex got really good like child watching disney film honestly id say ori even surpasses disney comparison could gush game would rather keep surprise anyone hasnt played masterpiece yet easily best game opinion cant believe amazing game played first one fantastic deep storyline many great twists bought hoping would match gameplay combat got better story tears beautiful sad time amazed good game havnt played havnt played first one get start cant give game enough ups insanely beautiful dont like game probably shouldnt play platformers metroidvania games ever cant stress enough good game ending still think even though finished game months ago game says life animals games movies people superior first far likely best game ever played completed game would say overall quite enjoyable somewhat challenging great art somewhat cliche story music overly emotional taste oris controls feel smooth thrilling moments overall prefer hollow knight ori ticks boxes average metroidvania fun time consider largely patient gamer occasionally buy games year release honestly much backlog theres rarely true sense urgency three one rule helping ease theres still far unplayed played column enjoyed ori blind forest enough though skip usual waiting period im really glad almost every respect much enjoyable game original ori blind forest already leapt way upper half personal top still improves upon remarkably solid bonesthe blind forest suffered pretty bad introductory hour two wisps doesnt get wall jumping pretty much right away double jump wall climb fun abilities introduced rapidly great effect id say actually solves problem fault get many abilities button slots assign natural synergies emerged blind forest lot clunkier ori loadout sorts means need choose three skills time awkward trip menu change means really want explore way chain things together end flowbreaking reliance ui guess blind forest required remember lot terms button combinations im convinced better approach also though im convinced worse given much improved flow ability acquisition wisps improves dramatically though one notable unbearably rageinducing exception chase sequences theyre shorter less mechanically complex generally feel considerably fairer original mean didnt end hating quite much one chase though aggravating dwarfs frustration anything blind forest play game youll know encounter excessive chases improved respect bringing boss battles contention really add dose innovation mechanics ori narrative pacing achieving key milestone play theyre fun kinetic offer lot opportunities use panoply skills upgrades bring foes slight problem wisps much combat oriented experience didnt really feel like thats ori needed best game enemies tools terrain exploited rather foes defeated combat satisfying dont get wrong enjoyed every moment exploring rich environments richly interweaving levels didnt need combat denser movement puzzles probably would better mewill wisps also noticeably ups production values graphically musically really im sure would believed realistically possible ori blind forest already visually stunning game id ever played yet wisps takes high watermark bashes airdash even higher reaches stunning every single level full backgrounds would happily hang wall animations baked terrain really push top like moving painting haunted soul orchestra reacts emotional visceral ways gorgeous movements ori real treat colours spectacularand ending hoo boy beautiful bittersweet emotionally cathartic way didnt expect tldr bit wisps phenomenal even emphasis gameplay changed still suffers obnoxious chases toolbox abilities hamstrung fact theyre hidden behind uiwonderful game overall though four half five stars could go great detail explaining pros cons think summed one sentencegame really amazing previous one couple improvements moment small bugs great could never thank friend enough gifting game art could recommend game music atmosphere alone gameplay solid boot improves everything blind forest incorporates better mechanics peers like hollow knight amazing experience could spend lot time writing game right amazing every aspect would faster watch trailers imagine game fun trailers look like still better expectationsi still tried write wall text erased think trailer looks sounds beautiful simply play game couldnt speak praise game finished hard mode yes one bosses quite dark soulsish hard game fantastic experience movement abilities make want pop relive fraction perfect adventure price id satisfied paid cried much expected towhat say except exceptionally good game welldeserving wonderful reputationfirstly story simply beautifully told twists characters make comback regardless lot new side characters introduced individuality even contribute little nothing story shows much love went thisthe music simply masterpiece atmospheric beautiful underlining scenes environments makes cry even harder respective scenescompared ori blind forest sequel captures gorgeous essence predecessor also builds gameplay different additional challenges boss fights amongst additionsits difficult adjust difficulty depending want challenge enjoy storywhile spirit challenges little annoying doableoverall gem amongst kind recommend everyone long take hit feels shedding tears cried beautiful didnt mean graphic cried every step story amazing gameplay many skills combo boss fights awesome

original top game breaking bugs preventing many others enjoying game enjoyed ori blind forest game admit might target demographic since style game actually something normally play really enjoyed first game found ori wisps frustrating due changes change allow kind manual save made unwelcome one sometimes found repeatedly struggling get past point without save location made experience feel repetitive repeat process second problem could change difficulty game played first game gave challenge able beat lot less frustration one may gameplay changed reduce focus platforming instead emphasis fighting boss fights fair realizing halfway im getting frustrated would like make things little easier kind bummer realize would either soldier start new game different difficulty setting negatives aside recognize issues may problem fans style game might actually positive game still beautiful heartfelt filled great music something would definitely recommend people enjoyed ori blind forest hesitated buy wisps therefore waited patiently bought game however finishing game ca hours hard mode say mistake went directly purchase game every penny worth beautyful design music amazing mechanics feel even better first part would recommend playing gamei encountered bugs none dramatic one first kind annoying boss fight second phase water rise happening respawning enjoyed honest prefer blind forest terms gameplay interesting npc characters good lot plus open world exploration feel collectibles im kind disappointed cant get without spirit trials cant time trials life depended chase sequences actually easier boss fights quite fun challenging enough ended getting lost several times though sometimes difficult tell ledge currently unreachable im terrible platformingthere graphic glitching audio syncing problems might due laptop exactly optimized gaming im willing let passcombat additions well see appeals people lack melee combat weapons wasnt much problem blind forest much fun bashing enemies around tossing projectiles back even throwing enemies directly spikewhich brings biggest complaint controlsthis may ive gotten used blind forest controls still someone enjoyed bashing enemies inclusion grapple importantly bound button bash complicated things often would try bash enemy get spikes thats often fastest satisfying way disposing grapple random blue flower didnt even notice grappling blue flower doesnt quite control bash bash pauses bit set direction grapple doesntanother complaint putting stick walls like toggle instead binding key like blind forest sometimes want stick wall sometimes dont esp frustrating say escape sequence inadvertently get stuck ledge wanted free fallalso might play style never really used half shards barely used non plot essential skills like boomerang sentry ended bit obsolete collected sake collecting itanyway liked preferred style story blind forest enjoyed playing game much happy see sequel first game ori blind forest excited see story continue let animation stunning first game audio matching songs match emotions tears flowing already ori blind forest suprise hard get engaged characters even villans playing game lovely experience

frustrated platforming caring combat first ori certain charm fluid pace sequel eschews combat unintuitively precise puzzle platforming every step way many times thought missing something important

besides respawning limited health cells please change bossfights annoyingyou get regeneration ability pretty quick game didnt pick endboss since missed somehow bosses easily manageable without well apart endboss phase think liked endboss since unique oh yeah boss attacks randomized fun boss attack impossible attack times row due bad rngthe actual boss design attacks mostly fine boss chases fine

already amazing world made better finished game say wow know lot people hesitant game quite changes mechanics game well im belief give chance find many changes quite charming ill try go changes pros cons without spoiling much first one major changes lack ability tree game opposed first game game gain abilities via trees similar previous game spirit shards differences abilities used time limited amount abilities equip using spirit shards might annoying found fun way sort sculpt game different play style amount shards equip goes play develop play style base mobility life gathering spirit light defence offence lot ways challenge build youre looking challengethis another way change play style suit person many different attack options gained used reliant one methodthe final differences mention challenges game ori faces many bosses form challenges challenges exactly challenge easier others meant carry form difficulty allowing utilize new abilities area found challenges fun find difficult given option abandoning challenge continuing rest gamenow things really start change game interaction creatures game many occupants forest able speak interact characters purchase additional abilities shards even maps originally wasnt sure felt change continued forward game found charmed adorable residents forest side quests sent werent obstructive actual game play felt like naturally mingled story quite lovelyso pros would definitely count differences pros game play managed pull away first game avoid copy still keeping charm ambience loved first gamejust like first game find wonderful soundtrack game new area enter met matching soundtrack ranges creepy peaceful solemn happy really feel atmosphere improves experience muchanother similarity first game wonderful graphics cut scenes actually get game game starts beautiful cinematic continues impress fact story beautiful first game find immersed game story cons amount soul light containers game provides like may like complete game completion finish side stuff well game would include purchases abilities shards upgrades associated maps upgrades well completed game normal difficulty even managed complete spirit races additional soul light another optional somewhat difficult task however still close soul light short able buy rest shard upgrades collectables already obtained option go back grind bit killing creatures get additional soul light needed previous game ended excess end game faced opposite game feel like needed extra light containers map players wouldnt feel frustrated fall short enough light end gameanother issue game still several bugs pc gamers effect immersion game play experience well know sound issues started game loud obtrusive buzzing sounds would completely ruin certain moments transferring file solid state disc found fewer obtrusive buzzing sounds still every instead would moments sound would cut second two every awhilei even glitch prevented using light burst properly shut game order fix noticed visual glitches nothing serious usually didnt take away actual game play itselfi also issue combat music continuing play area challenge despite challenge completed good music dont get wrong get annoying youre casually going area stuffas game recently released though hoping bugs glitches things fixed eventually though point definitely think ill jump game second play think ill wait id like much relaxing play without annoyance dealing bugsregardless bugs though still recommend game anyone played first game even havent although definitely recommend play first game beforehand better understanding loreand overall experiencethis beautiful game equally beautiful soundtrack adorable characters definitely game continue play future alongside first game finished game absolutely

finally play without noticing spent hours one sittingoverall love game might little bit biased first game one favorites far liked everything itthe visuals beautiful movement flows nicely combat tricky fun needs attention combat first game spammed left mouse keyi havent finished game yet cant wait discover story simply love like love whole life kind wish star rating personally enjoy game mildly takes lot features away hollow knight amazing thing enjoyed game personally like hollow knight regard highly suggest game really masterfully done congratulations creators honestly aware pc run however mildly heavier first ori know havent playing long would recommended game anyone first minutes alonethere words describe beautiful game brought tears several times virtue beauty staggering visuals transcendent music maybe thats needed something beautiful life right doesnt change amazing isi playing two hours already rapid approach becoming favorite game period good wondering game worth money answer would pay asking price see introduction first time againoh guess gameplay pretty good tooedit completed game second playthrough literally beautiful piece art ever experienced know people technical problems game ran fine one crash hour playthrough frequent autosaves wasnt big deal loved abilities platforming redesigned combat significant improvement previous title art music beautiful haunting though feel use much bloom lighting times story touching excellent game like game dont touch ground fun like didnt dislike anything product wonderful atmosphere incredible music astonishing graphics love every second like like added questing system little structure game without compromising style openness story exactly sequel like implemented way customize combat style spirit shards similar hollow knight mechanics great sequel great visuals great gameplay great story little short side still great like first game wont return game horrendously buggy many fps drops got ill rather wait fixed play right edit dont know update fixed issues caused adaptive resolution game semiplayable right idea turned reason default option enable adaptive resolution fucks pretty much everything upthe fps drops happening start number bugs fewer like crashes times force shut either ori stoped moving unable jump certain sectionsthe combat seems better unlike first game get useful perks start since theyre mostly ones first game feels lazy many useless perks number abilities equip limited retartedbut biggest problem definitely bugs cash grab feel game doubt anyone deny havent preorder single game years looks like would wise play games older year since games seem like always shipped half edit bugs gliches got worse later collectibles looked jarring story way worse first already genericly weaki really didnt enjoy time overall outside combat even though also limited pretty much aspects game downgrade first one really dont see much reason play like first game slightly better one good like game im glad developer managed keep quality high level nice music beautiful graphic storytelling smooth control give game highly recommended like product like game tobut play first game else wont make much sense like game entertaining like first ori still little buggy crashed ori glitched half dozen times would say going bother wait weeks patch playi find challenging ways easier others feel like story slightly redundant wont say dont want spoil despite feeling little redundant enjoyed game much far would say little taken hours get therethey changed abilities little bit way modular familiar hallow knight felt like modularity similar said wasnt fan hallow knights modularity feel balanced well means vary skills bit depending preferred style playi played first ori many times tell one fact bucks surprising feel like doesnt take terribly long get single play since play many times feel like good price point valuei would definitely recommend anyone enjoyed first ori enjoys game hallow knight hope enjoy much like game nice graphics nice soundtrack decent gameplay actually fixed stupid sand worm escape makes negative reviews rightly rage inducing impossible get without looking guides trying finally timed everything right got better second playthrough third try rather try like kind game really fantastic imaginative game superb graphics animation style excellent music cant wait enjoy liked ori blind forest never loved sequel however fixed pretty much minor problems first game added lot new stuff well changes ori become nearperfect experiencethe combat way fun one inclusion variety weapons though found bow conjunction spirit shards increased power probably strongest especially bosses bosses great though played hard difficulty better time think added challenge incentivized explore every nook cranny spirit shards health energy upgrades etc end collected everything game offer every quest completed construction gladebuilding glade also one favorite parts game loved creating glowing sanctuary middle oris dangerous unforgiving world really felt like helping characters within charming waysthe platforming always best part first game even better collect spirit shards gain methods traversal stay airborne quite use cleverlythe story sparse simple touching oris adoptive sister ku completely adorable unfortunately commission games length story beats revolving around ori family still effective especially opening ending scenes considering spoilerthe finale shows future seemingly distant oris family long passed seems like end storyspoiler id gladly play whatever comes next developers wotw orirelated liked everything game liked played game became one mother nature talked trees gave super powers liked story ending game liked first game lot find game much intersting liked game easy new players get graphics ambient invironmentartstyle absolute also great story though recommend playing first game one liked lot better first

story highcaliber music visuals two didnt improve already perfect loved ori blind forest sequel much familiar continuation blind forest better still goodi think went bit far trying reinvent wheel combat revamp isnt good mostly due inclusion collision damage bosses collision damage would made sense combat style blind forest retained mostly dealing damage somewhat distance thats case real interruption flow combat especially since major attacks dont require energy melee strikes modify position slightlyother everything loved blind forest cool art style good music good puzzles fun platforming loved ori blind forest sequel takes already awesome makes better every way longer emotional story even satisfying platforming new ways move dieit also adds actual bosses instead pitiful bosses blind forest npcs auto checkpoints running energy soul link completely redesigned combat feel less like spamming x button avoiding enemy attacksthe game looks sounds better ever godrays new colorful locations screen space reflections varying perspective cinematics instead new soundtrack gareth cokeri thought couldnt really get better original moon studios managed pull alienating veterans original game loved ori blind forest yet like wisps played continued wonder developers trying get bit hollow knight mojo adding similar sounding npcs either way newly added npcs dry boring im still dizzy rolling eyes friends first game return waste screen time barely anything useful story powerful creatures game equally useless especially frog wasted potential dark takes world everyone gets depressed hunkers die get wayoh yes gorgeous world like painting actually like one must spend time analyzing find things around know many times lost track ori attacking sword adds effects lose track close enemies bosses super colorful shake ground completely lose track ori far biggest grievance game crazy looks gorgeous wish could change color ori red something minor problem first game seriously annoyingori equipped lot abilities focused sword hammer sword best way go since works scenarios however ori never close combat character first game right oris movements invite precision found getting close enemies far seemingly right distance swinging ori would get closer get hit aimed arrows air ori stop air could aim correctly would slowly fall frequently got way first get cool looking abilities like spear cannot really use magic wastage completely forgot time enough magic hammer awesome slow use could make main weapon healing constant instead select time minor things made ride bumpy die often bothered clunky abilities fighting mechanics weremusic good level blind forests epic kuro boss fight hoped something epic story similar good lacks starting bad characters liked shriek kuro blind forest feel speciali see effort put game larger scope first feel higher quality alas work complete give fair chance replay blind forest although conclusion see others different perspective recommend discount loved ori blind forest aesthetic atmosphere music story incredible however without flaws good thing ori wisps fixes almost every issue first game improving upon aspects loved story amazing

amazing ive seen music graphics absolutely amazing addition got teary eyed first minutes like real man warned make sure run decent pc get good framerate harder previous one platformer doesnt mean run wonderfully everyones computer game gorgeous loved first game game pretty much still amazing level design art however maybe spoilers ending kinda pissed although feel like almost nobody else gonna

game far issues running either loved first one bought wisps immediately finishing blind forest thought lucky getting sale wish bought full priceim lost words great game ill try nonetheless simple straightforward story yet extremely touching combat platforming already excellent first taken notch several levels biggest change boss fights expectedly hard also diverse highly satisfying soundtrack brilliant replay since completing game negative think stutters frame rate drops experienced apparently fixed might alone however good sections game ran smoothlythis recommendation havent played first game even reading reviewsabsolutely recommend game would suggest playing first havent definitely enhance experience game loved first one far like first one better held weeks glitches performance issues right bat downloaded big patch today running flawlessly impressive heard loved first one really step far loved first ori game beautiful emotional innovative hollow knight released near comparisons inevitable however preferred ori due accessiblecoming current game world expanded became rich remains beautiful ever however cannot match predecessor terms emotion innovationthe first one introduced groundbreaking bash escape sequences cant say game try introduce bashburrow sand mechanic way late gamethe escape sequences become easier yes first one hard also gave immense satisfaction completed one time around last one sand worm presented considerable challenge rest pretty mehthere introduction combat variety however enemies pretty basic stick moves obviously focus ori games platforming however platforming game also pretty mediocre time around couple setups becoming challenging encounter towards endthe criticism seems lot first game piece art great gameplay still playable ever nothing attracts attentionif continue like cashing first game third game able succeed lot influences hollow knight imitation best form cartographer wish hadnt done took away npcs welcome touch made world health regeneration made game shards couple health regeneration choosing shard time made game incredibly easy normal difficulty able brute force even bosses fan first play second otherwise play ori blind forest first hollow knight next skip one loved game really builds ori blind forest started loved game much loved graphics beginning tutorial slow final boss say remember feather otherwise gonna angry definitly recommend game makes feel like really skilled little loved original even bought definitive edition almost right away released say excited sequel understatementso deliver absolutely dont quite know somehow managed described masterpiece managed pull sequel wonderfullywill wisps takes things everyone loved blind forest adds new things changes things keep fresh less expect good sequelthe story strong impactful previous although perhaps spends little time introducing world many features time around platforming also much satisfying enjoyable blind forest well arguably even moreso many refinements several returning game mechanics newly introduced onesto say thoroughly enjoyed game understatement regrets whatsoever paying full price im one people normally wait months even years get good deal gamesive seen people mention bugs personally havent encountered substantial ones cannot comment though notice select achievements mainly connected certain collectible items showed like minute two actually completed themso summarizemore less perfect sequel consider one alltime favorite games loved original game easily nervous going pull sequel fair mechanic changes like sort inventory system side quests currencystore system isnt microtransaction real money ingame system combat also reimagined sequel definitely adds lot way ori interacts progresses story let go gamegameplay soundmusic sequel outstanding good finished got chair gave standing ovation youre platformers metroidvanias need play loved original true masterpiece sequel ok bad game let compared exceptionally high bar set id give good graphics amazing stepped every inch every level brimming detail blends much better everything higher res far variation looks gorgeous boss fights overall better side quests nice additionand thats rest okaythe soundtrack amazing lackluster sequel bad memorable tracks reworks nothing new overall found boring doesnt evoke emotion still remember years later soundscape escaping ginso tree cant remember single track sequel finished like hours agowhile bash blast staple ori didnt like grapple far often wanted bash enemy would end pulling whole screen grapple point came fact grapple bash button annoying didnt even use grapple shard nearly every use grapple could replaced lantern projectile required bashing overly complicated movement reason apart need something new fortunately could ignoredavoided timethe sand dash really annoying overloading buttons mere excuse need something new whereas grapple annoying downright infuriating worm escape sequence frustrating enjoyed kuro escape sequence original enjoy challenge punishment missed sanddash ended normal dash pretty much meant shot wrong direction instantly died could normal ability could assign xyb could equip times sand rest game could swap ignore itlevel design felt poor many times unsure supposed somewhere needed ability many roadblocks could actually passed using clever jumpingbashing often found stuck places couldnt progress get indication poor playing unable reach place design never happened originalmany levels areas couldnt go without dying clear indicator spider level dont remember name particularly bad certain areas see fine magically explode reason without light mention perfectly visiblemany times found unsure something visual detail key point puzzle feeding grounds perfect example exceptionally frustrating background detail something need aware time found dying thought something part background wasnt viceversa glowing thing important yet another thing glows otherwise gorgeous landscape glowing thingsmost challenge game came defeating enemies platforming puzzle solving trying figure next basically trialanderror way game dying repeatedly fortunately spawn right back hard rarely found firstif jugglebash projectiles multiple times row put ceiling mere inches baurs reach horrible every waythe storyline dumb deformed armored transformer bird somehow magically fly kuro far intimidating interesting wishing ku would die dumb birdthe controller support infuriatingly buggy loved soul links first game cant help feel

abilities collecting shards equipped depending many slots unlocked unlock extra slots completing combat shrines lot fun though arent difficult addition combat shrines also complete time trial shrines really test platforming skills quite difficult took many attempts complete lastly game offers quests net spirit energy use currency shards active skills complete game longer first includes main quest got lot enjoyment one difficulty starts bit easier first game later offers roughly challenge though noticed werent many instantdeath moments first game doesnt allow create save point however remains

environments advantage bstoryb cant really talk much gist ori ku owlette flown new region niwen encounters dying island ori save land stem flow corruption whilst simple premise journey along way really makes strong point game wonderful references first game look hard enough bmusicb wonderfully composed orchestral soundtrack gareth coker seriously take listen one best video game soundtracks

visuals pure eyecandy sound track great really enjoyed game think blends good story great artwork visualy musicaly fluid natural movement combat mechanics make supurb experienceone nitpick sandworm boss could use savepoint seem graphicaly demanding needs think theyre rendering everything objects nessesary perhaps couldve done prerendered animations prerendered cutscenes could run lesser computers im developer knowregardless small complaints definatley worth full price really fun game lots find touching story well really like combat system game smooth like really like story moving combination game would strongly recommend people like solve puzzles really like game crashes oftenplease fix soon really like game please fix bug thank really like game metroidvania classic ways exploration somewhat linear cant really stray path meant played sequel much different first game graphics still awesome music breathtaking gameplay great yet still lacks something really like going much fun really liked blind forest wisps makes difficult return predecessor ori controls like dream especially equipped numerous upgrades make travelling even fun combined gorgeous visuals beautiful soundtrack musthave fans metroidvania easy contender personal favourite game year really liked least good first game mechanics gameplay elements working nicely level design liked first one recommend second part well really liked first one adoption hollow knight customization better first say least really liked games combat mechanics beautiful art story overly complicated refreshing ive blast way worm escape sequence almost impossible beat im hopeful moon studios balance sequence make actually beatable overall ive enjoyable time playing game would recommend really liked new skills features especially mini games skill shard system allows great variety individualization might come handy comes speedrunning parts escape sequences felt pretty precise appropriate beautiful opinion worthy sequel think everyone loved ori blind forest love game well everyone freshly stumbles ori universe fall love immediately really liked game feel lot like original times however times felt like game trying little hard like hollow knight iteration ori significantly higher level combat previous game isnt well balanced addition felt like lot ideas thrown game sake namely collectables dont seem much thing game short really enjoyed game higher level difficulty platforming sections even higher levels mobility wont see game would personally play original first pay extra dollars play one really love hollow knight really love story way game build soundtrack hits perfect game absolutely really love first one good better filled challenges exciting enjoy first one sure love game well highly recommend everyone enjoys advantage style games anyone played first must play game really love game sadly laptop spec almost cant hold recommended really miss puzzles first game still puzzles seem watered lot involve platforming skills apposed pure thinking game beautiful like first game noticeable blurry blockyness background sometimes rather jarring running game fantastic good first game still good thoughi thought new weapons cool almost never used seemed pretty useless used sword hammer spear almost exclusively also switching weapons couldve done better thinkthe lack skill tree imo best move use bunch slots basic abilities like third jump kinda felt like got cheated understand itthere bugs around quest markers disappearing completion pickups respawning cannot pick also got stuck reload previous save avoid area completely later gameoverall game excellent followup previous ori really really love game really recommend game story line graphics feelings occured playing game unbearable obviously minuses expect arent honest someone would like play definetly buy also blind forest know whole context enjoy even moreapart really wanted tell changed life many ways first joining whole ori fandom community felt like finally found happiness life moreover managed meet great people also created version spirit commissioned various artists make results incredibleto sum everything opinion must game beautifully made well worth price really want like game really doori blind forest masterpiece patient enough wait definitive version could play best loved game cried much story enjoyed

intended please keep us apprised performance issues fixed expect able experience game meant experienced really want like game really want complete fun like first one consider one favorite metroidvanias problem lost identity ori game point proceeds try live predecessormy primary issue game abandoned much made first ori fun instead tried hard fit stereotypes modern metroidvania added combat keeping oris slippery graceful movement beautiful ends frustrating fun savestates removed return forced combat bosses dont feel fun ori doesnt dodge iframes game tries way hard different metroidvania primarily hollow knight yet clings tightly original ideas ori makes fun enjoy feeling running gliding around ori world dangerous trappuzzle ridden actually fun really want love game theyre done patching runs smoothly probably stands slogged hours buggy platforming cutscenes absolutely breathtaking truly ori franchise masterful art music composition storytelling jittery mess witnessed enough make cry even graphics lowest settings case thats problem even restart yes killed final boss twice see would improve final quality cutscene frustration entails see astonishingly beautiful game trying dont recommend game yet devs clearly love though give month three fix issues game perform supposed ill get back really want recommend game cannot game still issues risk softlocks sound stutters furthermore found story less compelling also think character models dont look nice environment game still beautiful nice extra features like ori something otherwise would recommend wait patches really wanted love game really unfortunately suffers fate sequel movie loved story formula wont spoil anything youll see changed game mechanics basically stole hollow knight shards shops upgrades npcs map guy etc addition npcs around maps utilised anywhere near potential thus waste time interacting like wtf point bird guy improvement combat sad true still good game compared last masterpiecethe devs took lazy approach feel really wish could give game positive review doesnt workby mean upon reaching certain point game computer overheated due graphical stress turning settings makes differencei potato pc play games like valorant overwatch rocket league league legends without even worrying graphics settings ive played many platformers past celeste hollow knight neither problem frankly look better game id give reason expect game causing even looked minimum specs wouldnt educated computer let repeat absolutely cannot run game meets specsif computer isnt fair bit specs

hollow knight combat one fun unlike first ori game click mouse furiously actual bosses one movement fluent fun story magnificent shed tear technicall issues expirienced lot sound errors probably fixed clipped trough floor visual bugs like teleport animation plays twice minor ones big step original means double masterpiece thus gets saw recommendation first game series aesthetic looked appealing saw

previous masterpiece graphics upgraded another peak could hardly reach music brings dream world wonder several years ago exciting part new weapon system evolves ori real warrior master martial art story love idea loop fate warm shelter dangerous forest much easier horrible silver tree moon studio deserves name masterhowever something lost untold new scenario didnt bring affection much previous one even simple tale well developed complete frame whole world figured nothing origin evil spirit corrupt water clear view sandworm think background complemented side quests graphics ending though epic enough unforgettable abrupt somehow unreasonable mean develop theme life death love requires much cushions close bond characters linked say ori wisps one greatest games alive satisfy expectation flaws plots unfortunately pity masterpiece still recommend stumbled game discovery queue immediately interested especially reading reviews game let beautifully made vibrant graphics really made side scroller come alive music everyone says amazing story brought tears multiple points ending story made actually cry husband laughing game really sucked hard put game play challenging best way really think try lot different things certain points get lucky continue one best games spent money long time worth every penny think going jump back time play first game duo next think know everyone cries play game freaking hardits difficult imagine perfect game ori blind forest getting better somehow moon studios ityou need play ori games incredibly rare find story told heart coupled gameplay constantly challenging youthis series remind reasons love video gamesjust buy think im person saying prefer original first foremost combat game feels like attempt adding depth however navigating weapon use battle often hampers pace especially apparent fighting boss want switch weapons pause chose weapon ability button want use actual combat feels disjointed likely either spam abilities dodge isnt much room aggressive result variety combat focused looks compared feels animations swinging lightsaber supposed faster weapon long liking compare game like hollow knight combat much fluid fast paced need remember switch weapon abilities also much depth despite using sword nail spells charms ori charmlike system really change play game much hollow knight ori might get spirit shard changes weapon works hollow knights charms allow stand still swinging nail changes health bar entirely even give pets aid combat game best makes think best weapon use given moment part game stops wanting play also problem minutes one keystones wasnt loading reload saves found understand seems like negative review actually enjoy game visually stunning sound design music also great movement far best part game fluid also keep mind ive playing hours first impressions rather review might play dont know anyways dont let stop buying game described scares want get game buy keep mind probably experience rather games fault yeah thats first maybe last impressions game id give might seem kinda low keep mind still opinion quality game worth time kinda reviewed game bored share thoughts since game flaws conclusion like see go get first impressions think great improvement first one combat system first needed bit getting used much prefer old one think easily one best games played long time long time since got invested game trying best search every nook cranny possible till achieved man feel good theres much sequel better first game absolutely beautiful music gorgeous visuals fluid gameplay biggest improvement might add making wonderful experience beginning endthe thing really holding back absolute masterpiece would couple bugs technical issues would pop though often easy forget indulging every aspect game think best describe compared first one havent played first game ori blind forest highly recommend wont miss story per say expand moveset learned throughout gamethe score new yet familiar still best ive ever heard gamethe game tiny bit shorter easier hard tell might im use bash mechanic introduced first gamethey added seems like double cut scenes story rich compared

trials seem optional think first one better daughter loves liked first one youll like get repetitive bad could lot better seeing good first one think sequel heavily inspired hollow knightand thats great visual music combat gameplay topnotchbut story little weaker mespoilerspoiler hate ending tho spoiler thought would never enjoy platformer many years playing games saw many glowing reviews give ori try im glad game truly something special interested enough reading review go ahead get thought wouldnt like game im much platformers game absolutely amazing ive played games one best games ive

ori wisps proved wrong great game nephew also enjoyed thought original ori pretty good ori wisps tried hard love game much loved first canti still recommend hard decision give thumbs upwhy soit many things right like first game graphics sound athmosphere level design spot always want continue figure progress get around next obstacleand thats exactly game fails sometimes gets seriously frustrating never blamed first one mistake ive made lot one controls far dont feel precise fights pure button mashing luck slots different abilities attacks may nice shooters dont think concept suits ori game well neither trading side questsit would nice kept game simple first thing leave open world elements outall lot fun sadly also quite frustration end theres sadly one verdict dont think im ever going play played first part least three times doesnt offer much fun thats struggled give thumbs without really thinking itabout bugs encountered handful glitches along way never came across something seriously bad effect something like thatim looking forward seeing moon studios hopefully go back roots keep simply fun typically dont like platformers one gets absolutely worth price probably fun ive game whilealso soundtrack fking amazing usually dont write reviews given enjoyment game would like make one support developers bit maybe help people decide would like experience game hopefully find

since feels like hollow knight ori thats good place wasnt aware possible get prettier ori blind forest legitimately dont think theres game pretty one jaw droppingly beautiful one games along hollow knight blind forest would present average person say games art really cannot overstate beautiful game isits platforming tight first game favorite mechanics made back amazing bash new abilities slouch either interestingly shares mechanics hollow knight shards lot like charms hollow knight combat wise ori took multiple levels badass able fight weapons made lightmuch like first game tissues standby must soul crushingly sad game points overall havent bought yet wasnt expecting game well developed along graphics price point definitely worth every dollar spent wasnt expecting game good blind forests original release solid felt like missing something adding laser swords huge hammers making combat suck less making game even silky smooth patch really boosted impressions game game took away awe doom eternal good worth double dip xbox version wasnt sure going improve upon formula original basically took everything loved game music art style fluid platforming cranked took stuff didnt love

first game made better went back boatbfb boatbf deb preparation sequel far probably greatest sequel video game ive ever played ihow much enjoy game incomprehensible highly suggest get game liked predecessor iuin honesty menus freaking pretty lot genuine fun watch slowly fill game progresses u ithis prime single player experience went expecting jolly good time game slapped feels definitely recommend anyone wants go short rich story simply say better first one even possible amazing game skip obvious mean see game gorgeous fluid constantly motion everything also hear amazing music played first one know well story triggers full range emotions anything done even better artistic masterpiece obvious pretty much anybodyhowever game would like talk gameplay game simply feels good every moment spent playing ori pure enjoyment fluidity controls matches nimble main character leaves feeling like b b one soaring magical forest combat step previous game orders magnitude beat game hours since done lot playthroughs form relaxation game difficult times unfairly extremely fun playas sequel game builds already impressive makes bigger better every wayso wandering worth hesitate undoubtedly piece art also core amazing game wish could like really many people love see hadnt sold first one decided go ahead try anyway since heard improved much got sale unfortunately misses mark methe things lovethe controls amazing love ori moves fluid responsive really joy run jump around without slowing especially get couple abilities make much funthe visuals beautiful love art style used really whimsical really feeds worlds wondersunfortunately thats kinda stops mefirstly combat theres lot youd think shouldnt issue much walk screen come back enemy killed back plain nuisance wouldnt problem combat even enjoyable isnt button mashing isnt funsecondly gameplay boring never ending running back forth even actually puzzles painfully tedious trudging back forth plain isnt fun especially paired boring also tedious combatthirdly story really isnt much one know im playing blind since played minutes first im pretty sure decent enough idea story regardless bad normally would totally acceptable paired otherwise boring game play cant hold upoverall whenever pick play feel bored like im trying push ahead see anything interesting happen never doesim far feel like im enough hours interesting nowi spent money dont waste game im going keep playing itbut honestly would wait till least buying wish didnt job wish could home day nothing play oh wait wont spoil anything might interested game beautiful story twist end perfect wisps almost perfect sequel ori blind forest theres lot emotional parts game admit teared several times throughout game plan playing must play game sure play first moon studios please make beautiful games like would highly recommend game anyone like metroidvania style games platformers story interesting art amazing great game expands gameplay original still making everything encounter feel fresh fun go literally played game strait days would highly recommend play game well done stand alone first game ori blind forest ori wisps forever hold special place heart became favorite video games ever playthe thing wish changed weapon selection mechanic didnt pause game rather ran slow motion would say wish hollow knight silksong would sequel good game first ori game would like developer pat back creation masterpiece would recommend playing first game one although first ones combat might tad bit clunky one arguably fixed combat system similar hollow knight despite changed art style amazing movement game feels different slightly less emphasis though increase combat game amazing definitely worth buy especially enjoyed first one would say outset part games would make smash controller boss fights arent especially difficult platforming sections genuinely infuriating also feel blind forest better save game system checkpoint system really helpful certain sections said still enjoyed finished game improvement many ways combat oris movements really melded art level design music really strong games match level refinement fondest memories game exploring around map payoff completing certain sidequests ending really controversial seems really liked way ended heartbreaking wrenching see end surprised story general pretty grim despite colorful gorgeous art design cant recommend enough never play platformers glad play game id give game game good bit combat focused previous one new story beats took hours first playthrough tried thorough glitch rendered sidequest unbeatable also couple minor glitches found funny entering certain cutscene air launching ori map randomly launched back liked first one wanted bit go wanted bit combat beautiful art style definitely go ill returning isnt fixed soonwhythe sound absent game keeps crashing workarounds expensive best crapshootdont blow money something doesnt work delayed releasegive follow wait hang money ifwhen fix get ive doubt actually playable itll wonderful experience mean sequel blind forest ill give hatchet honey reviewthe cons framerate stuttering high end gaming pc brush demands games requirements shoulders like dust luckily im experiencing plethora bugs negative reviews claim getting guess im either lucky one sideperks high end pc less chance bugsthe pros im hour half soundtrack already bringing tear eye quality first game top notch probably going top contender goty ill start two important disclaimers first technical issues faced decently long ordeal even get work first patch didnt work desktop pc update reinstall finally works moreover laptop ramhdd game still unplayably stuttery beta branch first patch even though patch reported improve stutter issues personally suspect main culprit drive machines slow hdds run greater risk unplayable experience thankfully least specific issue obvious right start refunding possibility youre stuck note though major issues got game work enough smaller reports issues may worth waiting patches game isnt high priority youfor second disclaimer heavily heavily spoil first game ori blind forest pretty much already first two minutes blind forest also great game havent played yet wish play games go blind forest firstwith way game platformingheavy metroidvania main appeal ori series lies two fundamental pillars first pillar games ungodly good art sound metroidvania im aware comes even close art quality prequel games supported emotional orchestral soundtrack top tier among games ive playedthe second pillar appeal sheer movement ability playable character gone even sequel already couple hours game platforming abilities top speed would feel absurd platformers capable player fly screens unimaginable pace retaining control speeds tough every misstep momentarily stops pace game essence dares see fast move tools gives youfor sequel changed obvious point combat combat rather simple first game sequel attempted make indepth still although combat parts indeed far better still clearly secondary compared platforming component terms enjoyment major change theres far npc interaction sidequests well far nonlinearity freedom exploration compared first game especially latter half game also far prefer story sequel first game point may divisive among peopleoverall game essentially mechanically improved blind forest already topnotch game begin ill write longer review later sum fantastic game sequel im fan original definitely delivers larger world lots fun characters good story overhauled upgrade system think really nice also nice game actually marks collectables youve seen cant yet getive ran number bugs nothing game breaking well without restarting client maybe

keyboard boys gals save controllers console buddies im still killing moves without issue nitpick thus far hit rather early tell short hours new characters ori blind forest left feeling really alone despair hope real one fact could almost called ori friends encounter numerous creatures inhabitants communicate constantly selling upgrades others passing items pass others quite often guess dont mind

atmospheric sequences lot tear heartstrings also love color scheme uses art style beautiful great job ori stand everything game rewarding exploring hidden partsso far story scenery soundtrack go game done deal gripes genuinely hope ever make another type game least builds aspectsso energy currency pretty much worthless would go upgrade abilities ended left end game didnt really rely feel something useful got set got comfortable really much incentive try something new something needed think could implement complex upgrade system think pretty good job abilities could use throughout game really nice end could really reap reward using different types specific scenario something really irritated boss fight save much progress make pretty much nonexistent especially brutal escape worm spam ctrl like hundred times kept making end dying start way beginning extremely frustrating hope implement type save point bosses get aspect fight realize take pride accomplishing end boss fight hard work put save points make fight seem cheap honestly got super annoyed monotonous fight scenario dozens timesoverall one favorite games played long time glad experience would recommend bored enjoy platformers

wisps beautiful art work music great story line others said one masterpieces game play builds blind forest ori new abilities character controls add experience levels boss fights challenging satisfying complete like ori blind forest worthwhile purchase im far halfway game really enjoying itpros beautiful graphics engaging game play good music better difficultycons particularly happy change action key action previous game different key action doable lb quite lot difficulty retraining muscle memory press one related game play unable log xbox account within game glitch keyboard doesnt work inputting usernamei nothing say kudos developers team another beautiful game like ori beautiful awesome game much hollow knight cannot go wronghard mode made sweat expected enjoyable experiencebring switch port ill buy doubt like first game sound design art story music settings spectacular feel like level design also seen quite improvement predecessor overall however disappointed game also carries highlights flaws previous game faced become especially clear boss fight startsthese issues think boil unfair hits player takes various circumstancesi feel like granular hp system part fault hp doesnt feel significant lose clipping edge spike hitbox respawning two minutes progress lost think even granular system would much forgiving bosses didnt also deal quarter hp random contact damage didnt hitboxes active attack phase transitions since bosses massive complex hitbox shapes often found incredibly difficult gauge location happened bit close boss would decide take unprompted step forward without giving time react eternally grateful generous checkpoint system boss fights allowed beat hour eachthe boss doesnt feature checkpoints deals lot contact damage quick attacks short telegraphs boss luma pools near end ended beating first phase flawlessly almost every time end dying attacks barely able read second phase boss cornered would often take two three hits normal mode imagine devastating blow hard mode outright kills runalso returning first game chase sequences think sequences best part first game mostly holds true well chases luma pools unfortunatelynotafulldungeon area desert feature couple instances fast scrolling becomes difficult parse whats ahead often repeat majority chase get another shot area im sure best way fix desert chase instances often came camera scrolling things onscreen comparatively late moving vertically instance luma pools also one player asked move vertically upwardsi hope whatever next game make feature generous hitboxes make segments game feel fair players easily able rely skill ought also satisfying player tackle difficult challenges generous hitbox doesnt even make game easier overallone last thing personal wish series feel like theres bit disconnect oris world layout levels area feels like designed linear dungeon often think makes traversing area dull formula extremely predictable zeldadungeonesque wish game would commit hollow knight side metroidvania individual areas may tightly designed instead feature multiple paths new areas introduced dont always feature plotcritical item may otherwise relevant traverse order get another area may something interesting feel like would help games feel like adventure checklist preserves sense wonder looking macguffin x player finds something maybe even interesting wellspring glades couldve exciting area come across pure accident exploring instance initially thought thats proceeded warp somewhere else start game thinking path onwards wasnt wellspring glades alasall definitly highclass nitpicking single individual hope take things account would really love able fully enjoy games even theyre giving escape sequences like first game ori delivers stunning music lovely graphics story line leaves tears eyes levels challenges well balanced thought new world explore music sweeps away well worth wait hope rumours true games works world like predecessor ori wisps nothing short work art would recommend someone definitely play first game trying however people fans first game might surprised find wisps simple platformer blind forest wasimproved combatchallenging satisfying fair platformingbeautiful visuallybeautiful make u cri like predecessor ori wisps absolutely gorgeous game delight playthe combat completely overhauled actually boss fights alongside classic escape sections prevous gameit simply great game play explore check one like predecessor great game like predecessor truly outstanding game visuals

exception wisps wotw took concept blind forest bf added new stuff notably focus combat player choices customization instead set skill tree player chose abilities passive bonuses plethora options either found bought throughout gamepeople call wisps unquestionable improvement blind forest tend disagree different refreshing flaws brought precisely changes course doesnt mean bad game list many active abilities bf made full use gamepad make abilities usable times wotw way many options make possible instead often ended browsing skill menu usually combat breaks gameflow stands contrast otherwise fluid gameplay choices felt meaningless slots passive abilities highly limited first half game one weary pick depending playstyle abilities clearly better others choice first place course aware players value different abilities purpose still feels uninteresting discovering new stuff often felt disappointing due limits mentioned previous point hurray yet another ability im never going use flat difficulty curve feeling progression halfway game player order want proceed area accessable unlike linear game also means however gradual difficulty possible area gets gradually challenging get one new ability required progress way bit zeldaesque items found incorporated specific area never used afterwards works fine first maybe second area player visits feels boring afterwards doesnt help point game player access movement tools meaning platforming challenges peaked point storywise progression didnt feel impactful clearing sections bf huge impact rest map felt something accomplished wotw yet another boss slain listin opinion compared bf story less enthralling immersive villain less relatable music albeit beautiful less memorablestill overall game masterpiece things mentioned pale compared things good great even liked previous game also like one like part oneone best games ever played pure love like ori games visual treat music also amazing expected various addition npcs welcome upgrade type game environments doesnt deviate much saw game breathtaking look calming needed also turn quickly nerve racking affair wants ive died times due environment enemies like game feel platforming section wasnt well thought needed memorization layoutmap rather reactive decision games best played controller games addition quests sidequest another welcoming affair turned metroidvania type platformer game sidescrolling action adventure game npcs also fun interact although sidequest ones end automatically without even accepting quest hand need players attention though game also added optional challenge sections time around combat trials multiple waves normal hard enemies spawns like survivalhorde mode platforming race challenge various spots map game also improved combat system significantly adding melee attacking options aerial combat main deal time around also juggle enemies combos unlock enough abilities quickly swap back forth auto attacking wisp game isnt available beginning youll however unlock sort similar auto attacking ability later game doesnt function game especially considering new aggressive enemies game improved rpg aspects game adding ability upgrades slots equip abilities time quickly swapped even combat also equip ability modifiers would either improve chances survival make harder turn game even challenging enemies significantly improved time around harder expected comes multiples enemy projectiles track player lot game arnt many boss fights game indeed atleast goodworthy bossfight isnt usual ori style runawayandsurvive sort stuff lot waterrun section game straight frustrating spoilerespecially final onespoiler breeze go fingers quick react stuff story bit led towards half especially ending might

really complete thats shamethe sound design wonderful evocative many places explore niwen beats tempo battles seamlessly numerous soundtracks area scene one flowing one next feels like music always perfect moment inthe controls tight intuitive ori reacts inputs controls feels responsive arguably platformers defined controls easy make difficult things game ori well every new move added feeling like natural addition list perfect abilities allow creative way acquire collectibles throughout gamethe artwork beautiful could sit appreciate every area several hours literally many layers scene many little details one purposefully done knit together entire back foreground first second games done excellent job melding gameplay environment terrain changing boss scenes changes actively incorporated ever increasing platforming challenges feels natural purposefulthe story great one didnt expect drawn quickly invested much expected tropes didnt see coming one way another elicited emotional response mein opinion ori wisps outdone every component game design made blind forest phenomenal see review oatbfdewhen worksthere constant sound glitches traverse game sound cutting general area transitions boss fights incredibly disruptive game experience heavily relies sound design order draw player keep investedless disruptive still issue shear number places gotten ori stuck map trying platform reach item developers platforming games expect players go explore every inch map always one player finds every hold map every glitch never cover every hole something developer goes knowing may happen issue im looking errors playing games issues occur getting stuck map isnt terrible issue fact quite humorous sometimes issue entire screen goes black middle platforming eventthese minor things continued progress enjoy game really bothered overall fantastic experience game highly recommend one genre defining games man oh man game first one excellent ori wisps topped even thatthe artwork phenomenal soundtrack excellent gameplay super fun interesting new skills memorable boss fights course story line stellar againive finished immediately want start play likely times like predecessorif youre fan beautiful funbutchallenging platformer great soundtrack definitely wont disappointed man game thing beautythe controls really tight well done story makes great sequel blind forest team still knows thoroughly kick feels absolutely playing platforming movement easy learn difficult master never really feels unfair recommend gamepad fast jumps floats dashes bashes keyboard serves fineside note

brevity sake one rare sequels manages better original almost every way see review ori blind forest thoughts original basic formula first ori game hasnt altered much still platformer metroidvanialike world said almost every aspect original game refined waymovement much options added top ori gives almost every ability got ori right beginning builds results wonderfully advanced platforming segments later upgrades bit soandso others awesome additions oris repertoire combat received biggest upgrade ori didnt really combat system much single button could spam attacks interesting aspect system tied movement options able bash enemies getting double jump back still air ori takes pretty much movement abilities adds actual combat system top including multiple melee ranged options targeted attacks much feels way better ori integrates wonderfully movement flow gamein addition theres passive abilities called shards found world cool reward tend pick favourites stick also huge quality life improvements jump stick walls enemy drops magnet biggest offenders feel like people always equipped imo way convert true passives somehowthe real gripe game story sort central hub help rebuild using collectibles found world also find several npcs shopkeepers talk like addition makes world niwen feel alive compared rather static nibel robs game predecessors magicfairytalelike feeling made much worse ending game wont discuss reddit post spoiler warning url summarizes feelings almost perfectly exception point said minor complaint doesnt take away much game overalloverall ori wisps brilliant game cant recommend enough ori wisps game tried hard like hollow knightspoilers aheadwhen halfway game already knew disappointed didnt really like completed normal mode still cannot recommend itthis means bad game despite bugs ori getting stuck rubberbanding spoilerand think glitched last phase last boss complete without really something ideaspoilerwhat dont like trying hard fit much stuff possibly many abilities skills sockets melee combat long bossfights multiple phases escapes chases feel like lot copied hollow knight game love dont get wrong combat incredibly similar socket system shards exact samethe bossfights phases also nothing new youve played metroidvania games know cant reinvent wheel first game perfect thing felt like first ori game general movement ori platforming escape partshell even part story similar hollow knight spoilerthe decay either kills makes attack others like miners desertspoilerspeaking escape spoilersandwormspoiler worst thing ive ever done dont know developer thought good idea add unforgiving escape lasts almost one half minutes uses clunky bad mechanic glitches lot top checkpoints completing didnt even feel good hands shaking mad game needed break despite fact managed within trieswhat like though storytelling story okayish didnt like ending new characters sidequests also graphics absolutely stunning honestly didnt expect anything else matterif love ori blind forest way play first game skip one owl hatched adorable heck thats matters ori wisps review combatthe combat big improvement last game expansive interesting could access lots different abilities one time felt relatively distinct could choose specific play style enemies unfortunately less interesting mostly reskins enemies area fought one group monsters basically fought movementmoving felt ways restricted many ways much free previous game types movement gliding given relatively early nice indications like bash dash stuff much better signposted game often actually knew could situation various race type games could play unfortunately problem demanded extremely precise jumps many cases extremely frustrating slightest mistake meant would start difficulty races disproportionately harder rest game map travelim sure game map felt much less linear previous game actually enjoyed lot previous game felt like went someplace got ability backtrack way back kinds things game much freedom movement could go places map relatively early could teleport one campsites wherever moving around map felt much nicer designin every way music visuals game noticeably better previous game music worked extremely nice listen set appropriate mood similarly visuals much interesting dark places felt much creepy pretty areas extremely beautiful despite relatively similar type game area barring final area felt different previous game felt fresh character storyin game much heavier story characters wonderful fact could quests sheer number people could talk meant world felt much fleshed similarly progressed campaign interactions actually changed completed objectives feel much dynamic less static amount new lore learnt backstory even surprise end really good engaging quests particular particularly interesting mainly fetch quests still nice addition problemsunfortunately game rather major problem one far far worse anything previous game game extremely laggy pretty sure laggiest game played recent memory possibly ever sound frequently bugged made buzzing noise frame rates many points single digits every time teleported campsite took minutes game able play smoothly final cutscene every boss battle fact completely ruined stuttery lag spoilt game sheer frustration caused without lag id rate game lag give mosta minor problem mentioned previously also fact final area felt similar final area previous game conclusioni really want rate game highly visuals story music everything felt like improvement previous game original problems first game felt like dealt unfortunately lag completely ruined experience didnt enjoy game nearly much really would dont lag would highly recommend game lag good luck ill say ori wisps soundtrackmora decided reincarnate beethoven real though game worth even musicps ku best existence would anything ori wisps addresses every criticism personally first game despite pretty heartfelt felt pretty lackingas soon starts game starts plucking heartstrings sets unique gameplay rich world deserves mantle best b platformer metroidvania b market right story fulfilling music grandiose animationcontrol mechanic smooth jazz every levelregion map memorable specific palette gameplay challenges world building better though along lines hollow knight game excels offering fluidity moment moment enjoyment pushing narrative rather bog repetition speaking hollow knight moon studios seem pretty inspired neighbour team cherry charm system map progression certain elements successfully integrated game provides far better experience expanded gameplay options hand unique feature ori implements well responsive weapon wheel diverse selection weapons time around switching around fluid control animation scheme midst battle blast weapons op af would advise everyone try least weapons also useful navigation purposes game often encourages breaking progression weapon combos jumps early parts another new feature vast selection side quests pretty sweet endearing never intrusivesuffice say game looks breathtaking best graphics media experienced period region distinct pretty also gameplay quirks mostly associated puzzles barring puzzles pretty simple never break flow prepare cry ori wisps blows predecessor water launches fing sun everything hated first game gone longer ori use feeble ball light attack enemies longer saving

supposed reach yet still accessed using skills available creatively great felt could rewards actually thisthe main difference new ori game last one combat big part experience overall think combat fluid works well though also feel like oris movement generally suited platforming oris options combat arent well defined also feel like combat part game doesnt emanate charm much everything else bit generic also enemy variety limited lots recolours hence combat suffers bitmy prominent gripes ori performance firstly crappy pc like going struggle keep lots crashes frame drops audio problems expected unless beefy computer personally using task manager quit game became procedural second lot bugs annoyingly controls default keyboard controls dont work changing causes random issues meaning actually creating setup struggle eg grab button isnt glide button grabbing wont work something figure trial errorone criticism grapple move terrible dont actually aim makes boring use also makes

contain spoilersprosart music sound design game superb level quality best seen video games makes game completely stand provide immersive experience beyond anything provided games price point goty quality respecta decent metroidvania pull heartstrings start game mostly end generally good things say gameplay combat completely boring extremely easy yet tight platforming mechanics surely appeal casual gamer likely playing game normal difficulty sequel immensely successful oribf people seeking story around ori happy see however think fact sequel contextualise reviewsconsi thinking game since completed much hate need inform people reading reviews shortcomings gamethe glaring issue game unfinished state technical level completely riddled bugs best destroy immersion worst make sections game unplayable cant believe game made beta testing stage honestly feels like never leftit comes across extremely halfbaked example bug mora forced replay entire boss fight point rushed couldnt bothered trying dodge damage ended getting nodamage achievement even though take damage game also completely unplayable dualshock controls mapped incorrectlyprofessional reviewers got copy game early typically excused ignored bugs review due assumption bugs review copies would fixed release casethe next issue game stems contextually fact sequel review oribf took issue fact game left useful ability dash players hands end gamewhile game variety useful abilities bash dash early good thing game still feels like section typically focuses use ability unlocked section really hinders games ability challenge players provide great platforming experience whilst abilities sections used others typically extensive use within platforming time latergame abilities burrowing used outside windswept wastes get shards otherwise locked game improves first providing useful movement abilities towards start however platforming never engaging would guess design choice developers might made cater casual audience platforming engaged final section requires ori maintain airborne really long time pushes player said high point platforming mildly challenging lasting minutes really highlights lackluster rest game regard platforming tight generally means nothing levels allow sloppiest execution platforming abilityon combat generally better first game however dodging whilst using standard slash pressing one button thats summed even case bosses sure additional combat abilities cost energy none efficient even useful circumstances tried using different abilities ended sticking standard slash something use combat healing ability entire game flying enemies pretty annoying enemy projectile deal bashing projectile straight back themon bosses game underwhelming mora shriek fights ones stand mora interesting phases require respond differently shriek step shrieks fight insanely good actually challenging died multiple times variety well choreographed attacks makes utilise movement abilities whilst forcing player try land hits attacks also interesting bullet hell segment though like platforming one boss coming right end obviously thought actually good despite short makes bosses including mora feel underwhelming even mora best boss game imoon sand worm really good escape sequence pushed player well utilise burrowing ability optimal manner ensuring player uses right angle diethe kwollok fight seconds without putting thought fight howl corruption whatever boss causes escape seen water mill incredibly one dimensional unchallenging useless bosses serve little purpose within wider story story good however good sea mediocrityby far one enjoyable aspects game side quests involving helping moki made every section complete feel alive progress platforming finding gorlek ore used bring community moki together central hub really engaging despite simple something found really heartwarming enjoyable story around shriek ku ok became emotionally attached fast would captivated progress story however bosses howlsand worm dont fit anywhere within wider story merely provide unmeaningful speedbump oris quest regard corruption understand fits story revolving around improving life moki letting water run clear corruption within minute player seen kwollok corrupt kwollok makes little sense story provide boring combat boss beaten seconds also provides one least meaningful fights within story devs decided raise emotional stakes suddenly without explanation corrupting kwolloki personally disliked bittersweet ending involving ori think shame throw away character become invested personal gripe objectively ending good makes sense foreshadowed also respect objectively think leaving story available continue another protagonist ending way oribf started good also dislike shriek ended rejecting warmth sought light yet final cutscene shriek believe intended make viewer pity feel sorry shriek involved seeking warmth implied dead parents makes little sense thought like lot storyoverall worth liked first gamemetroidvanias ori wisps opinion great game enjoyed challenge offered meand although game buggy release patch recently released seems fixed issues havingnow feel like enjoy game even already dothe thing like physics moving around ori feels wonderfull dash string moves together start feel like true master game absolutely awesome point things dont like id hard

mapstone systems gone replaced ones clearly inspired titles hollow knight slotted upgrades found hidden throughout map obtain upgrades maps cast side characters etc game quite bit dialogue compared first one though much silent experiencethe game also features sidequests obtained cast side characters spread fairly well around map thankfully utilize optional areas meaning reason go unlike ori blind forest pretty gave backstory naru otherwise inconsequentialthe progression game opened quite bit unlike first game would progress areas predetermined order obtain first wisp game opens allows venture every single area order would like exception games finale chamber desert wisp found within enhance replayability game considerably every single area game designed beatable primary mobility tool introduced within though still contain secrets must obtained tools areas resulting situations certain skills practically useless outside area found flash noteworthy examplefinally notably game features proper combat system large number skills choose number also double mobility tools number skills obtained way previous game majority combat skills purchased specific side character predetermined order allowing use whatever skills would like whatever point game find complement vastly superior combat system game features boss fights addition chase sequences ori blind forestfor enjoy chase sequences ori blind forest care boss fights whatsoever implemented pause option skip challenges however know using option skips entire encounter segment boss fights contain chase sequences interlaced within use peril similar first one even better longer play deeper story charming music everything recomend simply one finest platformers one best modern studios cant recommend otwow enough

practically perfect every way scores excellent good good bad bad awful performance excellent art style excellent gameplay excellent story good sound music voice excellentthis masterpiece ori blind forest excellent game much improved specially playgame second game ive ever platinumed first ask ori blind foreststill game cute noises ori dashing gasping air seriousness game blows first ori completely water absolutely must get second part one greatest platformers ever disappoint new monsters new abilities new weapons much seems like oris inspired hollow knight seems like nice little game brief time played showed beautiful world music score however clearly made played game controller mousekeyboard could way clunky play controls seems quite like previous opus though bit dense quests challenges sequel ori basically hollow knight gameplay oris worldif like hollow knight well gotta love game sequel ori blind forest game continued use graphics style uses mostly gameplay new abilities ori use new customization system devs added challenges either directly provide upgrades give ingame money making upgrades im sure great idea safely ignore platforming challenges though bosses big angry figure lazy went guide third part somewhat dislike chase scenes little room errors isnt path pain hollow knight still painful speech ingame voiced gibberish actual meaning provided subtitles dont bother localized voicing sequel lives hype game play smooth controls well personally love upgraded combat system makes true metroidvania understand first game series didnt quite qualify challenging frustrating also story make sob sequels better original quite rare better originalbut said luma pools stupid frustrating sand chase know im talking played serious master piece first game hooked constantly thinking stunning looked smooth movements could possibly improve nailed every bit id recommend game anyone grab thank later seriously awesome game cannot imagine amount work truly went constructing amazing platformer everything sweet music indicating emotions feel ambience various ingame areas truly pulls game together near masterpiece edge getting game would highly recommend taking plunge dont regret dont let cute aesthetic fool game challenge challenge isnt bad thing since made investing play seriously love game havent play ori series man ure wasting ur entire gaming life best aspect game one much better one ofc one go buy play trust worth seriously best series games ever played think xbox pc versions ori blind forest must played game times one completed within two days purchase simply could put game platformer style coupled beautiful art amazing musical scores combat puzzles done right ive never much fun playing game series entire years life hope badly moon studios continues create games moon studiosthank amazing work game last plan launching another game pay send link launch page please love dear make another one bravo every one worked seriously piece art even better first one perfect one beautiful games ever played movement combat feels smooth fluid collectibles really fun look map big story really emotional intriguing hoped could get little bit lore world amazing bad find little bit short want keep playing games short simple improved version great view nailed first game chapter extra goodnessthere definitely advances areas combat variety platforming level design great length difficulty good onissues ask really things noe able reach many collectables well intended unlock point game via triple jump tight platforming gamebreaking leastto nitpick combat abilities pretty nicheunused find stuck worked swapping couple moves finding hard find scenarios abilities worth effortother couple glitches start appearing extended play time example grappling time would slow sometimes ori would accelerate screen insane speedsor warping screen would fade second time quite late already begun platforming sometimes returning new starting position extended sessions reopening game resolved issuestldr enjoyed first one youll enjoy one amount short sweet enjoy first game must play ori wisps emotional journey didnt expect make shed tear short answer yes totally freaking recommend game totally worth money even morethis game totally flied radar idea making even planned ive ori blind forest wishlist years last year dear friend gifted started playing instantly something happened never happened cried beginning cutscene remember crying game ever prior thatobviously steam recommended game releasing soon since played previous game get game loving owls huge course buy recently beat ori blind forest jumped straight one released wednesday since first launched game story happenings game dwelling mind nonstop story writers definitely knew make touching story stays mind even stop playingthe beginning starts happy got crying eyes happiness thinking happier game blind forest dont let happy beginning fool happenings game really heartrending cannot count many times cried cause game big points story makerslovely visual style found gazing scenery multiple times throughout gamereally emotional game huge rollercoaster emotionsi would recommend game times could best money spent everthank reading rant review hopefully got consider buying game cause definitely recommend bottom broken heartthank also developers making lovely game love work short sweet short summary review bveryb good game one mechanically solid praiseworthy platforming games played awhile much theres little critique mechanically nothing worth docking review score story entirely shows made comparison first game also anything point say terrible cant say part would critique means tell ori wisps fantastic game regardless spite flaws spoilers discussion details dont need read summarize full opinion bi recommend bmost points short format since critiques part minor need go detail give nothing praise platforming mechanically years since played ori blind forest frustrations platforming present really mean none slightest critique would anything platforming forgiving way easily bypass intended design complete platforming section first game missing platforming areas could mean falling spikes wait take damage ticks die return checkpoint platforming demanding required designed approach take game easy land spikes hop taking slight damage often could first game making things right way unnecessary freedom good comes expense challenge method reaching goal doesnt challenge also makes game drift away metroidvania lockandkey design typical genre loosened much linear times solved puzzle harder way missing tool right way hard notice otherwise platforming good game didnt feel like wrong noticed got power later even thats praiseworthythe game includes fair amount equippable powers modifiers feel like less approach would worked better many combat powers went unused werent necessary many shard modifiers arent worth equipping different power like unequipping platforming power combat one bossfight flow breaking tedious improvement combat wish many players first game given lot excess stuff isnt needed fewer permanent upgrades would made refinedbosses also bit weird game putting side side escape sequences bosses escapes make use platforming abilities youve practiced point show mastered sufficiently tense exciting bosses dont follow dont design approach normal monsters dont teach fight games bosses like games especially example like sekiro shadows die twice ori combat isnt difficult enough need learn anything normal monsters learn doesnt teach anything bosses made bosses feel arbitrary combo bossescape sequences felt lot better bosses alonelastly elements game design felt like tickbox inclusions done well say felt someone went wishlist players first game wanted added sequel better combat skills customization quests forest creatures forest den could build improve even zones like watermill zone forest zone sand zone winter zone water zone theyre gorgeous course first game hollow spiky sky mountain giant forest tree wellspring pure water ice fire forge mountain along side typical forest cave environments well done feel tickboxed main critique comes something feel summary story makes sense execution premise didnt make across design ori ku venture trying teach ku fly get caught storm land island suffering similar fate first game ku injured ori must rejuvinate spirit tree save ku time must realize destiny become spirit tree save land creeping forces decay save friend okay suppose comes across flat actual game lot little details contribute jumping novice ku getting caught storm save entire land feels arbitrary theres context powers gain like first game kind story behind npcs telling player ori save doesnt feel like proper buildup feels like best secret everyone knows since realizing destiny doesnt happen culmination story less get info dumped end game wall murals seir saying similarly bosses lack context bosses monster possesses local sage frog beat vanishes get sprite sand zone sandworm appears arbitrarily run done smidge context aggression given also note ori doesnt show much expression many game scenes think facial expressiveness body language could gone long way make feel like place story made sense hes incredibly stoic offputting adds feeling cant connect story time around sense story kind happens around ori instead involving first game players could connect ori desperate loneliness separation family almost universal sympathy ianyonei could attach worked pretty well story game doesnt feel relatable lacks punch heard moon studios planned ending original game context makes total sense games ending would fit first game perfectly makes juxtaposition jarring things say notably musical score lacks punch frequently pulls motifs popular track first game unsurprisingly tracks catchy would nice callback first game less ubiquitous tracks standout entire soundtrack quite excellent either way gareth coker wonderful job ask two ori games id recommend would say first one story issues sense concise design mentioned subtle significant thats fine good though excellent games well worth full recommendation ran bugs issues game plays excellently steam controller short hours get games goodies unlockables touching beautiful good game even though dust somehow ends eyes play short worth every pennylong worth every moment play time beautiful graphic phenomenal soundtracksthe game challenging level makes interesting entire play nominated best art style soundtrack gameplay story steam awards renamed ori bucket tears better first game first game masterpieceart game year whatever guess hades gets award stand hades still good sick

graphically way better first harder move along get much health times feels overpowering bosses health needed bosses good addition last one charts good challenging ive read people complaining one particular escape sequence hard remember tree escape sequence first one way challenging rage inducing music amazing like first movement tougher beginning end leaping around levels sorts abilities like

quest etc like first ori game absolutely love game mechanics skills story line side questsunlike first ori version lot different ways customize ori help progress adventures ability choose different active skills well passive bonuses make game feel like control play style however really far truth unfortunately tons shards available slots available use given time normally would swap based situation shards even worth using slots filled mandatory shards like magnet sticky catalyst overflow reckless spirit surge resilience lifeforce either key mechanic features raw damage buffs able kill enemies throughout game last slot one available diversity buildsfurthermore weapon skills either mandatory novelty weapon attacks like spirit smash required crushing walls floors enemies shields various types launch light burst regenerate also key skills using entire game however skills spirit edge exact thing spirit smash free cost use quickly replaced required mechanics latter skills like sentry spike spirit star blaze cost far much resources actually use limited resource pool almost done game personally never found use throughout full play thought ninja stars spears light seem cool mechanics clunky dont provide anything cant get light burst anyways sentry plain bad sentry basically doesnt damage requires cast whole gang one enemy leave energyfinally think going try spirit arc bow build dont bother use mandatory spirit shards even make function right give key shards try novelty buildover enjoyed game opinion rather short points required quick google search clue spots almost impossible figure without lots dumb luck talking musical flower puzzles hopefully time content developers make balance changes add additional content time start feel like mastery game decent build

specific options handle terribly burrow swim dashing grapple etc game mightve bit fun framerate issues actually fixed stands cant recommend game importantly end game get power trivializes previous platforming sections rendering point platformer moot obnoxiously stupid sections downright easy others game good game good game good first one better let tell whyit unique style vibe mechanics one feels like im playing softcore hollow knight great mechanics opening map getting experience first game speak cartographer hello hollow knight adding spirit shards charms hollow knight generally making currency spirit light trading npcs first one pure experience could interpreted character power growthi still think game looks sounds amazing small things disappointed developers created original concept feel first game instead developing threw everything bin took hollow knight concept insteadand makes frustrated game gorgeous gameplay top notch music sends chills spine story pulls heartstrings like unbelievable could top previous installment leave wanting ori game great every single aspect youre even remotely interested platforming game everything music atmosphere mechanics combat everything going find bugs first playthrough second never experienced anything odd might patched although wasnt anything gamebreaking oh great decided play second time directly first

gives many things many weapons many options challenges take oris move set similar oatbf slight changes oatwotw definitely worth dollars recommend one really enjoyed first wants play fun game game great masterpiece eyes replaying art style soundtrack well continues draw great story fun gameplay think great improvement first already great one favorite games far one best ive played game great love everything runs fine pc issues game great really good enough computer run enjoy metroidvanias cant recommend enough people might disagree feel game near perfect execution aside bugs ive heard compared okami despite different genre style agree statement first game series focuses story exploration wisps combatfocus skimping aforementioned id suggest playing prequel first since im opinion one better pretty good game finishing game first time might take hours depending play id say among games would come back play every years case mentioned bugs moment though game much enjoyable despite game great combat great metroidvanias like hollow knight little clunky repetitive however movement incredible moving around world enjoyable start chaining together right skills maybe even better movement mario odyssey world exploration also nice creative super detailed visuals audio wrapped together world beautifulalso theres lame glitches like able pull levers changed personalized controls without switching back default pull switch back custom every switch even need switches theres like game completely irrelevant overall dont break overall enjoyable game hands one best games ive ever played immersive storyline beautiful graphics incredible soundtrack challenging gameplay considering picking hits every single category play game hands best library emotional beautifully designed cant give enough game honestly masterpieceit pretty much takes first one makes better lot aspects never review games love one much review itthe visual design music youd expect ori mindblowingly good one biggest reasons game charming immersive times wanted stop take scenery listen beautiful soundtrackthe platforming level design also really good level brings something new gimmicks abilities required overcome obstacles said level speaking abilities fun feel smooth polished however highly recommend change keybindings since abilities overlap times youll accidently use ability didnt want could possibly lead deaththe story means anything complex perfect example simple yet effective cute adventure surface tells tale loss love sacrificeand last least combat favorite part unique really separates game last one ill start mentioning weapon wheel weapons equipped time first might seem restricting actually really nice piece design since swap weapons middle battle depending need enough weapons game suit multiple playstyles experiment different synergies one minus however shards lot feel somewhat unimpactful boring mostly giving damage damage resistance cells etc though polished smooth combat also previous pros didnt care shards muchthe one single major con game fps drops sound stutters break immersion time time really wish immerse id suggest waiting patchesall loved game hands one best games

reason likely never play game good ever encourage play ori games awed originality beautiful medium oris story told save coronavirus scratch silksong itch time pretty apart presentation complete trash comparison blind forestadding actual boss fights game controls specifically designed fastpaced flowing platforming incomprehensible decision take hollow knight example game gives player absolute control character thats whats needed combating difficult bosses ori gives player fantastic flow multitude options traversing terrain matter many combat tools add game wont make combat good first game monsters pretty much filler extending game time combat wasnt deep engaging enemies sparse enough easily dispatchable enough wasnt issue didnt detract core gameplay awesome platforming challengeson hard difficulty wisps thousand weapons disposal exactly deal substantial damage short misguided effort marry platforming combat core movement mechanics permit one done welli know english shit also

cry rivers hours end would cry enjoyed part enjoy part though admittedly enjoyed first ori one still lot fun well worth moneyi times game started get buggy fully exiting application start menu seemed fix problems whenever happened though would recommend game sale loved everything original disappointing sequel major problems previous game pros game pretty controlling ori fantastic interesting platforming level design allowed sequence breaking good improved moveset ori terms platforming cons combat sections suffer much visual noise often always feels like main challenge melee combat figuring enemy boss fights usually better always combat much less satisfying platforming general makes combat even frustrating cannot creative combat platforming designers probably looked combat ori thought good improve fine way improved giving ori moves making enemies interesting fight platforming level design fleshed original game level design still good never really felt like ramped degree original sections require use oris full moveset many unskippable cutscenes amount control wrestled away player game staggering though proper cutscenes skippable game recognize much time control taken away cutscene time wisp something say npc animation get dialogue ori happens upon story beat game halts stop one thing alone absolutely killed motivation go back replay game story nothing special think game beautiful soundtrack epic designers thought story really moving impactful simple played makes amount time terms cutscenes baffling game longer hours experienced less great platforming original took hours long set piece style platforming bits never original felt cues werent good enough reliably complete first try nothing changes one section expected hide behind tattered cloth hiding behind foliage work often challenge answering question sequence developer want platform area conclusionthis still ori game platforming still nearly unmatched platformers original platforming section level design good flaws felt minor however wisps significant problems game feel platforming level design barely makes playing game worth though story problems game fun play beautifully crafted visually audibly though last game series im interested studio next though changes game play actually better previous gamestill great story telling make wanna get bottom matter hard game changes game

start end including side quests collectibles cannot recommend enough absolute gem platformer definitely revisiting future didnt enjoy one quite much original still incredible game quite worth money due current issues sound occasionally working sale would heavily recommend buying havent played much yet immediately see changes theyve made last game already loved ori blind forest already tell one superior likely inspiration hollow knight another game absolutely adore im thankful new featureswhats combat much enjoyable moved targeting light orbs light blade swing directions similar hollow knight far tell probably many skills havent discovered skills collected much like hollow knight amulets forgot names select equipped collection allows go play style instead following limited options skill tree like ori blind quests form npcs currency last game dont skill tree instead purchase itemsskills npcs giving lot freedom choiceit perfect singleplayer platformer relax also gives satisfaction beating monsters whatever style prefer allows fly map incredible speeds due convenient overpowered skills collect early game much like first game difficult opinion still fulfilling honest cant say much considering ive played like hour definitely worth money think combined best parts ori blind forest beautiful maps soundtracks skills hollow knight combat skill system quests im way ori wisps already shaping great game offers exploration puzzle solving tight controls previous installment adding several new mechanicsbuttons assigned certain capabilities much like links awakenings gameboy world feels populated npcs littering landscape giving hints side quests driving story alongin particular new rpg style equiping shards managing given scenario interestinglooking forward finishing one recommend game think almost masterpiecemoon studios really needs hire good talented writersalmost everything game top tierbut cant help feel game really needed lorebetter dialogues well written side questsi really bothered consistently bad writing mainly perfectly well designed everything else isthe final nail coffin dog shit endinganother minor problem would weapon design generic uninspiredthe combat improvement blind forest hoping something creative comes weapon design sadly let lot like first game made huge improvements combat alone good enough recommend game liked first one doesnt hold story wise predecessor still superb metroidvania surely replay year two enjoyed every hour money well spen may little bugs glitches like getting stuck wall screen going black happened restart fixed performance hiccups fps sometimes goes like slow motion effect mostly system aint used kinda old masterpiece game art style visual fidelity sound sound editing music gorgeous played game headphones spent least half hour listening menu music combat better ever fluid awesome game isnt forgiving comes difficulty side even normal game pretty challenging sometimes especially slow pc sometimes also platforming ask bit usual player like handholding something fond games start finishall pleasant experience despite negatives recommend anyone looking platformer tight controls touching narrative kinda feel love care went game notice details world quality still annoying moments like first game good way like cuphead game expanded first game every way told richer story better encounters levels abilities obvious comes combat mechanics game heavilly inspired one certain representative genre ori wisps still maintans focus one main attractions first game movement chase sequences endgame abilities blind forest available almost immediately betternew shards system different combat spells allow variation abilities much better choices making wrong choice could make one boss fights much harder becomapred predecessor game linear side quests nice little bonus expect much story behind plenty collectables serve purpose completing everything hard difficulty took hoursoverall improvement first game enjoyed thoroughly despite technical issues like rare audio stutters felt story lacked cohesion towards end little bit repetitive still art direction soundtrack flow game make must play metroidvania fan playing prepare box tissues side either blown away blown away absolute masterpiece game game good done even better definitely would like recommend game everyone game frame rate dips sound errors time time least got opening day experience still worth fun gameplay emotion story fantastic soundtrack good first game must play fan metroidvania games game beats first one things isnt perfect yes graphics improvedthe side quests new additions mechanics truly amazing stunning rpg feel game comes cost character development diffrent take ori universe gameplay additions less relationship building made first game heads right direction falls short towards end story still recommend beautiful game dont expect offer emotional depth first one game feels little derivative resemblance hollow knight lot right combat feels decent though large health pool floaty imprecise movement means particularly complex challenging ability options nice though didnt usually find using two three story much like first game incredible takes darker less hopeful tone ending game really happy ending ori many people youll meet along way long story short id recommend game anyone enjoyed first game anyone else likes metroidvania style games hurt game devs battletoads speeder bike level game great got runordie events whoever thinks dark souls hard never played thisbut liked visuals wholeheartedly enjoyed playing start finish pacing fantastic bit confusing time overall welcome experience wholesome game great gameplay beautiful graphics took already great

ive ever played game piece art considering buying game highly recommend platforming superb combat quite enjoyable one two fps drops crashes still good platformer alot fun one best games ive ever played heart breakingly good played tad bit game far feel look first game positive thing opinion would recomend liked first game ori babynow better combat ori blind forest sequel favorite game time everything beautiful soundtrack gameplay story unique experience game truly masterpiece ori wisp brings back good platforming feeling together pretty awesome music charracters storyonly bad part classic instant death things else pretty solid game ori wisps beautiful work art music fits area aside times encountered bug made hanging objects go crazy expected bugs made laugh fixed saving relaunching game give ori wisps continuation first game time around game much open ended many side quests secrets find helps game much playtime ori didnt much main quest replay value low visuals greatly improved animations crisp game runs smooth settingsgameplay gameplay little different ori wide range skills quite helpful defeating bosses ori put multiple bosses time last time boss battles soundtrack quality sound track still pretty good main theme first game starts playing felt nostalgic much issues games due map massive time sometimes finding objective quite hard maybe thats worth ori wisps almost masterpiece almost could go game fluid gameplay ability set greatly increases oris maneuverability beautifully crafted areas animation yet slight lack polish encountered throughout time game really stops placing definitive label inability finish quests without mashing e key musical cues lost replayed cutscene audio visual stuttering forcing change gpu settings dont get wrong still amazing game obvious amount love care put game well worth price tag yet times encountered bugginess firmly pulled games ethereal experience particularly realized bugs experienced players since release five months ago game exceptional caliber otherwise disheartening seemed released ready bedespite complaints would wholeheartedly recommend game truly well deserved sequel ori blind forest effortlessly surpassing quality every area especially compared aspects game found almost flawless bugs easily fixed near future seen multitude patched initially wrote review july perhaps bugs experienced fixed leave thoughts however game best played blind cant help rest review might bit spoilery sorry rest review bit long ive divided several parts feel free skim read certain sections likeill start first story one reasons enjoyed blind forest much complaint lies contrived starting felt upon kus first flight ku ori choose follow flock birds way past limits nibel across sea foreign land seemed completely hand would ori careless travel far get trapped storm tumble dark forests niwen soon naru gumo looking see flock birds unearthly reason decide ku ori must followed seemed ridiculous part ku serves central role story seems especially contrived relationship ori solely developed cutscenes prologue couple minutes gameplay game revolving around made seem like plot device anything else much better exposition would ori ku learning fly perhaps one day see niwen dark foreboding distance perhaps come back regroup talk naru gumo decide investigate reach foreign land realize decay like nibel like good samaritans take upon restore ori ku looking silent forest encounter shriek tragic event takes place would much emotional weight particularly naru gumo witness save minor gripe ori wisps still brings home masterclass story hope loss mercy redemption bringing player understanding however pitiful main antagonists origins like blind forest delivered ending completely shattered tears moon studios really knows develop end storyill also quickly touch music graphics gareth cokers soundtrack blind forest never gets old brings life boss fight area enemy also serves heartbreaking touch games final moments graphics anyone see went beyond amount love care precise little details area background cutscenes honestly puts blind forest shamea refreshing change compared blind forest revitalization combat blind forest combat secondhand focus platforming evident major challenges game escape sequences simplistic attack sein heavy grunt work attacking made sense wisps two much shorter escape sequences six grueling boss fights new focus combat reflected new wide variety attack choices pros cons unlocked easily switch using attack point game focus also displayed story compared gumo kuro blind forest bosses encounter game often unwavering final breath idea putting six feet yet bosses would classify forgettable simply offered little challenge practically nothing story include first boss wolflike creature named howl encounter first couple minutes introduction niwen defend closerange torch darting quick succession blows reaches half health boss fights ends turns runs screeching forest first doesnt seem strange rather seems teasing second boss fight rematch better abilities weapons except well never happens find petrified corpse silent forest later game missed scene turned stone second boss hornbug glorified version rhino beetle whose main attack consists charging quickly simply outmaneuvered gain access unprotected rear last forgettable bosses willow stone fifth boss youll encounter ball energy covered stones knock away attack admit successive playthroughs completely forgot boss located penultimate area otherwise consists solely platforming challenges seems well place three bosses spoilermora corrupted kwolok shriekspoiler actually deserve title boss offers challenge really tested platforming skills maneuverability choice attacks especially hard mode learn bosss set attacks cues well pairing appropriate method attack would loved boss fights included challenging aspect game ever satisfying masterfinally weve reached heart game oris ability set somehow moon studios able surpass blind forest adding grappling ability burrowing sand swim dashing damaging projectile also bash launch ori propel themself direction adding whole new dimension maneuverability complaint abilities full extent communicated player particularly sand burrowing ability idea able burrow hanging bags sand sand platformswrapping long review despite critiques
