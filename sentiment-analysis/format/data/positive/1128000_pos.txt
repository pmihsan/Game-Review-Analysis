good idea trying different instead sticking leveling progression fighting difficult gathering gear exploring slow good play game difficulty still think sort progression outside gear essential keeping people engaged overall goal maybe really neat map another region lot crafting supplies idk artifacts help get good amount plus crafting books gathering resources playing game always useful starting new zone think easy times would maybe like every mob turn yellow difficulty getting max stars weapons gear zone ability murder npcs game fresh canvas many possibilities future updates get lot different things maybe use invest realm enjoy made dude enjoys plus every person got game free past purchase didnt recommend upset want rape level come back alpha rape sheep dogs wollays wife wollay aint cuck aint gonna let incel gearhaters rape wife bought game years ago alpha one fun games ive played beta version game almost different due reworking core systems see developers tried introduce brand new play style game new play style causes game feel limited people fine playing first hours maybe completing zone filled quests game progress basically set unless find specific gear used adjacent zones finding specific gear definitely provide motivation play little bit longer motivation wears quickly zone zone youre forced reset almost entirelythe previous skill tree exp system removed entirely rare artifacts provide permanent stat changes character however minimal almost unnoticeable change form movement speeds matter long play character improved form letting travel little bit fasteri somewhat enjoyed game first hours immediately lost almost interest grind grind find least piece specific gear gaining nothing meantime little bits gold moving next zone would make previous game play feel uselessthe entertainment game short lived rewarding long game play feels extremely limited recommend game current state love game playing nonstop since first got think people insulting game either havent played havent played minutes parroting peoples opinions otherwise disappointed game different alpha havent given fair chance personally didnt like alpha much fun nothing got boring quickly comparatively newer version game chalk full things exploring super fun additionally like region locked items heres adds fun exploring new regions provides new tasks region walk new region knowing exactly need find artifacts key items get better gear tasks take time make feel like accomplished something provide incentive fully exploring new areas items werent region locked new areas game would easy exploring wouldnt fun especially true account nature game point game provide infinite adventure places explore legion locking items makes invested exploring new regions experiencing unique area offer additionally fact game goes forever means didnt lock items would get become powerful game goes pick artifacts provide permanent boosts game would lose challenge region locking items makes sure always challenge even played long time conclusion really love game fun well worth twenty bucks especially see map content getting dont listen negative reviews basically meme culture worst always problem cube world honestly even game something everyone would love matter people would still flooded reviews negative comments since hating cube world popular meme since give game try see like game really fun get used new progression system overall game added bunch new semi unique dungeons really fun friends cube world good game sort technically well built game yes well designed game tried play iteration game couldnt get first run utterly frustrating could find starting town bad rng think undead mage everything wanted kill kill quickly everything tried elf rogue little luck butnot much world overbearing death trap stillin fact without basic equipment upgrades impossible much time start stated first minutes players time game filled certain death im saying games hold hand able accomplish anything great designi suppose sort progression game didnt seem fun failed hook world felt see drudgery getting point point progression clear funi play hours hours alpha back day remember able quite bit new player challenging get going never bogged artificial progression hoops wanted take big ogre get goyoud probably diebut possible couldnt even kill chicken entered world new edition game without feeling threatened one chicken area forget itit instant deathi feel game great technical achievment small team great potential attractive open world even minimalistic voxels attractive endearing game spades game play simply fails basic leveli cannot recommend game though want want try someday dont currently patience deal whatever wollay wants players awesome game tons potential game beforehand came alpha loved playing hoursnow must say things changed alpha dont necessarily agree lack exp leveling system im hoping arent permenantly removing since really made whole class system almost completely customizable could ores placed awesomely huge cave systems well considering need ores make equipment melee class hand new things beta implement pretty awesome adds lot game quest systems fast travel new areas unlocked reworking towns new mobs rework overhauls new existing dungeons id say game alot hits taken im sure since creators put steam im sure get updates improve pre existing features well adding amazing new features game gets unlimited potential cant say much changed since cube world first came years ago yes new content surprising little repetitive real levelling system game least traditional rpg style game like used rather underwhelming equipment mechanic doesnt live hoping game edit abandoned gameafter hours original alpha safe say really love cubeworld ive played hours cubeworld since beta release longer game beforeand okay fact love version cubeworld whole lot beforepeople talk ill regionlock system first confused ingenius system makes game region exciting new really hope see wollay pixxie continuing work release future updates great potential character progressions feels nonexistent artifacts gave decent combat stats would fine dont know haters talking game engaging fun emergent amazing coop rpg takes little time buff beginning payoff wonderful really wanted like game simply cant hardly chance survive long enough get better gear explore world every corner waits overpowered monster kills effort playing game like playing soulslike underleveled sure go one bonefire another shrines get fight choice run want progress game beyond spawn im sure laptops specs whatever game runs smooth smooth time show characters moving smoothly hit continue game wont show backgrounds shows blue screen buttons map visible way fix fixed next patch fun goof multiplayer game lacks depth still lot bugsim updating review abundantly clear without shadow doubt developer doesnt give prefers simple pump dump thank goodbye transaction short dont buy let game fade obscurity like author game great grinding system resets one region another lack variety skills little bit frustratingi know game took lot effort made hope next update one put new mechanics features would improve game lot make enjoyable game still fun play region locked gear wasnt thing would challenge outside first couple hours boats reins etc shouldnt locked good game ive really enjoying game playing solo friends see ppl complaining really bad played alpha years friends enjoyed alpha stopped got bit sad moved month ago found getting beta release hyped maybe slightly remember alpha like remember xp skill tress gliders etc looked beta cube world fresh faceso roll last monday surprised yes nothing like old game learning curve bet ya like lot games hold hand game went controls go son fun play mostly friends really enjoy playing different classes expororing finish region kill bosses hits move feel like new game againsure features want wollay add like artifacts giving permeant stat boosts actual combat stats pets useful gliderboatrains bound get better find community give wollay constructive feedback instead acting like children maybe listen lets honest developing game adult starts acting like entilited prick moaning whinning wanted game sending much hate way would listen would nottldr enjoy game dont fine dont act like speak humanity say game fun adult act like one spoilt brat get way sure dont enjoy game fair enough sorry feel way everyone else toxic crying need get grip game brought years ago played game back first released alpha wasnt perfect game fun everything want say already said many others putting help keep people buying sad really love gamejust read reviews ill recommend game wollay make changes hours playing trying enjoy playing without successi dont know made wollay change game much right end im hopeful get better better release comparing alpha really miss features little thingsi miss talent tree even though wasnt big made big difference wollay removed miss exp systemi miss old villages made much sense comparing beta current one looks like bunch random buildings put wrong locationsi miss old inventory let organize items new one downgrade imoi dont even want talk region lock system bad implemented making hate actual progressionartifacts actually joke supposed main feature game everyone hates change dont even care changing make artifacts actually useful making maybe increase stamina regen maybe increasing resistance stun would game changing progression supposed complete regions thinking artifacts uselesslet talk things saw improved addedthe classes still need tweaks improved comparing alphathe villages alive compared alpha npcs running made game look alivelore happy saw wollay added something lore every region hope improves imagine hear read lot game tyrant king terrified people get hint buried cathedral desert another region go see became undead commanding undead army kill get weapon previously quoted note played lot original alpha years ago really enjoyed didnt play recent prerelease alpha update played hours steam beta ton fun game switching back forth warrior character ranger character archer really love exploration aspects game think critical part whether someone enjoy game read anything game around launch know progression system controversial permanent progression character tiny conveniences collecting artifacts slightly faster gliding speed gear becomes useless travel different regions mapfor fun exploring every nook cranny region making sure find every single artifact hopefully find one two gear items move onto next region little bit power boost experience always enough gear going new region feel strong enough jump fights midlevel enemies enjoy process gearing new region said start best part game giant procedurally generated world collectiblesif dont like idea game collect items sake getting might hold attention long bonuses really miniscule really tied idea constantly driving make character stronger stronger probably frustrating gear system cube world definitely unusual doesnt really change minutetominute gameplay rpgs always enemies around weaker ones stronger none gets way see real goal game exploration old review good game kinda boring harder grind early game nothing like used frankly boring much build thrown aside something new didnt make better im still going leave positive review honor game instead become tldrif youre casual player game might youif like looking rewarding time sink could put tens hundreds hours still feel like something work towards isnt world potential current state really fun hoursplaying friends definitely increases enjoyment game tenfoldcompared alpha missing large amount satisfying progressioni personally categorised cube world grind fest game alpha enemies scaling level areas varying difficulty enjoyable play hours upon hours reach goal set whether certain level boss kill fun grind towardsthe issue come current cube world kind end game pinpoint set eyes work towardsgear region locked exception gear makes region either incredibly repetitive absolute snooze festfor examplei started game water mage generally support player enjoy helping friends play gamesso rogueninja friend ran region spawned fun timealthough towards end region happened across wandwhat ensued friend following around next areas went basically nothing could also get piece gear seeing gear became null area whilst still able kill named mobs easeeven though gotten lucky get piece gear made game less enjoyable multiplayer scenarioadditionally added bonus completing region artifacts underwhelming say least almost everybody pointed artifacts rewarding enough make going new region losing almost gear feel awfulit feels every region new game game mode without impactful bonusescube world still lot charm feels watered compared ye old daysbut alas look forward seeing cube world goes hope heart people coding knowledge come cube world begin modding believe game could really flourish modding community alpha backer honestly dont think wollay knows hes solo dev hope starts involving community fixes mess even probably wont come back biggest downgrade game ive ever seen feels like huge slap face money spent time waited open betadate ive played alpha activated old account steampros looks beautiful like always hasgameplay quick get used toovery smooth old rigmost likely hit updates might quick molding consconsno leveling like used leading feel like grind never really gets easier weighs systems used fun gear almost pointless crafting less useful betting good drop monsters youll unlikely beat real way getting strongergear drops class locked mage gets lucky something drop might even useableno starting area anymore big deal definitely isnt helped pitfallsexploring great points major hassle headache go places get stronger plus gear region locked part gear symbol keep strengthdungeons blast get lucky good gear lead high lvl greens first otherwise suffers problems exploringin id say first played game awesome love cant wait alpha back major chance change improvement theres setbacks importantly made great strides better hope wollay best luck cant recommend game current state happy change recommendation game gets updates deserves feel like game could gotten better wollay co decided open criticism versus staying games like starsector received well due devs listening community even putting mods fans made base game alpha great give looks ive played went path away alpha neither alpha final release game perfect earlier version strong foundation could kind see wollay wanted game go lot players excited see would turn years additional workwollay got good game good playerbase please dont let go waste ignore positive reviews posted beta launched seen current state game effectively reviews alpha different game would recommend game current state since alpha version years ago developer removed majority rpg elements game well adding region locking system equipmenttools pretty much start start game every time change regionon top recent beta people bought game years

youre soloriginal reviewcube world finally releasing today long years week betawhile alpha betafull version releases fundamentally different core fighting mobs finding loot exploring huge map remains im fan new region lock system hours playing youll get used itfor whove never played cube world starting die lot choose opponents carefully likely cheese get better weapons things even white tier kill hits game doesnt hold hand find questobjectives youll either talk npcs randomly find location looking map may daunting first know youre looking helps planning adventures better highly recommend starting mage op class get hang core mechanicsin honesty game still needs lot work optimization technical issues beta really shouldve longer fix know wollay wife working game issues may take time fix im sure wollays stance mods full release alpha version huge mod scene im hoping theyll return add new flavors steam workshop items base game since fighting mobs get really repetitiveoverall issues major changes alpha enjoyed beta hours playing beta solo explored regions fully completed regions surprisingly never found glider though found artifacts region worked way getting gold tier weapon armorsmost negative reviews changes game mainly progress system agree bunch points said earlier youll get used new system future updates hope wollay maybe ease find balance alpha beta least gearweapons wont completely utterly useless crossing new border youve never played alpha wouldnt worry much know difficult starting get repetitiveso youre looking game get hour two day give cube world shot hours game time dont hate game bought alpha years ago absolutely loved itthe beta good think thing help game returning back old leveling systemdont necessarily take progression system take region locked gear make area certain level example one think negatives game lack leveling system region locked gear also quest markers npcs offer quests finding dungeons artifacts insanely hard scrolling map ive done find ive found farand almost hours gameplay havent found npc offers dungeon quests still level im loving iti liked alpha like wellwould like footstep sound lowered though hours clean one zone climbing speed amazing alpha high gypsy trashy mofckin piece utter hellish crap expectationsthis game gifted back somehow feel scammed version betterthis reason cant silent years expect good game ok years development timegood potential nice progression system need develop make actually zelda game like gonna coppy cdn worth dissapointment hours alpha hours release progression exp one quest get legendary weapon zone easy cant really think reason play game also want free items free gnome collect loot quit game reload free items may well game hot garbage anyway trash mess put alpha steam instead ill give free item gnome glitch years arecube world gotten lot locations items lost exp levels decided equipment doesnt work go away zone found inexploring game great locations look lot better remember looking alpha years ago going dungeons weird sites pretty funhowever left feeling hollow fully grasped gear items find exploring areas worked starting really weak point fighting mobs took deaths overcome soon enough found rare item basically unstoppable scenario plays every area game put away cool items fought hard get new ones work anytime want change scenery also applies usable key items found regions game finding boat hang glider anything relating pointless step zone item worse could using switch zonesusable items underwhelming usually working door two zone found allowing better forms transportation like boat despite seeming important like spirit bell weather location name updates used lets walk jail barsoverall game feels worse lot ways years ago alpha whole idea game almost purely horizontal progression isnt bad idea current way handled makes feel like nothing work game permanence pointless since gear work anywhere years less content alpha saved whoevers cracked beta key claimed time yearsi bought hay day hype picroma amazing long wish two devs best hope game someday finished hours good time hours gameplay show slightly brighter lamp thanks month old game created years thanks years ago version better years ago great game still good game feels kinda empty without content still recommend game think would like game better years ago hey guys game make

former selflots changes need happen order make game playable ie region locking exploration tools complete removal skill trees mind boggling lack basic introduction base gameplay mechanics longer fun exploration sandbox enjoyed long agothank making sure everyone purchased back alpha got free im disappointed turned hope project recover years development alpha build released public come back little teased content step back core progression system experience skill trees year old version game progression system interesting fails fully realized feels unrewarding game fun first try exploring starting biome find lose equipment must start scratch barring artifacts found granting levels minor improvements swim speed lamp radius utility stats game great potential years ago even current build feeling much worse potential new system still stands theres really nothing actually clearing first region like new game plus absolutely minor unrewarding bonuses every time cross arbitrary border absolutely ruins desire explore provides real sense progression unless sink hours repetitive quests loot grind years development little positive changeits almost game got downgraded im sure someone pick game new fancy people around devs suddenly metaphorically died huge disappointmenteverything promised wasnt delivereda voxel mans sky years expectations somewhere rpg developed alpha version great innovations release version fell short expectations necessary remove pumping system regionlock added interest game simply disappears please return please optimize game years waiting finally released worth itgreat game years waiting since alpha release playing launch needless say worth go years remove things people liked game handed money develop years remove everything game going nice job wollay years remove features nice one wollay years wait worth years waited years hours fun violent disappointment game split near infinite amount regions region effective weaponsarmor use new region like starting game square one played alpha loved like dont buy completely different frankly much worse game hours cant say dont enjoy game like fun definitely needs work hopefully thatll come everyone stops harassing wollay hours im already bored enjoyment restarting every section map alpha lot potential region locked items removed proper xp system implemented would give another chance moment game let edit looks like wollay left us dont recommend better years ago alpha played us like fiddle alpha better seems like bootlegged pawn store version cube world used play wish could back edit saw new website made shame tell thought going get overwhelmingly positive reviews edit deleted blog post seems like cash grab year catfish developer releases alpha alpha fun still alpha developer goes silent half community start think ran money goes almost silent years teasing features years pass almost teased features get added leveling skill tree removed fun removed dont buy game takes meaningful progressiongame shit thisoh wow unexpectedwhen people saying alpha released six years ago better know done something wrong tale two games best game worst game alpha masterpiece hours playable content skill trees opportunities explore needed alpha reach perfection graphics upgrade ability buy house fast travel thats instead got would think inferior game compared alpha sure game looks great doesnt depth levels gone skill trees gone levels game doesnt tell go levels fan base including original alpha buyer thoroughly insulted price dollars save money kids better deals price beautiful game stuck stubborn questionable creator game much potential like describe short form masterpiece game stuck state wollay would come speak say anything hed add items classes skills overarching progression goal itd superb moment gaining lamp increase hours gameplay okay stale empty lifeless worst since release wollay went posting updating daily saying word vanishing pockets full cash nothing else show iti hope speaks updates supports creation shows love community whos years hasnt ever get stage game amazing big beautiful world barren devoid life activity years ago first bought alphathis ea done badly borderline scam big nope one big yikes bit heads review bit depth kinda long dont time tldr bottom post way reviewcube world first foremost game exploring across large voxel built world smacking things till fall apart voxels looting things get stronger core gameplay cube world explore fight grow stronger like many games simple effective formula keeping players engaged reason cube world decided go progression system would seem home rogue lite beyond several reasons giving sort description get starters lets talk exploration way explore grow stronger might seem normal first dungeons getting gear normal right venture little far suddenly find hard earned loot useless game scales gear base level entering zone gear didnt come meaning endless world explore really isnt endless like bunch tiny self contained worlds haphazardly slapped next little regard convenient border indication making accidental crossing inevitable point exploration leads nicely next point actual fights themselvescube world back old days alpha leveling system growing stronger spending points level ups meant always reason get fight matter even little always got something could use form xp new improved cube world leveling thing past effectiveness combat anything else matter based solely gear found meaning certain rank based gear zero reason go back fight enemies good couple rusty swords swinging god killer star great sword mom another nice place shift pointsi god amongst men im dead nothing quite obnoxious powerful gear mean nothing exactly happens moving new zone gotta start way back fighting low level mobs rusty swords gonna powerful old max rank great sword thing get keep rare pieces called relics items give marginal stat boosts things would fine benefit good minute increase travel stats give pathetic one would get dozens see real noticeable benefit meaning start scratch lot get permanent improvement example time first ever relic awarded magic drumroll please faster pet riding well alright doesnt help combat least helps get around faster use bad realize unlock ability ride pet entered new zone unlock ability ride pet new zone dungeon lets could anywhere zone could complete opposite corner zone could last thing find zone unlucky enough yes even tools need required time explore new zone quite reigns ride mount boat sail water glider name three big ones travelso see gameplay loop getting stronger adventure keeping maybe couple tiny rewards starting new adventure something like rogue lite run die buy upgrade gold kept maybe unlocked new item next run runs take half dozen hours took hours taking time get first relic times may vary ridiculous systems like work best run done quickly move next rapid fire name game kind system tiny rewards run globe trotting adventure paceeither system needs removed favor old fashioned leveling system relics need much powerful justify starting scratch every time go new zone even would still end dozens pages inventory space gear dozens different zones want travel back old zone better still old gear starting scratch againbear mind opinion matter might well think game described exactly want game bought six year ago getting update many review see game little wow game part childhood steam lets let nostalgia rosetinted glasses blind us loved game back know much hurts much recommend buying game want people experience joy felt playing back people cant get version anymore one one know much better lets settle lets give honest feedback accept hope wolly listens tldr progression system slow resets progress

game wife help years first started beta confused specifically region locking equipment first thing arent l locked power level goes making high tier item starter weapon first upset cant go explore forever think alpha run around nothing eventually would make new character start nothing right fun ever cube world actually spend time region finding cool dungeons without skipping like would normally become extremely powerful slaying gold tier enemies easy venture new lands new enemies structures spawn powerful weapons armor reduced able find lot personally like new artifact progression system currently seems little slow better nothing like alpha im already level havent left first region hours game play plan playing hundred lot people already said whats bad game buti say big disappointment progression feels like rubber band going back forth doesnt feel like anything get meaning weight zonelevel system makes sense within rpg world played alpha id say would satisfactory fun playing instead rpgs meant make appreciate become connected character world version game feel useless time since know soon enter new zone gear become obsoletedefinitely years worth development feel like wollay wanted get rid cube world hanging head lot people saying new progression system trash imo lot better old levelling system actually makes challenge going new area instead getting best gear one region stomping ones lot people seem hate beta dont really understand changed since alpha yes also years ofc going change long dont mind changes love game great much replayability say hope theyre going add customization later maybe add ability change character towns something able dye armor would pretty great well im looking forward able follow games progress way color waypoint stars would helpful find place want go lot reviews based nostalgia anything game felt fun alpha betayes know endgame sucked adventure way better game much interact beta looks lot nicer alpha game right tho feels like doesnt reward progress scale needs reward system set go area area locked gear leave anytime game strips utility items gear stats artifacts get retain progress doesnt feel strong make progression system like rougelike amazing reddit post makes even examples goes depth wish another way review game rather say yes moment wouldnt suggest getting game seeing game come playing middle school makes sad see amazing exploration game get lot reviews cubeworld quite unfair said however right alpha player received steam version additional costs quite happy game fun really extremely happy skill tree pet leveling removed pets use useless youd level far faster pet hated spending time farming level skill treewollay done great job dungeons questing extremely enjoyable however biggest deal breaker game going back square one entering different region first read thought going across sea another land would reset fine withbut isnt soon step foot another biome boom stuff becomes useless game fun enjoying alpha loot becoming trash region go leveling system needs changed order good game loot based leveling doesnt work functioning player xp essentially someone joins region gear class become god immediantly area making progression really brokenthe go spawn point harder game get shouldnt cap progression continue forever gear always get better bosses always get harder get rid capwollay please dont go quiet please fix game amazing wait id like give positive review lot went wrong game lot missing highly unbalanced quickly lose interest grinding behaviors region locking one im sure point read review explains poorly game made dont expect updates anything developers came quick cash grab catch road another years remake shitstorm however game really fun mods made community buy game strongly suggest download mods implement otherwise youll find spending hours achieve nothing masterpiece shyte wont even work windows gg dig locked discussions find bypass thanks big fu windows userswindows supported ggggggggggggggggggggggggggg fk game nice game gets bit repetitive nice gamecould use pulishing would still recommend nice looking world absolutely nothing novel ultimately shallow experience cube world worth playing alpha years ago many things reworked little content added empty game fun cannot recommend bought potential game years ago would purchase game final product poorly crafted gameevery time character moves new area adventure equipment resets advancement repetitive gathering items new area endless grind trying find fun never arrivesi wish hadnt spent long trying find fun could returned really fun game different alpha thats expected long game fun could still totally worth money opinion really good game even though progression system far optimal sadly wollay developer gone hiding sad disappointment wont speak hype game graphics anything like isnt makes game unfun gameplayi privilege play early version game way back basic game fun ride days worth content appreciate developer wanted make new exploration leveling system help make game stand execution somehow makes pointless progress levels gear becoming useless outside equivalent neighborhood items vanishing thin air moment leave neighborhood makes progression hardly worth whats point game reward hours work half percent total increase movement speedi lost interest game fast funny game polished welltuned around core system broken system minds welltuned regardlessif make suggestion developer wont look reply hardly doubt would would make explore new areas weapons lose strength gradually leave area star loot might become star way progress isnt hampered leaving explore neat ice biome another idea instead items like gliders bells special locations lock stat buffs across land small powers lead something buffs locked behind na enemy encounter boss fight want need explore different biomes area one key item lets say start grass land unlock glider ok cool find bell one dungeon ice area north whistle lava land south get ideai know countless ways improving game seeing months since point dont think wouldnt recommend game current state pick updated reviews changebut could add xp back would happy camper god miss scam wish could refund simplistic game doesnt really fit rpg tag although find game enjoyable isnt progression exp leveling system would great also enemies dont immediately one shot spawn ill leave negative could change sooner later updates roll around hope game teacher told cannot create know initial beta release cube world fantastic game hopeful amazing helped couple rough spots happy place never got updated developer got depressed still lives pc never removed longer possible get itthe released game feels like helpless spiral fight grow work hard build knocked every passing border never really surpass cap grow past certain strength level makes rough able surpass certain encounters especially one two melee classes sad depressing loop begins feel inescapable time exact opposite effect beta theres little way happiness wonder game feels somewhat like beaten dog cowering progressing past confines dark little cornernot games need happy game switched feel dramatically one beta recommend game unless either plan play friendsyou use mods cheats circumvent region locks something base product single player may hoping fori really want recommend game due personal history many hours sank reality sadly cannot recommend current state game without feeling like im baldfaced liar heres hoping wollay eventually reappear update review textbox example refusing feedback community remaining bubble cause make horrible development decisionsi used love game back alpha giving chance poststeam release became horribly clear dev wollay taken made interesting chucked dumpster replacing boring repeating system punished progressiondo buy thuroughly meh experience really pretty package early game tedious mid game actually somewhat enjoyable realize instead going adventures exploring new lands quest away items tools region locked found sailing across ocean discovered would mean character would basically start game scratch new area liked mans sky launch enjoy old school mmorpg questing might find something enjoy otherwise probably wont miss much ton people need review like new game forget know alpha game would good reviews wasnt alpha players complaining different big world much playable classes dont lot depth currently progression towards skills abilitiesthe progression game obtaining artifacts bonuses swim speedmount speed etc barely notice combat game feels like wants dark souls lite able dodge enemy blows use classes utility beat enemies reality easy encounters handful enemy templates act dont require skill beat could ramble im really bad reviewing thingsi enjoyed time playing beta type region wouldnt spend game depth meaningful progression makes feel like actually gained something spending hours one characterthe dev also showed bunch cool content twitter never actually added game fun game action packed world many towns temples lost shines many foes fight wide arsenal items buy obtain many artifacts collect giving bonuses climbing speed weapon damage think give game shot considering game kinda like skyrim cant beat game always something fan demo huge upgrade say try good game gives different experience would get rpg games gives game worth exploration moments ive following game since still lives hype appreciate game become giving pleasant experience game worth playing nice game bit like dd generator hit smaller mobs gear craft move new zone finished exploring start fresh mp fun freinds well gear stay region start next afresh unless gear much much explore like exploring game lot offer game shiny love hermits thumbs note never played first

helps best luck wollay game still developmenti high hopes game believe worth bought wollay still working development plans follow plans game eager see game look like future polished game nicely alpha version bringing formatting rest planned features game aaaah cube world game purchased back available month shop got closedmakes feel nostalgic also regretful state game released beginners rpg turned cobbled together mishmash interesting ideas fight much drains every amount fun game like thirsty vampire desertalso great silence wollay happened players didnt get update years neither game files informations regarding game except screenshots mechanics didnt make game got audience beginner casual gamer normal gamer expertthis game picked pretty much every type player warned mechanics simplistic quite rough unfair game plays like nothing think graphics bad alright good beautiful fantastic well voxel based cubes nothing special look nice animations feel kind stiff dont feel broken place thing noticed shader used alpha made cubes change hue slightly lighting giving something much natural nice touch blocks pretty much look regardless lighting music bad alright good beautiful fantastic thing game really feels whole gets annoying prepared get jumpscare complete quest sound loud difficulty easy average easy learn hard master hard unfairthis one tricky rng kind get really powerful weapon really early game doesnt restrict beginner using weapon easily oneshottwoshot every enemy even bossesif rng kind wont find anything helps getting rid monsters problem take hours getting anything useful problem gameplay section review bugs bugs destroy game lots bugs bugs use speedrun nothing encounteredive yet find mayor bugs except furniture clipping walls weird terrain generation errors put building top another somewhere lurking shadows probably bugs guess wont find done game story none bad alright good fantasticwell none except random generated lore nothing helps understand world cube world works lives breathes oh grave king killed snail neat thats pretty much yes text really something player got beta gameplay frustrating sleepy boring fun challengingthe gameplay oh gameplay opinion pain suffering awaiting brightly coloured worldthe first hours quite fun rngesus kind even find something good probably lose soon becausethe region lock system punishes player exploring advancing game exploration type rpg hinders use gear outside region except gear really frustratingly rare type gear usable kingdom aka region found neighboring regions leave though even rare gear powerful starting gear oh travel gear also usable region found need collect soon everything back probably done regionyou cant get stronger gear find helps survive skills use already unlocked start thats nothing nothing less skill tree nothing cant power character leveling system gear permanent upgrade find extremely rare artifacts region boost travel perks nothing combat stats change artifacts means without gear back square one soon travel another region killed low level mobs get gear puts top everything repeating boring cycle cube world gameplay game time length really short hours short hours hours hours long hours long hours extremely long hours gameplay handled two like set back working way back top without rewarding price game could something invest days worth time dont like set back complete one region seen everything cube world offers gameplay wise accomplished hours depending rng price quality full price wait sale dont buy refund canan explorationdriven rpg doesnt feel rewarding exploring playing like rpg pretty much sums whole debacle cube world whole game feels bland empty content invest money something punishes playing invest time everything every time cross border leaves empty giving feeling advancing getting strongerthis game promising back alpha stages became victim false promises badly handled development lacking communication devs sidemy final rating game dont buy even discounted price high long mayor problems arent fixed seeing wollay tackles problems community brings move get another game aaand im writing short review tooi cant recommend game stage simply games based progression progression implemented solely items items bound regions regions arent big lets imagine earn boat cool right sailing fun might think almost reach ocean biome jump water hitting key beautiful boat reach end current region precious boat soon touch border poof boat anything spent hours looking big mistake changing game way shame honestly would like refund wollay changes progression works cares abandoned neglected might well try trove free steammaybe itll reworked couple years later abandoned developers released halfbaked product felt like cash grab would definitely advise avoiding developer future future game releases try promise itll lead disappointment abandoned years game amazing region locked stuff changesrip cube world abandonware dev ran away money left us unifinished game got good qualities changed shit nobody likes nobody asked hours alpha gameseeing changes say quite refreshing playing gamenot much endgame really love fact start beginning every time switch biomeat beginning might seem hard get first weapon explore freely almosti love game good like exploring hrs love game region locked system refreshing non typical hate many people fact tried create something didnt play like every game makes every region like new play doesnt spoon feed entire time couldnt happier purchase absolute dog shite havnt played single game worse whole lifetimehonestly absolute flaming garbage pile game wanna actually try progress game run straight line careful dont die youll get send right back city started like minecraft minus good bits w added kill quests absolutely one wollay never accept cube world appears dare see could beme playing agree wollay absolutely notas someone paid alpha massive amounts fun waiting six years expecting similar progression content left let immensely progression system borderlandsyinfinite scaling rpg stats skills invest procedurally generated worlds interesting map generation robust customization lacked things like quests general interaction also supported direct ip super bigso beta comes adds quests general interactions everything else enjoyed gutted understanding procgen world replaced static one order make steam integration easier gear get entirety strength skills statlines even gear becomes useless change region makes going friend could hundreds regions away veritable chore interesting landmarks shaders gone specs required jumped arbitrarily game supports gamepads adopts really terrible unscaling ui scheme balance window everything scales much quickercomparing experience power fun say regions alpha felt like slow climb hill logarithmic curve beta many sharp mountains run around getting oneshot even passive mobs happen across extremely powerful gear sitting somewhere become doomguy clear everything enter new region rinse repeatthe rewards clearing region also lackluster best artifacts need clear region earn lackluster best scale incredibly poorly low stat caps every artifact also increases level dont get stat gains anything youll get lamp extends maybe half foot furtherthis seems developers decided erroneously hole work without feedback six years could prevented anyone way reach give feedback originally game much grander set content goals wellit feels like completely different game worse honestly speaking even regret getting hopes owning alpha absolutely terrible compared alpha version game game super confusing slow progression adventure game shouldnt weapons work certain areas stars game absoultly loved beta played hours tried got bored hours actually fun game actually bad good years ago developer money posted one update years waiting since update good ghosted us got game twice please stay away actually pretty good friends really bad without bugs manageable actually cubeworld solid game four classes different specializations quests dungeons interesting lootsystem bossesand play play fun refine character go different quests find items unlock lots stuff everythings finebut happens want go next area well everything gone reset everything except two things money levelthe motivation goneuntil problem solved dont give recommendation buy adventure progression two concepts inherently intertwined explored together countless times thousands different gamestldrcube world adventure game without progression thats bada bit

start another region well im simply due fact theres reason thing real rewardthe lack progression really removes keep playing much loved game play loop dont feel though gain anymore enjoyment simply thing different land would rerolling characterthe artefacts really arent worth trouble go get seems items stay together yes know gear even limited usefinal thoughts game currently lacking reason player interact games mechanics silly sounds players need rewards drive forward otherwise everything feels pointless add meta progression reason continue exploring region basically seen game offer lvls still progress get movement speed nothign else also reagion lock resets items everytime think worth hours game left little burnt lack meaningful character progression gameplay loop charming core regionbased progression interesting concept would like see developed however permanent progression character limited improving traveling capabilities intend play game little get sense class experienced gameplay guardian warrior would recommend starting class specialization would recommend game combat engaging aesthetic attractive heart lovingly crafted indie title present hours say game great fun price thats good valuei understand peoples complaints differences alpha features missing end day wollay pixxies creative project choice direction take inas wollay stated restarted scratch several times major changes expectedwith tweaks artifacts system could great ive fun time playing far continue enjoy colourful world cube world future shame amount people feel butt hurt changes seem simply want watch game burn sad hours gameplay completion close regions safely say havent enjoyed game much years first game feel deserves honest reviewfirst exploration great terrain looks amazing points interest cities ususal well spread making everywhere go something quirks generation like trees inside plateaus water rising ground levels makes fun find explorethe combat cheesy especially early sometimes late game region playing solo say enjoy lot finding edge make bosses circle leading shrines quickly respawn making repeatedly lose interest letting friend bait many ways fight creative way go fight whichever way prefernow game gear based progression region locked gearitems ive seen many complaints dont really see issues first glance looks like severly limits exploration looking deeper really promotes detailed exploration within every region yes losing travel items bit annoying figure things gearing advancing region go quickly besides whats difference monsters getting stronger getting weaker moving next area complaint artifacts kind useless besides showing friendsive played around alpha followed twitter past years see development going agree opinion release underdeliver considering long worked game whatever reasons im blaming project think amazing job could better yes course totally worth keeps development definitely encourage maybe game even surpass expectations hours give honest reviewwhats good fun repetitive every hours repeat youve already done people really love game play nonstop similarly tryhard would play pacman hourswait go sale maybe much think worth least updates hopefully come hours still pretty much appreciate new version cube world careful like alpha version prefer consider whole new game long years cube world back get review want say really wanted enjoy game amount playtime got well worth price far fun game base good adjustments need made game really shine lot issues game appear minor issues made worse bigger issue goes back progression wollay base alpha solid leveling great saying goes aint broke dont fix however tried something new experimented applaud game got put new direction makes feel dozen times fresh would nostalgic factor alonehowever lets get good old positives negatives musical score game amazing brings right feel great graphics good ever better optimization always achievable still pretty great department also base game good got good loop structure nice pets still awesome taming great controls smooth good ever shrines better ever honestly wayy better alpha straight one best improvements alpha regions look awesome map even improvednow negatives starting severeloosing items hang glider boat etc crossing regions bad heavily suggest maybe coming new items games progress make things interesting players get items removed items lost value makes players less interested game loot feels whole maybe instead tiers use item levels accordance far players getting starting region progression feels way fast game gets reset travel new region read last negative negative super importantfor rpg class diversity ability diversity customization isnt time presume added game great game deserves work needs best bepets great dont really feel diverse enough maybe give creatures abilities bond player adding complexity also cool affects choosing pets like bats could maybe shoot like blood shot drop fruit something night time wayyyy dark game brighten light reduce darkness night time bit lot better gui could use bit tweaking terms scaling pretty solidi sure could come honestly let alone issues got fixed game would easy dollars would reccomendbut current issues take solid keep mind average still saying average game honestly still worth every penny lot fun definitely going sink least couple hundred hours game knowing wollay issues get fixed amazing developer honestly looking forward whichever project next long years game waited long outa lot changed since alpha daysthis randomly generated rpglite infinite exploration progressionyour character levels artifacts boosts exploration stats like climbing diving timethe combat feels responsive fun indeed subjective review afterallthe game quite challenging gonna lie darksoulsy feel especially dungeons hard sometimes rewarding finish recieving artifact combat gear locked region though exception called gear rare items find late game every region makes wandering new region feel like new game everytimeall would recommend cube world exactly expected hoped would years give props sole developer wolfram put blood sweat tears passion project hope continues develop game content game infinite potential infinite fun years false promised features got shell great idea original alpha feels better updated version though even lighter content play risk price tag want aim years development hopefully would worth wait years away scene mad lad comes back game less content alpha grabs money hyped hands vanishes really want game go dont buy normal price since clearly overpriced check last update made hasnt touched since released chances wont touched another years time heavily dependent long money made lasts years development game still unfinished days worth gameplay everything starts mean different areas game leave one area gear becomes pointless get new gear area besides gear area specific xp system game currently leveling exist hope game gets finished one day beautiful idea years silence removed best part alpha rgp aspects released trash disappear years thinking money stolen back isnt even game want money back years waiting expecting yes simple grindy times hard times easy love game night time less night really hard see enemies even lantern feels like night time longer day time skill tree give better reason kill mobs wow exp skill tree made invest time game buy recommend watching video cube world first dont like grinding walking long time game isnt years game much content alpha fun play well course things could better region locking almost every item helps progress little frustrating game still fun combat great personally like new system old skill tree give chance pretty great friends years worth wait sixyear hiatus wollay pixxies voxelbased adventure game cube world actually back released many us old supporters put hundreds hours alpha essentially tech demo final product come unique twists previous gameplay changed enjoy polarizing isthe good alpha players got steam keys never ripped many believed long thats good show support game runs well well stable platform unlike venerable minecraft voxel style unique enjoyable also allowing things easily customized future wollay penned soundtrack game sounds fantastic immersive combat feels engaging requiring attention actively dodge aim attacks zones much smaller used much varied extra towns lorebased npcs wander respective zones zonebased events affect youre able giving targets aim artifacts lay hidden zone one increasing abilities time theyre acquired gear upgrades well giving real feel power level later zone get free flight steam friends time flight master move zone time slight caveatthe bad still building feature youre supposed adventure world anyway windows users download unofficial patch deal fact programmed sound handled differently word fix works game released missing certain key features wollay teased years massive cities grand quests leaving progression world feel samey tired may change future artifacts dont boost quite enough leaving player collect dozens feel real improvement unique world seeds one unfathomably huge game world youre still going see place twice unless go way thats place names random though may sometimes nearly varied could find character named ikoka ikoka enchanted forest ikoka hills may problem crafting isnt valuable since resources harder come alpha stay away communityatlarge unless youre sort masochist applies basically game show keep one hat laterthe uglyhow feel regionlocked gear big dividing factor game right get artifacts zone decked legendary gear got toys mobility go next zone lose rather hidden really used last zone earn mobility gadgets gear way last time get new artifacts zone exception gear allows bring next connected zone get headstart many lament makes progression pointless since youre going lose anyway ways theyre right games replacing gear next zone come wont scale meet new enemies cube world backwards since mobs dont levels instead gear scaling need replaced personally dont hate system overlycomplicated bad though need work anathema others inevitably add mod game removing bother play whole game cheapened since zones dont mess stuff leave isfinal judgement buy enjoy bad game shows whats possible team two make relatively cheap good time put dont feel like playing dont need live wait game kind let mean area thing cool becomes repetitive go get items gotten getting new gear wouldve liked seeing increase difficulty next zone gear really isnt good instead useless time playing since alpha thought six years game would changed better guess im wrong cant recommand game claims cube world knew loved eternity silence devs came back released steam likely milk extra cash new unknowing playersthey also somehow managed take good game throw window hour testing due recommendation friends refunded game wasnt fun another problem seemed graphics everything cubeshaped obviously correctly rendered shame beta tester game found really fun hours ive really explored area im still finish due bad gear drops honesty reason warrior gear yellow barely dropped alottttt room improvement quality life improvements long gets updated improved incrementally cube world amazing doubt though wait see game goes hats wollay excited game since loving beta quite cannot support suggest game anyone considering many backsteps taken development instead adding onto superior alpha build instead scrapped entirely remade game scratch added less content didnt promise showcasing years borderline scamming remaining playerbase permanently leaving bad taste mouth indie game fanssay want minecraft least minecraft didnt openly lie customers strip away features running away money like happened game wollay already shut devblog gone silent supporters money say least game dead dirt taken steam due game massive scam funded development years present cube worldyou start journey realize quickly difficult one overcome obstacles acquire gear reading lore talking artifact hidden nearby completing quests finally take clear end dungeon reward sailing speed artifact maybe next increase valuable stat like damage using newly improved sailing speed set new region three minutes traveling straight line suddenly drop water special items vanished gear useless staring blue thing think say thoi recommended alpha based upon potential actually released like unless nostalgia game like likely hard pass oddities get addressed completing regions hours safely say enjoyed game cannot recommend anyone current state point feel like ive almost seen everything game offer terms progression need play games current state lot issues game makes feel like progressing starting first time exciting exploring find landmarks however trying find gear upgrade first time difficult trying kill green higher enemy starter equipment difficult task small chance getting new piece gear may even class youre playing finding landmarks important find key items able use locked away items mobility items traverse world quicker gear increase overall power problem arises stumble across high rarity item like star star weapon find piece gear youre essentially steamrolling game first satisfying able melt enemies giving hard time afterwards though finding village find quests landmarks increase power since piece high tier equipment difficult complete quests gear point almost risk fighting anything even bosses hitting stars weapon armor level pretty much clear dungeons collect artifacts region artifacts increase combat stats climbing speed light radius diving skill minuscule amount clearing dungeons region measly percent per artifact stats feels bad gives real incentive really continue exploring regions artifacts however felt needed try another region give game another chance soon go new region star gear reduced back starter gear one worst things game way get around grind piece gear supposedly get completing region random chance works neighboring zones however leave zones item useless starter gear drop rate items rare found despite clearing whole zones completely grinding hour high level boss quest knowing going village find quests using map find top priority find high tier piece equipment get ball rolling getting regeared much faster time started feel bored feeling stronger first zone clearing dungeons measly artifacts feel satisfying first zone felt like replay entire game gameplay loop feels nonexistent felt need play longer need fact gameplay loop feels like downgrade alpha disappointing escalating difficulty flat reset feel like exploration rpg game felt like playing weak rogue like minuscule upgrades carrying materials consumables enjoy time playing game time felt like tedious busywork scouring every inch land find new landmarks lore complete zone however environments explored vast beautiful lot charm packed every little detail game however gameplay want keep exploring beautiful world lot improvements could made current time cannot recommend anyone get game countless hours gameplay alpha hours still recommend gameyea gameplay features overall addictive play reach certain level milestone eventually come back wonderful world friends even better played alpha beta last week mixed thought overall game terrible like type game isnt people put nearly hours path exile honestly game nice chill experience features arent really everyone looking forward updates future game offer sure modding

version written game drain game along couple ea projects got went sideways permanently ended interest prerelease backer gamefast forward years heard released steam skeptical year development cycle game simplistic earned mountain money alpha backers screams problematic turns skepticism well placedwhat utter failure release version game went somewhat interesting infinitely scaled yet raw unpolished game alpha getting unpolished uninteresting final release microscopic nearly flat progression fact pretty much armor items reset crossing invisible barrier would enough discourage playing xp system really anymore casts game trash binfor love gaming dont buy game would take miracle developer make steam version game appealing even dated basic many games better job doesnt even come close

punishment playing game used play game beta much polished loved mess voxels ah yes game big nice ah cube world game hadnt received update years straight nowhere revealed release gamethe game different alpha version player alpha hundreds hours say know difference alpha version game progression worthwhile yes alpha version fun times overall beta lot fun levels boosted stats linear progression skill tree could go ever wanted use new skills anywhere beta version changed played beta awhile writing review surely say lot different sense progression isnt thrown away except artifacts get later version game still kill enemies gain gear like usual whats problem might ask whenever leave region got gear automatically becomes practically useless use region got thing happens special items specials things like hang gliders region bound progress short answer really dont find artifact item gives stat boost boost often low isnt even noticeable pet speed artifacts pet speed went isnt damage boosting artifacts either mobility onesbut doesnt mean game bad playing lot fun new structures dungeons added made lot fun explore region size smaller structures packed together closer lot easier find something added skills class making lot fun attack fight enemies added music game sounds amazing game really needs tweaks progression feel worthwhile artifacts give stat boost damagehp boost etc artifacts introduced players lot hours game shouldnt level guy minutes leave regiondespite changes criticism give game good review really enjoyed fun ah cube world think new players case didnt know games first alpha released years ago people played alpha experience quite different one presented upon release current game version version quite different alpha number bad wayslist exp skills

negative feedback deter improving game good chunk us giving constructive criticism said though cant recommend game even like aspects game ipersonally think good place start remove regionlocked mechanic breaks enjoyment game encourages explore world yet punishes making gear utterly useless means gotta mindlessly farm hopes getting decent gear class course mean player keeps best gear times

looking towns enter new region towns also pretty cut dry real difference outside aesthetic ive explained problems fixed first two steps capitals arent necessary theyd add sense life world really needing finally listen community iits thinks game isnt good right look upon many many reviews game gotten youll see im alone go far better detail games problems ways fixed alfa version super good bring steam say motivationincentive progress game level within game know get grind meters lamp radius gear progress unique items reset per area explore infinite exploration game get punished iti recommend game anyone current state around lovely game years take away content wont get couple hours gameplay unless love grinding unbelievably repetitive game rewards run faster literally worth space takes steams store best features standard elements rpg taken since alpha released character progression solely done obtaining stronger weapons armor found quickly randomly ending challenge enemies would otherwise give rewarding receive strong weapons armor however become useless travel new area character effectively resets traveling new region something many times wish play game hours cycle becoming strong becoming weak far fast repetitive fun made worse fact little difference regions youll end barebones quests lasting rewardthe best part alpha reward spending hours leveling character occasionally finding gear upgrade knew would last many hours gameplay completely gone almost zero reward killing enemiesdont buy game major updates fix huge shortcomings years waiting fully rewarded new features like quests changes classes items gather zone instead skill points everything way fun previous version ill advise novice players never played cubeworld watch gameplay first tutorial explanations thoa blast people already played game gladly rediscover steam things considered good timewill continue enjoy game friends solohowever perfect exp system alpha way satisfying gave much gratificationskill trees added fun variationregion locking loot like winning prizes fair confiscated exitthe beta feels like completely different much better game alpha progression wiseoverall content good visually beautiful soundtrack fitting creates nice atmosphere lot fun play friends still journey ahead find item allow keep stats large radius spans across regions allow really love game early access came steam full release big let although game looks beautiful simple yet fun mechanics game falls quickly completing first zone time finish zone move next gear becomes useless start square one stay first zone much therethis makes lot replayability however going new zone difficult establish top makes previous accomplishments seem kind hollowoverall think could still incredible game current state little offer almost every mechanic seemed half baked charm mostly fluff enough meat sustain attention longer hours almost everyone played loved alpha hates game tell something absolutely recommended current state alot people seem hate game absolutely reason hard start think engage enemy picking fights either overpower maneuver exploration level grinding people really think keep high level equipment across new areas stomp even challenge like whatthe thing agree see people say cannot use equipment areas sense handglider boat reins honestly get game like good adventure game like plow jrpgs alpha fun alpha player bought game day one super excited game honestly want better experiences go play alpha version alpha way fun beta versionbeta essentially becomes tolerable get better gear getting point insanely fun friend gave gear could play together friend giving gear isnt something required start sort funi want like game instead improving good model game alpha went curved path picroma shut others updating game turning game like hate situationmy personal suggestion dont get version cube world find way play alpha wait picroma major updates change game functions someone manages mod cube world half player base wants listyou pet dogs reallynew biomes fun look interesting inclusion new dungeons quests unlock via skill tree boat glider usage adding lore interesting able see landmarks via mini map close new mobs added new landmarks visit biome generation cleaner new river spawning multiple layers levels fun see list way dark night nearly impossible see anything possessed humans towns attack fact waypoints dont auto mark flute playing required enemies attack waypoint sometimes start game camp ohko region locked gears pets vehicles channeling inner ign much water boats region locked exp level think possible make exp leveling cube world felt like small mmo alpha exp takes away initial charm say exp isnt possible isnt polished enemy scaling everything one two shot way bright vibrant color choices compared alpha feels like gammabright theres high contrast fact press ctrlscroll zoom character cant walk use map anymore towns lack lighting feel way dark night lack explanation game throws learn towns markers via map zoom drink potions full health game doesnt stop didnt alpha caves skylights even night lack skill tree think people hoping interesting detailed skill tree none saddening extra character customization dying often get teleported super far away makes highly annoying get back idea go start stamina breathing water meaning run stamina jump water actually drown asap waste enough time get endgame besides last boss easy game essentially forces new region want another challenge return essentially start scratch mobs possessed slime case chase forever leaving either die lead mobs kill hard make healing items small creeks seems everything big rivers ocean lakes minimap huge obtrusive list alpha player bought release played hours ill try keep clean promisesif first time seeing game review pretty good last hours really milking theres lot stuff explore find days im still seeing new things forums subreddit systems right fine new player expectations thus wont really seem like huge problems weird design decisions keep eye made mostly guy know else stardew valley early minecraft developer socially challenged dont expect proper communication upcoming features rational behind design choices kinda gotta take make something play millions games deserve time attention know didnt finish witcher cowardnow rest us familiar almost year old dramabeta extension full release fixes alphas fundamental problems lack content level characters infinite scaling making invincible god hours solutions adds combat somewhat half bakedresetting equipment special items entering new region worthless gold relic system reliance questsif youre reading youre probably familiar sides argument chances well game probably wont change foundation easy seeing creator spent past years building ideal world relics pick would give combat stats misc stats instead misc even better original spawn point went stronger monsters bigger relic bonuses dont need anything crazy like movement speed increases small incremental changes like tempo increase weird bonuses like upon roll gain movement speed buff seconds already mod region locking shows exactly happens take brakes realize shallow really game loop hunting next artifact effectivly making something closer rougelite rpg goal execution flopped unless someone wants link gear stats artifact stat rolling pool probably stay floppedcube world still little indie game flew close sun years ago different face get first relic see light radius kinda kicks wind sails assuming wife dont simultaneous mental breakdown go missing another years updates addressing issues nobody know actually looking kinda cube world right problems big addressed hopefully maybe dont get update forums twitter anything like month wait mod class action lawsuit coinflip communityedit remember said looking long wife dont tuck shells like scared somewhat socially challenged turtles surprise tucked ghosted us know whatif doesnt come back time dont care modding community showing promise unlike alpha mods questionable people actually give shit like games mods main issues fixed overall experience betterwe artifact stat bonuses weapon xp world generation building commands monk class revival mechanic start second time hes ghosted us cube world promising game terrible developer im shocked hope tbh almost year silence im willing admit hopeful mess dont let stop playing still recommend cube world sale especially mods alpha tester ill short onecombat uninteresting thats bad really enjoyed alpha version combat skill tree removal destroyed sort dynamics game first placeenemies strong point seeming unintentionally time found running throughout game running simulator looking enemies actually sort fighting chance hopes finding better gearleveling removal bad idea implementation terrible coupled region locking gear makes game repetitive boring regression rather progression really something want play long think level removal could justified gear get region would different function different regions stats ie better climbing stronger attacks certain creatures defense poisons etc love graphics unfortunately graphics equate good gameplay variety bright colors beautiful lighting although find somewhat annoying running dark dying high level enemy could see feet front even lantern absolutely adorable characters creatures found throughout game could go think probably strongest point gameallinall would recommend game current state game obviously potential great sadly marred terrible progression combat pretty much regardless pick fight vice versa certainly fun elements game many alpha version many removed also whered additional content developers tweets go looked awesome sad game worked drastically change like graphics would willing spend dollars meansone last note developer seems quite talented craft degree shame see state really looking forward replaying updated cube world met starting scratch way hope developer reach community feedback id certainly willing help way anyone things getting sort message across someone using ddos attack malevolent forms attack help get something want someone look find stupid idea saying thats happened dont know anyway heres hoping better future gameedit short though going digress alpha blah blah blah game great ton fun playing game hours sessions love sounds exploration progression overall feel game alpha better far version still fun sometimes id get sale alpha better imo alpha better beta want love game much cannotthings gamecharacter levellingskill treespet skillsmore classesmore racessub classes sure theyre game momentthings gameregion locked looti add soon cant bothered finish review eggs alpha player let fill among voted negative game first gear resetting isnt terrible judging people complaining exploration alpha way easy youve settled legendary gear weapon entering new continent rebuked gear gives fresh start start grinding better gear section sure may get repetitive continent along artifacts obtained wont serve much purpose anymore yet game years ago fun experience still believe still could one give time moment needs developsecond stated partially earlier sentence still development devs still room grow change early pass negative verdict slow paced development game experience ive kickstarted game took equal years done released people seem find worth valued wait wellnot trying defend game like heart soul feel lot unnecessary hate perceive standing angles fairness considerd game beta undergoing early access alpha player herethis game gave much hope future six years later thats end world tho broken least see inside buildings people well makes playing hard fun fixed wont playing anyone thinks end gaming pc drivers updated working last night tried minutes would love tell everyone think changes dont like exp region lock cant really dont want play game broken hopefully play update reviewupdate well got working launching folder steam fixed graphics bug actually got playthis would like tell everything great case removal exp leveling makes game feel unrewarding dont want quest clear area enemies get new powerful piece equipment descale go new zone locking special items like boat glider dont really bother equipment thing silly removal exp leveling took feeling progress leveled got new skill point maybe unlocking new skill use new item makes game unrewarding quite frankly empty sure world really cool map system fantastic gameplay repetitive little reward dont see pointi think game still chance becoming something great take time happens many years already waiting many realistically stay interested maybe year two look back see things fixed fun put back expanded upon im doneps download program tricks game removing region lock helped keep going another hour two still enough take hours time id download alpha build really want play cube world fun version alpha player reviewthis quite disappointing long time wonder took long remove many good mechanics wants game exploration walk broad landscapes see little quests come across way could slowly gather stuff journey make stronger fight powerful enemiesit gamethe exploration fully limited forcing player find tool make exploration manageable punishing player moving far spawn point regionlocking equipment think kind misguided attempt balancing late game something unacceptablethe leveling system removed equipment basically theres levels listed equipment unable find real difference even better quality gear improvements minor even worth anyone want attack speed upgrade thats get good equipmentthere used lot potential game need full rework actual gameplay order even worth considering alpha player wanted love betarelease sadly seems gone backwards terms gameplay forwards feelsbadman alpha ver better alpha version content felt like wouldnt recommend also treat beta version might get content another years alpha version hours hours funbetarelease version hours hours funi got bored game hours lost adventure soulin new version many cool items eg map quests treasures map also killing adventure filling quests need completed bored iteration quest items need gathered every zone almost killed etc literally cant ride another zone rains regionlocked tooalso many cool changes world generator ive play hour alpha review alpha version significant better case beautiful neat new version still looks fine many elements looked harmonic objective find internet comparison old new ocean biomessomething get wrong game six years silence moved wrong direction thinkin opinion alpha version significantly better current version good still play ityou buy play probably fun probably want go another biomeregion maybe repeat cycle times eventually got bored enough forgot game alpha version fun followed wollay twitter see could get nice updates seen twitter cool version also many things got weird removed hope dude improves game next years feedback instead seen breath wild great could great game fucked much grindnot diverse items also fucked combat system seems underwhelming balancedif wanna give tryplay offline mode like may want refund hours costs way much might buy sale gets updated time alpha fun version play one quiet boring spent hours clear zone basically get artifact doesnt increase nearly anything repeat progress traveling takes forever specially get instantly killed game choices made version bad exp system traveling takes forever spawnpoints pain changing zone basically resets ill change review change boring broken game alpha great thing whilst beta definite highlights stripping away things made cube world great beginning left us empty shell im sad mad enjoyed alpha enjoyed beta short region alas finally rest goodbye cube world alpha amazing played time waited years game update add loved beta came clearing zones found disappointed recommend game anyone timei hope make better updates even though hyped friends past couple years turn around tell hours beta game current state terribly dull things made great gone cry ever night since beta could alpha awesome actually fun play full release however alpha better alpha better alpha better alpha better alpha better alpha better alpha better alpha better bs alpha better hope community mod never trust dev alpha better somehow took bunch fun stuff probably figure community dislikes changes though change review alpha better still glad play tough alpha better beta alpha better beta wouldnt recommend current state alpha better alpha better thats shame also worth recommending due lack contentthe solution content draught created meaningless grind opposed sense character development graphics nice aesthetic style pleasant sound effects pretty basic music although fitting also quite bland alpha better worth alpha brokenbeta broken differently mecanics could good without region lock better link regionsrelease missing many contents alpha announced game first went sale vision see future critics listened todo fun cube world yes fun would recommand game state alpha far better beta beta unplayable alpha much better beta fact lose weapons change regions terrible alpha much better launcher doesnt workregion locked gear equipment sucks fun game alpha much rewarding fun play alpha good fun wasted money alpha way better lmao alpha way better response creators updates anything obviously cash grab partvery disappointed high hopes able play friends alpha version ported steam check mate id play hours budslosing gear zone zone tho biggest thing originally enjoyed years ago exploration thats longer optionif game ever fixed allowing mods otherwise ill probably change review hopes crushed alpha way better wish would never released could hope meme good release day absolute garbage alpha way better alpha worth came current one wouldnt even play even free alpha would nice alright im going real really like game heres thing people want levels progression feels ton skill trees different abilitys maybe even passive ones feels like ton progression probably lesson difficulty lesson difficulty practicly unplayablei enjoyed alpha much better added instead making whole new systemi cant call rpg way right though thoughts rpgs skills levels thats alright tough one absolutely loved alpha flaws still fun mechanics changed best faith recognize system right broken imo system need slight adjustments penalty changing regions little nonexistent essentially actually like fresh start changing regions excpecting game change alot people fit standards retarded im thatnow ive seen big part community berating ground anger deserves critisism course fine line critisism outright insulting let man give time redeem right world angry agree see perspective needs fixing dev team give breathing room alright need place much emphasis gear levels reason majority people tie value trophies numbers form accomplishmentthe new direction game taking moving away classic numbers games clearly focusing journeyyou need play game friends enjoy journey tying much epic sword koth tol zarrak instead laughing time autistic friend charged hive hornets diedif want play numbers game go play wow dont mean mean way play game clearly directed banging head meta climbing gear ladder wollay please expand concept make great make journey focus thus far enjoy although dont like region lock fixed simple implement mod really like game find lot fun think wait till gets fixes changes unless friends willing play mod blast although ton people arms differences alpha game bought years ago promises dev update finish product time absolutely love gotten well worth entertainment sure levelling system different dont think leads less enjoyment wish lore dungeons worlds would little varied thats certainly within games right continue growing although alpha player love game come many complaints game game im sure many people would agree personally think zonebased items rpg adventure game completely pointless makes everything accomplish zone feel obsolete believe cause problems new players full release may feel disappointed almost every bit progress zone lost feel like could sorted conquer every point interest zone zones items become items also think defeating enemies unrewarding exp skill upgrading system mention defeating enemies purely luck based close skill required purely based gear alpha player point makes feel overwhelmed underpowered could take enemies much stronger skill win another point id like quickly make also lose key items upon entering new zone make adventuring eventually become tedious enjoyable really bad rpg adventure game believe made key items stay upon entering zone however finding key items new zone key item gets small buff eg small boost hang gliding speed one final point id like make artifacts feel unrewarding buffs gives far teeny meaningful boost believe way improve would add skill point system artifacts give skill points add stats skills subclassdo recommend believe time effort working community recovered although changed lot since alpha still great game many fun things although conventional rpg years ago still great game fair price new players using conventional xp levelling system quite strange first continue explore finish quests end lot fun may everyone amazing game still although perfect takes bit get feet first game really enjoyable fun friends find clearing areas starting friends join get gear although changes would neat fleshed overall hands worse alpha definitely worth purchase hopefully mods come fix dont trust tiny dev team even want fix although game still bugs development neededthe game fun lets explore vast world filled adventure decide play one choses go foward game needs updates development dedication support take game full potential fun absolutely fun fun like beta way exp system go skill tree thought region lock idea would good balancing areas thinking going back old save file play feel like progressing anywhere im running around enjoy quests doesnt feel rewarding going pyramids beta beating boss something beating dungeon actual quest feel better real quest isnt flavor anymore many good things removed excited game still going play pure love beta man disappointing bring back exp system stupid artifacts bring back skill tree get rid region locks balance game like fun like beta confused watched people play game six years ago excited play game different thing seems art style supposed playing im little confused exploring seems like fun get creamed easily quests much quests go fight bit unstructured difficult start amazing game highly recommend ive played since alpha amazing game except alpha better original amazing game waiting years moment became playable love amazing game really felt depth playing game first spent hours trying figure kinda sucked first grasped adventure took flight amazing experience hoping future updateskind regards guy love game amazing game glad made comeback amazing game worth visuals alonegameplay fun well super openended whatever like youre forced specific quest anything also theres secrets people game havent discovered yetdont listen outrage try tbh great amazing game didnt get hooked game since little probably follow developement since first blog posts im happy see finally become reality got good couple hours week already im nowhere near getting bored yet diverse biomes region based progression keeps game fresh challenging times one games keep coming back every get bored time verdict definitely recommend bucks steal honestly amazing game love human buy amazing title screen simulator truly stunning wonder actual game better title better ign amazing worth wait absolute tragedy never really got game since finally releasing steam thought itd good opportunity play remember times actually play old version game times pretty good however new version game full flaws like seriously every time enter new area gear becomes trash state progression game genuinely depressing wouldnt recommend anyone game adjustments made judging creator handling situation dont think ill ever recommending amazing game amazing title developed couple blast play friends awsome game would fix like old days endless adventure pointless empty progressionoh boy ill start one pro game aesthetic look beautiful despite blocky manages separate another minecraft clone thats good cuz nothing like minecraft cube worldonto bad alot changes alpha used make game wonderful progression fun leveling acquiring skills good mayve slow progressing getting stronger could upgrade customize gear enhancing progression literally removed progression permenant anymore everything region based gather gear get key quest itemsand progress region soon leave region useless used boat dont soon pass region line hp drops back first started game damage becomes pathetic time find gear jump cliff use glider cover good ground fall like idoit longer glider youre used literally fighting one region near region line fighting star enemies accidentally crossed line didnt notice region change hp dropping nothing engaged star enemies got immieadtely doesnt feel good leave region try gather gear relics thing doesnt get made useless upon region change doesnt enough offset exploration grinding get star gear back honestly pathetic base progression relics difference someone level someone level someone got relics small percentage differences lamp radius swim speed climb speed gliding mount speedits disappointing mess couldve much relics even hyped read certain relic someone traveled another region learned mana transformation power surged lore stuff nothing like found ring talking climb faster incredibly fun game back alpha came still fun negative reviews mainly people upset minor changes made beta cant get getting perfect game envisioned paid way back wheni highly recommend getting game especially friends game finally came played hell alpha version game mainly pvp server unfortunately dedicated pvp server release impossible also combat changes pvp awful im fine since game great playing solo cooperativewell progress system people dislike really far weve got alpha opinion however need tweaks sure find good enough actually like progress system works im region im still impressed gorgeous game looks also good variation landscape biomei enjoy cube world mostly exploration aspect makes continuously play never get bored find funny dont want play another class im constantly progressing ninja character havent explored every biome variation yet love visuals also love taming pets like npcs wave dance soundtrack excellent one per biome eg ocean biome changes points interest ui much clean however hotbar goneim currently level means got artifacts collect artifacts main objective cube world dont go explore new biome artifacts rewarding enough make excited go another region one problems game dont really care honestthe game lacks tutorial player friendly dont piece information play inside game causes people hate game misinformation recommend check tips creators twitter pixxie tips forum go official site playingthats im glad finally play full version game wolfram created im waiting new content coming soon score id give game current state much come release weve seen twitterthis game awesome recommend apparently game still development wollay sharing details public thru emails hope thats true people aware fact one guy making game full time span six years fun project calm flaming hot cheeto fingers lick dorito dust sweaty nerds game tho looking forward wollay future game artifacts need relevant order provide steady gameplay loop feels rewarding still consider got moneys worth though support game future first time player gamethis adorable love lot keep amazing work child loved alpha remember playing nephews brothers hours end game amazing back hearing game going released excited get back friends online even purchased game extremely disappointed outcome years updates game feels like everything could gone wrong game xp progression system like gear locked certain zone even bother going next would start every time walked certain distancei tried really hard find good aspects game find limited even want need continue im going start every time ill back anything positive towards game made stands wouldnt pay dollar game truly sad dude spent hundreds hours alpha six years ago instantly fell love game heavy heart leave negative review pros beautiful looking game exploring world feels great utilites combat funcons progression incentive keep playing got bored hours reward completing area grinded hours complete first area find gear would disabled next region got keep artifact made lamp glow bit brighter falsely advertised rpg rpg elements left game rpglike feature select character starting screen upgradable skills left game decision making xp even upgrading weapons gems useless since lose soon cross bordersummary core design game needs rework either bring back old leveling system form progression least give artifacts stats actually matters small combat stats increases would fine would probably give motivation play game hundreds hours even better added unique stats effects artifacts could customize build character something needs change never play game fan cube world available roughly years ago enjoyed immensely fast forward years extremely sparse communications times thought project dead teasers systems like questing gave us hope suddenly receiving notification steam release new version really ramped excitement anticipation beloved game would finally feature complete assume many others either stayed late got early download early release beta great excitementthe sets scene disappointment soon followed sure teased features game however whole game changed fundamentally gone gentle progression finding loot defeating enemies staples rpgs indicators progression removed follows xp gain equivalent indicator progression completely removed fighting pretty much waste time avoiding overland combat way go seems fight seems character incapable learning successful fight xp level gain meant represent order progress must find artifact region along dungeon gear basis progression isnt necessarily terrible concept however game cross regions lose gear benefits essentially making start beginning ill admit dont understand latter part implemented dont find fun leads becoming powerful within region cross invisible zone border essentially get reset back beginning warning without kind reasoningthere exist plus gear indicated sign retain benefit across adjacent zones found yet even eventually become useless away move artifacts grant small bonus movement type stats however kind useless current implementation really much reward clearing zone mob strength horribly unbalanced right die lot fighting even lowest level critters may forced slay puppies bunnies although imagine tweaked pointconclusion game current state feels like hill grind master zone feel like achievement first time dropped cliff new zone grind loop simply uphill climb drop cliff rinse repeat want explore world find fun disincentive actually explore reset every zone simply isnt game fell love enjoy direction gone long developer hiatus fan original implementation direction seemed going nonzero chance dislike current implementation always reserve right change opinion facts cause wish developers well cannot recommend game currently former alpha thing say im really sad game ive tried enjoy see picky changes didnt expect game fun ive following game years passion love completely died reason played long sake old memories unfortunately stay pastrest peace cubeworld really hope wollay dont go missing recognize project kept shut long dead long time supporter unfortunately disappointed become project become drastically different spirit game originally however im still willing give wollay benefit doubt use honest relevant criticism make game better learn mistakes dont go silent us give us least roadmap future content youve tested last years lolfor new players picking first time definitely interesting experience yet replayability still seenfor returning old players keep open mind different thats alpha development goes anymore alpha still found online b conclude recommend game current state honestly bafter hours gameplay ive played regions completion certain point everything carbon copy different skin top meaningful character progression storyworld based progression systems youve zone hopped times start wonder whats really goal keeping engaged b updates prevail coming months see game community thriving longterm bbest luck next months wollay co still keen see go new player im loving game love wondering around exploring something new old cube world player im sad wait going lie game wasnt sold website downloaded cracked big brain wollay stopped selling level warrior account level rogue account exited heard coming steam hoping see good advancement updates wollay years saw product upgraded downgraded sadly old cubeworld better skill tree leveling system even maybe new crafting recipes new mobs items rpg game levelingproper level trees etc essential wollay threw away mechanics im satisfied long wait game actually become something good play playing old version much fun reasonable new players recommend playing old version sadly find somewhere else download cracked player play alpha cube world must state experience game absolutely freshit seems reviews people played alpha happy way wollay changed direction gamenow watched quite amount gameplay new cube world buying indeed pique interest think region lock mechanic im seeing alot people complain perfect could definitely handled better really bad least gives nice incentive keep goingi think system perfect feel like negative reviews fans vision game also completely understandable teasers wollay posting depicted different things coming game like skill tree didnt make release however things change game development changes still first iteration game personally feel game even amount playtime sinked highly recommend want new unique rpg experience amount updates wollay could give game extremely high looking forward even content time goes solo project game quite impressive sound effects music delightful proc gen terrain second none opinion general flow within single zone good think wollay great foundation build one critique want compelling bridge get zone zone impactful dungeon rewards maybe perks harder endgame zones enemies etc alpha backer brings smile face game still needs iron flaws like miss form skill choice besides subclass options something pets like way going right trying something different ive enjoying far difficulty high first soon find flow slowly accumulate items gets better something god kill anything plan carefully try tactics every step way one boss might need head tactic another might require pet tank make use roaming allies enjoyed challenge far hope keep expanding way im excited content whenever may come right ill need loads hours explore new sights areas gather lore artifacts alpha supporter lot say game positive negativethe visuals pretty charming creating unique came trove art style stayed true way release gameplay mixed bag many reviewers already written feels like long endless grind without major rewards untraditional loot system ask players fitting game overall game feels per experience extremely polished well made bugs weirds far apart however feels like game missing content end game goals booting game feels new refreshing exciting quickly loses steam becomes repetitive grindy game special players best played one friends dont fit either would recommend trying totally different alpha game old alpha player super hyped news cube world upcoming releaseafter played minutes became clear wasnt cube world playedthe game kept name art style thats iti decided give game chance hoping would find stuff like itlets clear current state beta cube world one worst game played year tried multiple time time end using close game frustrationeverything wrong every system flawed still think game saved updates still think problems deeply rooted wontcant addressed properly without completely rethinking game ok lets start goodthe game cute didnt evolve much since alpha version thats good thing animations simple work well art styleyou still create character choose classthe movements fluid running climbing feels goodand thats pretty much biggest problem cube world progression probably worst thing comes rpgwhat mean cant keep gear areas way find gear star even work couple areas still useless others combine fact cant gain exp anymore get super frustrating game never rewards wayshow level simple need explore map find artifacts gives useless buffs works area found found something like level gain pretty much nothing yayof course loot gear monster super low drop rate time cant equip another class well need able kill thatwhen start youre basically worst fighter existence cant even kill chicken depending classwarrior pretty good parry ranger gets obliterated two hits even weakest enemiesso basically youre walking get artifacts carefully avoiding enemies area really huge sometimes walk min even without seeing single temple places teleport resurrect get one shot enemy couldnt see redo min walk either youre lucky drop level weapon class first enemy get play game youre youre walking walking dying walking walking dying get pointthe game developed without ever consulting players shows many levels hurtsits like everything good alpha lost makes sadthere seem lot hate game forums pains spend time writing review thought important care game old player coming back relive experience im pretty disappointedevery time enter new zone gears stats get set back become pretty much useless honestly lot fun playing first zone started knew time enter zone gear gets basically locked instead taking new gear harder zone gear downgrades new zone slightly difficult anyway makes lack sense achievement satisfaction discovering new powerful gearwhen get rare item meant feel awesome gets downgraded minute leave zone feels like cheap mechanic squeeze playtime people results making people feel unnecessarily annoyed pissed good game designas og player im disappointed happy majority mechanics old game wanted new content update delivered decent amount content new progression system sucks much draws away everything great updatemaybe new player might fun picking first time going open mind might cup tea might next game looking considering many others waited almost years progression system enjoyed removed honestly disappointedperhaps mind change future ive played really isnt fun edit mind still hasnt changed annoying wollay left us dark beautiful fun first played alpha disappointing game turned would still recommend played around hours enjoyed greatly isnt perfect many problems isnt complete garbage like reviews say changes think like progression isnt tied leveling anymore meaning wont actively looking group friendly npc clean area get cheep exp still get loot almost worth enemies arent strong enough case dont think npc survive fight let alone new artifact system encourages explore whole region instead aimlessly changing location hopes cheesing enemies one region locked items prevent changing areas please forcing craft gear stand chance another area way enemies dont scale hp make feel like dont progress hand scailing enemies stay becoming weaker weaker untill one shot anything isnt bossthis changes might bit pain improvements dont exhaust gameplay fast keeps new biomes locked actually earn progress towards still arent locked able move new area time want great foundation game current state cannot recommend reviews explain current gear system artifact system lack feeling progress made game leaves wanting additionally content worked seemingly didnt make final game posted various places internet including developers personal twitter main website absent final version im unsure reason developer said started game scratch multiple times point could eliminated either way current game leaves wanting systems place work tweaking additions could end becoming fantastic game needs updating things went previously im sure worked hopei update review future updates improve game game isnt wanted progression gone exact thing made game popular gone left complete remake game least thats looks might sill redeemable everyone let would difficult thank alpha relased wolley thank leaving game completely dont think game recover however get updated see youll changed cant recommend game might biased playing alpha come expecting built watered rpg elements removed actual leveling kept fighting system enemy difficulty progression feels tedious rewarding hours playing accomplished little nothing region locking equipment movement itemsside note movement items game turns walking simulator time since lost everything moving new region also avoided oceans like plague didnt want spend hours swimming around finding boaton hand really well put together bugs everything works designed besides small value changes madethe reason feel like new system doesnt work well alpha progression strictly relative spawning world new character versions left powerless nonforgiving land full creatures would almost always one shot alpha version run around scrape xp loot could weaker creatures cumulative accomplishing task rewarded experience stronger gear grew better chance surviving future situations eventually would strong area would start exploring outward away region starting one stronger mobs dungeons would get leaving challenging enemies needed get stronger order fight leveling also rewarded increasing ability travel since walking time consuming good scaling rpg mechanic let player control difficulty willing challenge according difference strengthin beta run around scrape loot could weaker creatures promise would temporary increase ability fight cases ability fight adjacent regions walking around couple hours collecting bunch quest items became able ride pet hand glide open new areas new key items would eventually collect equipment could actually use strong enough get artifacts new way increase noncombat stats lucky enough artifacts didnt get put lamp radius increases whole meters per artifact artifacts region nothing left offer walk next nearby biome lose glider pet reigns ect everything point one shotting need spend hour walking around get town repeating process region sort rpg mechanic instills nonscaling artificial difficulty curve get powerful enough instead enemies getting stronger ability kill strong enemies taken away rather character growing becoming able overcome stronger stronger challenges repeats difficulty curve minor improvements already limited thingsnow believe game updated get better time cannot recommend current state things like pet riding glider region locked probably removed pointless time wasters fixed progression cube world feels like im fighting friction forced designs dont fit together right experience two versions opinion formed result experiences apologize seems hard understand literarywise brain doesnt information encryption properly ill clarify stuff need betldr developmentwise masterpiece well designed horribly executed progression play time superior result stands right wouldnt recommend game participated alpha ages ago honestly game hasnt really improved much allprogression slow would fine didnt feel like every time went new area starting game permanent progression game items make getting around tiny bit quicker keep consumables materials pets areasits disappointing long wait game isnt fun game fun would recommend alpha player update alpha dont recommend personally ive enjoying experience far even different way different almost feels like new game alpha long ago b standalone game fun perfect bthe region locking stands good use many resources craft full set top tier gear stomp one area soon cross border without realizing get oneshot random mob could fixed interesting unique ways like example rather gear obsolete instantly scale away original region even gear autoswap gear new region even simple popup saying gear obsolete would help unique equipment also region locked makes annoying remember zone looking map going hunting gear artifacts also useful somehow though even issues still fun play region locking makes end using different types weapons tiers like one region boomerang next bow last crossbow sure easily kill tier bosses one area next fun difficult time tier boss varies gameplay makes interesting play even first area cleared b bunch changes need made though bthe region lock harsh would much better systems make gear valuable say like collecting artifacts region made gear fall less would make seemingly useless artifacts much better certain artifacts allow carry unique equipment surrounding number zones rehauling map structure procedurally generate zones would allow region lock removed make zones scale difficulty im game developer dont know would difficult add feel would make game much fun less punishing wanting explore new areastldr game fun really bad mechanics built personally dont ruin game definitely polarizing youre looking game alpha barely game sure classes weapons skills mechanics make feel like sequel something along lines recommend game think looks interesting want cube world years ago long gets updates worth pls people long know youre getting buy game great dont buy expecting infinite item progression unless use mod currently gaining popularity p still plenty single player playtime youll get bored mention multiplayer people already said regionlock essential items ruins entire experience would like start every time would enter new region woul simply create new game makes entire thing worse fact arent dynamic quests every single time need collect item clear dungeons rewardunlock thererfore new regions arent even new adventure much dont want say urge purchase game current state originally part alpha like better sticking old client game everything made game worthwhile essentially gutted turn added numerous region lock restrictions almost every element used make game enjoyable hope game ends molded something worthwhile since already years honestly dont see happening biggest feelsbadman year much really wanted like game waiting years play cant really recommend game current state much id love say game improved drastically since alpha pre release cant fully recommend current state new questing system present game overall huge increase previous one alpha certain new features presented quite quirky game needs much explaining really necessary order play properly enemies first areas extremely difficult lack levelling system currently theres way really power order take challenges playing water mage traversing surrounding area hours trying find single item weapon give edge go new area find weapons armor useless even alpha levelling system personally think world much interesting explore defacto way play game still alpha purely somehow felt finished wholetldr game much fun current state come back later much love cube world alpha please buy game right nowplease wait another month updates see game becomes wasting money like thousands people current state id give alpha depth current game although alpha already tons stuff missing much wanted love game full release canti played alpha way back day well honestly yeah worseits much worse fact modding game mandatory enjoy huge problemi really really wish game still good noti honestly wouldnt surprised wollay intentionally ruined game people would leave alone thats merely thoughtsif considering buying game please take note require mods semblance funand even bitter heart reccomend supporting indy devs good time devs need give fans proper communication wollay extensive history communication months years cannot support project game gets updates better ill happily revisit update review accordingly right worth asking first time playing really enjoyed relaxing easy play little googling controls great modding potential release stay away game lot us bought game early access expect game stay game impossible however design choices made release absolutely fun rewarding game definitely evolved devolved point stood years ago though many hours way game worked completely changedinstead levelling character permanently progression item bregionb based causes struggle players constantly grind restart benefit completing whole region artefact gives player near worthless benefit increased travel speed system implemented prevent players levelling character within week stopping playing game believe harsh toned especially since levelling difficult begin gear obtained pure luck point time almost everything one shots players adventure minutes find enemies killable otherwise stronger enemies lured npcs defeat enemies player slightest chance gear usable classthe old promised skill tree also gone benefit skills unlocked begin game gear centredwollay wife definitely done good jobs though idea gathering new travel options differently levelled enemies new quests dungeons new biomes easily interactive map changes made classes bcube world isnt gone hasnt destroyedb believe best wait bit longer better progression system least change doesnt make reset every hours mean game entirely unenjoyable enjoyed quite hours especially disregard fact region lock thing sense achievement still carry throughout everywhere main issue game game worth buy played game years ago absolutely loved completely agree getting rid exp system quite annoying seeing people cheat time like wolley going game fact said waiting release game perfected bothers put countless hours game things changed least responds community agree community feels like hardly reward spending hours trying find artifacts region locked items hard get used game general hard start found artifacts stats increase percentage goes smaller smaller time suggestions something along lines changes believe game would much launch pads shrines map huge takes long get point point b go new region start pet special ability feel like isnt much point finding new pets serve basically purpose attack sometimes run circles anything ride probably one best parts game climbing completely broken press e climb makes fall time alphas mechanics plus items difficult find work surrounding areas mobs touch unless find better weapon basically useless regions think plus items whole entire different menu crafting gui would give much better reason find resources like emeralds sapphires especially cotton super expensive difficult find finally think instead completely useless items region locked well biome locked items found certain region example jungle biome stats another jungle biome uselessness biomesthe game still fun play within hours days gets tedious boring sure lot people agree get wrong aspects game fantastic wolley needs listen community bit least answer questions many people getting ignored basically feel punished progressing game fun friends even hours becomes tedious hope something changes within next weeks see community dying quickly loves idea feel game huge potential would love see game thrive release cant recommend region issues reviews mention arent major issue major issue progression difficult intraregion enemies reasonably defeat starter gear lot time spent finding appropriatetiered enemies actually fight get good drop often steamroll content region without effort since theres xp progression inside given region entirely luck based get drops weapons classes youve gained nothing allthis spite game lot nice touches lore beauty world generation despite since core gameplay loop isnt satisfying entire game ceases satisfying youre either extremely underpowered given challenge overpowered afterthought little right able recommend people play lot content supposed plus region locking gear artifacts make extremely un fun game play loop especially grand misfortune spawning ocean dont know bug swimming hours end find boat used section ocean ideal way play game missing post sums review hours gamei currently spent hours solo rest friends solo gameplay isnt bad get relatively stale awhile game usually fun friends though awhile also seem get bit stale kinda means game lacking game currently region locking mechanic means gear youve collected throughout gameplay locked current region except regions artifact weapons one seems understand get quite work artifacts really provide miniscule addition one current stats diving stamina glider stamina etc exact however stack manage get lot artifacts combat isnt horrible however great alpha deal damage enemies higher weapon level doesnt really feel good alpha cant really kill bosses much bigger level via skill based good weapon means get really good weapon region practically done still really like game however definitely going game hop friends really bored need find something kill time recommend currently im sure dont love hate game played huge part childhood along side everyone else remember playing much friends making new friends random servers etc youre looking something kill time good hours would buy like said great friends little maybe itll get better future maybe wollay abandon us knows im going part report many bugs issues suggestions try influence games development writing review wollay teased new updatein current state personally couldnt recommend anyonewill update whenif next update comes one alpha players someone keeping eye devs twitter looking forward content teased dont know scrapped thoughin current state game feels like mvp market viable product stuff thats ill change review game gets updated currently thing hurts game artifacts dont mind restarting region holy god artifacts suckglide speed dont even keep glider move another regionlamp radius aside dungeons uses outside go inn sleep daylightdive stamina biomes land based unless specifcally choose water biomewhat want free damage armor health anything make time new region easier survive weapon teirs form stars apply artifacts higher stars stats given man makes worse cant even use crafted gear next region get expensive youre crafting yellows time youre crafting youve probably already finished quests current biome kind pointless one alpha players cube world thrilled see wollay releasing end september said comparing alpha version beta version kind disappointed dont get wrong kind like game see future gets tweaked right way playing first region excitement quickly wears room joy getting good gear get legendary weapon oh well trash next area fact artifacts weak making feel like repeating neverending cycle grinding without reward would say wait future updates buy game preteen first picking game friend would spend hours excited day hop grind dungeons years friend kept tabs game update finally came hopped excited play aspects game removed annoying region locking appeared dont want hate game devs appreciate effort game forever heart dont think continue follow game rip cubeworld bought cube world back pretty much given expecting hear anything im glad developers able finally release block art style still really appealing shame full release hadnt lived potential shown previous alpha version cube world isnt exciting six years hope see developmentbased changes alpha lack communication updates long period cant recommend currently someone bought game played two hours returned game waiting update long time feel game take another many years get community wants playing game great potential lacking dev updates dedication keep game going meet full potential someone play beta find cube world well worth price ive heard murmurings supposed could lot like end day cube world great experience far like style little explanation even meant didnt figure could fast travel move map around late still fun

regionsall wollay great appreciate time effort would certainly say game worth price bit morepsyou pet friendly animals thats solid feature whos good giant alpha dog yooouuuu aaarrreeeee someone didnt play much alpha cant really compare old version game important isnt version gamewith said personally enjoying regionzone locked mechanic game successfully defeating every big baddy first region headed new one essentially youre starting find new gear regionrestricted items yes frustrating find refreshing wants strong carry regions whats point finding artifacts gives stat bonuses carry matter go plus completing regionsexploring big part game part enjoy mosthonestly would recommend game lot fun especially friends someone doesnt see game rosetinted glasses agree negative reviewslevel via artifacts even got didnt level bring back exp system tremendously improved game doesnt quick levels way get stronger along gear progression regionregion locking gear effective region made dont know rest players dont like starting essentially new game every time wanna go somewhere else especially since takes hours somewhat threateningchanging even one improve game play almost infinite amount someone apart ride since say game nothing anticipated starting slow thats bad game like issue comes think start scratch immediately cross another region happened borders reward finishing regions movement speed something else minimal theres point finishing zones start scratch time move quicker exploration feels like ripped game sure fun run around see see thats youre set region whilst youre gearing feel like youre locked inside certain region last thing would want cross border isnt exploration rpg supposed exploring took game completely wrong direction im happy see also word wollay day whilst trying hype twitter disgusting someone account since alpha simply cannot enjoy game current state region locked equipment even mobility gear glider removes fun exploring amazing world someone played alpha actually less enjoyable alpha dont know happened isnt fun boring alpha great progression loop youd grind get better gear youre basically beating game different biome pet health random shit like someone played alpha someone played video games general please buy game fix itimagine world cant level mobs stronger youand theyre lot lurking ready gang bang soon get within range oh boy mage enemy ranged ability get ready get sent back last resurrection statue lets say survive long enough find village get ore make gear stronger nowyes able take mildly stronger monsters long fight one potions youve crafted able heal warriors shoutassuming changed class guardian running around etching quick hits praying dont aggro another enemy realize youre really much stronger go back fighting weaker enemies find god tier weapon oh man everything better one shot everything eh oh well least make progress right right lets explore map find even harder enemies fightnow youre reach edge region awaits endlessly vast game region locked gear region locked gear whats mean huh well gear found upgrades key upgrades gliders boats reigns climbing claws everything gone back hours nothing matters one bit new regionthis game punishes exploring reason fight enemies doesnt get anything money youre lucky good weapon class didnt get lucky enough fighting terriers sheep get class weapon thats overpowered one shot weapon everything going stomp even try get stronger progress removed every time go new region game gives absolutely goals imagine every rpg game youve ever played resetting progress every time go new town thats cube world gotta fix game better changes someone played alpha religiously must say full release game feels unrewarding ways unplayable dev team abandoned community work passion project feeling means unfortunately wont care feedback receiving game punishes exploring taking items away every time enter new region nerfing armor weapons hp damage state reflecting first time loading instead gaining experience leveling exploring regions higher level enemies get reset every time explore takes away desire explore especially movement travel items taken away new regions desire play game progress immediately eliminated want see world spawned problem xp equipment system alpha wish stuck understand wanted try something new unique personal game opinion formula one many people would say worth year waiti cant recommend game current state loved alpha like release feels disappointing could go back alpha still access someone played alpha definite downgrade key features iremovedi final version things tweeted saying working icompleted themi completely absent final version wanted second run cash grab closing websites shop years ago letting us get excited dont waste money someone watched alpha never played really enjoying game understand criticism gets yes grindy guess thats part charm loving legend zelda links awakening style collecting different tools musical instruments help along way excited finally get game let think long go open mind understand game alpha build change drastically enjoy bought game onsale think thats great pricepoint game definitely worth bucks usually retails hold buying id wait till onsale someone whos played since release alpha literally month alpha dropped version game despite major difference still really fun opinion mechanics different normally see openworld rpgs admit starting difficult could get smoked bee soon jump get hang things really enjoyable theres always stuff would love see big updates game game goes alpha beta feels though less content game mechanics refined class skills unique balanced remapped different buttons however lack skill tree ruins lot fun game map fog unexplored places gone desire explore new areas due knowing next region store addition instruments plus find give optional gear loot lose next region lot people would prefer skip alpha players feels lot like slap face already experienced fun exploring world wollay made alpha one big dungeon per region doesnt help alpha players used exploring many harder dungeons stuff like spike traps finding much changed beta release one week later quite disappointing would give game shot id recommend new players preferably friends going exploring region unique pets terrain generation worthwhile experience try returning players youre missing much best wait wollay update game even game right simply cannot recommend dont disagree region locking way executed new cubeworld build clunky best downright irritating others feel small changes could recommend game changes implemented right simply cannot game lot potential please write good change hopefully game right dont buy wait updates lets hope going another one game stands dont recommend people buy buy game reading youll see im talking game stands right recommend game compared several years ago versions game play disgusting much alpha either removed altered mind numbingly boring hard even play game couple hours region spawn fun explore every inch region work way good equipment maybe even catch pet two get region artifact move next region realise things one gear worthless forcing start effectively scratch two artifacts grant character useless bonuses ie swim speed little effect game play three game tells level completing region nothing character stat boosts new skills nothing forth youve completed region youve pretty much done everything game besides unique dungeons rarely spawn mean go see new biomes landscapes really isnt anything else thus giving little reason venture starting region much love cube world much want see full potential game cant recommend anyone right first didnt like play sense starts make fun istips sleep inn refreshes map aka quests mobs drops themtalk every npc items really annoying find tell whereyou look world map really zoomed locate geographical oddities normally questsitemsloreonce complete first zone get artifact gear starts dropping things gain value potions werent using become useful start new zone monsters quests completed zone worth potential gear end cycling daily looking gear explore new zone till sleep repeat enjoy combat item huntingcollecting im better fighting monsters general started even though gear resets new zone slow get faster find gear still hunt perfect piece gear rare enough keep busy find artifacts character gains passive boosts make exploring faster time complete zones youll litter quests choose repeat daily search gear perfect game even game years ago kind refreshing play something feels different though gradually getting fun play first going rail game found coming back want play cute game great feedback base game loops said still major flaws lots minor go things liked gameprosgood gameplay fun move world use abilitiescertain sounds eg drops pickup attack sounds musiccertain biomes eg desert biome jungle biomes beautiful work wellthe basic progression loop relatively satisfyingcombat get skilled play top new gear impossible enemies easynow pretty solid pros game needs fundamental changes im going play already lets start minorminor conswater sounds

legendariesafter conquering one zone become godlike least warrior take legendary mobs come top little effort leads easy gold farming day sleep night rinse repeatthe gem trader gnomes useless remember respawns ore deposits case knew diamond ore spots farmed day diamonds top huge iron ore areas making legendaries becomes jokegear gear get works adjacent zones really broken exist case two legendary items shield chestpiece makes adjacent zones absolute joke gear become useless entering adjacent zone rather decrease stats every number zones youve traveled original isnt preset gear option current zone change mountains gear manually every timethere isnt main story really sink conquer long time rather theres artifact locations uncover add small bonuses semiuseless things like hang gliding speed boat speed etc arent useless hey lets real feel useless especially teleport shrine near town well fly needs big main randomly generated enemy certain continents point game could conquer every randomly generated zone randomly generated continent beat randomly generated big daddy boss fight randomly generated mechanics right everything feels useless like nothing say randomly generated enough concludes thoughts feelings cube world thanks reading first quite difficult game really enjoyed get hang basically finished game isnt much get hours game play depending fast learnhow much die really isnt end game cant really show youve achievedfound also played alpha thus got beta free beta quite different alpha good way theres bugs game runs well finished product worth current state first game seemed extremely fun creative buying starting play also seems fun completing everything one biome area decide move next basically start gear previous area gained worthless doesnt work new area time go new area begin anew simply fun anymore reccomend buy unless theres sinificant update definetly worth price experience also glitchy doesnt feel like complete game core fun pick put game play much youll get burnt quickly likely wont enjoy least move tiny investment made years ago judge game today like adult fun game pass time alone friends least hype fun weekgood luck next time wollay least gave free us bought hype alpha thats say game developers nowadays props unfortunately game fails even worse live hype lots potential fun yet barebones gameplay scrapped new arguably worse system progression difficulty starting area hard easy everywhere else game enemies seem random spawned levels rather alphas method easy enemies spawn progressively difficult progress outward never really truly progress either alpha looting find good items grinding powerful could weird system region locked items never get true sense progression core gameplay still enjoyable however seriously crippled flaws outlined im gonna say buy developer likely come back game shame current stage grind way way much recommend current state game cant recommend game one big reason progression system played game week alpha players got game one week early dont think havent given game fair gothe game changed significantly alpha many reviews tell removal exp itembased progression region locked gear removal skill trees gear etc changes overall feel game different shock many alpha players game changed one massive grind many different smaller grinds region zone map feeling like new game plus similar prestige system seen many clicker games reset gain slightly power next completion concept resetbased progression system need find artefacts permanent upgrades actually good encourages player explore regions fully interact villages find artefacts however artefacts arent goodthe artefacts moment provide small noncombat buffs example riding speed increase light radius provided lamp isnt enough encouragement continue playing players perspective never truly feel like getting stronger core aspect rpg instead feeling like every time completed region worth slightly stronger feels like enter new region made new character losing progress effort put small noncombat buffs dont feel like worth artefacts need changed include combat buffs damage crit attack speed hp etc dont big buffs least feels worth effort put completing entire region understand break balance late game variety added noncombat buffs kept take long time reach point region takes around hours depending size easily achievable believe significantly help improve progression system keeping many players engaged strive become stronger addition still retain feeling game wollay wants well cant wont hope modding community games current state grind isnt rewarding enough many othersconclusionif looking full release alpha content disappointed matter whatif openminded alpha cube world changing still cant recommend iti cant recommend game anyone looking short game maybe hours play friends progression system doesnt feel rewarding enough completing one two regions without friends feels like theres nothing left game could go explore regions get artefacts purpose artefact slightly slows fast stamina runs water maybe want explore cool world design wollay modding community fix wont playing gameside notes point killing enemies arent travellers people objective rarely drop gear way improve power almost ignored therefore much interesting enemy design wasted enemy ai broken times experience enemies sometimes run around player standing completely still never attacking however isnt frequent doesnt affect game much crafting become obsolete time character point craft legendary gear basically already legendary gear similarly crafting expensive isnt really worth especially goes towards one region many promised improvements never implemented housing variation quests shown cube world quests preview classes races mmo serves etc guilds lore behind pretty barebones size mobile game development nearly decade sadly game isnt enough im traditionally major fan open world survival games strong difference breath wild forest cube world every open world game ive played content packed every corner cube world arid open world game synonymous least head rich content prioritize nonlinear story telling progression cube world breaks norm focuses traveling next objective instead getting mission running npcs way objective game chucks randomly generated hostile enemies either makes run away spend ten minutes fighting combat system one directional well lacks variety whatsoever wants use special ability run away wait recharge game would cool format nostalgia waited years full release new player like im playing roblox start quite difficult really enjoy game quite fun play grind learning game pretty neat time writing spent hours playing cube world enjoyed every second itcoming game first time wonderful new things discover around every corner every new bit gear exciting found large noticeable jumps power provided gear based progression much gratifying xp based systemthere much interact world actions feel like purpose getting new gear freeing trapped gnome camp ogres tells much interesting story might found alpha gameie commit crab genocide level upalthough overarching artifact progression system might benefit little bit oomph find core gameplay loop variance regions enough keep hooked game region far played differently due region looked gear sometimes youll fight tooth nail level weapon scrape together enough money buy better gear sometimes youll get lucky op weapon drop first boss steamroll region like godoverall would heavily recommend game big thank wollay pixxie making moment time give cube world long way go potential listen community feedback hopefully dont wait another years version optimistic development game quicker last time around youre unsure game like many wait updates cubeworld become full game point time core gameplay loop cube world makes game dry monotonous hours gameplay lack gripping emotional attachment game via story otherwise overarching content truly keeps engaged goal one given region factor consider purchaseeach region essentially areas explore difference biomes one region might circle power one might mausoleums something theres nothing work towards aside

regionlocking gets way exploring enjoyment moving another region one things enjoyed alpha finding big mountain jumping hang gliding across map something find often cant anymore unless managed find regions hang glider usually somewhat easy get way overall enjoymentone major flaw lack information explanation game mostly doesnt tell anything enemy difficulty colours classes class skills regionlocking etc hard enough returning players like see big problem new playerssummaryoverall really enjoy game needs bit time oven would like heartily recommend game cant go far current state merely

region mini adventure end goal region get regions artifacts increase level give small stat buff noncombat related stat point move new region basically sent back square one makes feel like youre really progressing much really starting scratch changes would like see travelling gear like boats hang gliders climbing gear universal artifact stat increases substantial also core stats like health attack power etc changes would help player feel like actually progressing complete region even though essentially losing armor reverting back default state moving new areaoverall im lot fun game would like see changes made progression system basically game good got released steam leveling zonelock trash could great game got abandoned time would recommend veloren instead want try game like get cubeworld modded beautiful rpg enjoyed player coopas veteran love update diversity lookonly downside imo gets kinda repetitive game doesnt beautiful game great potential current state quickly becomes boring progress gear etc made character disappears move regions gear drop rates dont work wellthere levels dont get gaining experience points get collecting certain items level youre rewarded small boosts inane things like climbing speed skills character beginning cannot level increase damage stronger geargear drop rates dont work well get strong equipment quickly played beta friend almost full legendary gear hours playing words practically gotten strong possible current region feel resistance enemies would move new region start less zerostarting new character frustrating easy die beginning youve found first green gear pieces started snowballing sometimes spawn temple almost minutes away place died nightmare especially nighttime many different monsters almost murder character see far dark cannoti hope wollay trashes current progression system brings back something like one used cube world alpha wasnt perfect fairly classic rpg system experience points gained killing monsters could spent gaining strengthening different skills skill tree never left feeling emptiness even monster killed didnt drop items slowly gained stronger stronger gear wouldnt disappear moving regions could freely explore different regions without game smacking head removing progressin short cube world get kicked around enemies find better gear quickly snowball power point youll decide whether want run around hours steamrolling rest region level get practically worthless reward b enter new region get kicked around enemies find better gear continuing cycle pain could become voxel equivalent classics like terraria diablo currently manages inferior alpha despite years development beautiful game feels nice play almost tech demo anything real content beyond hour mark complete region repeats process struggling get good item snowballing moving around region snails pace levelling skill upgrades changes even combat thought would saving grace game gets boring tedious end hold shift clean aisle npcs bland repetitive dialogue dungeons ive seen far glitchy graveyard demon portals cauldrons surrounded mobs modding supported could good go revitalizing game doesnt seem like theres going incentive support steam workshop despite knowing dubious nature game beforehand bought game anyways hoping people cry babies game finished hope main devs dont run money thousands others shoveled actually use improve unfinished game possibly creating team money moment feels like situation timber stone stonehearth pretty game lot potential left abandonedat moment shouldnt buy game give months year come back check updates beautiful game got originally alpha love bit difficult play single player like challenge multiplayer much easier much like dd highly recommended especially enjoy games like dd minecraft legend zelda killing monsters doesnt increase counter people crying game worthless youre interested exploring regions nice sceneries steamrolling every single thing game forever farming gear hours game lot fun level progression done away means gear thing left also means gear everything gear let alone good gear rarely dropsits impossible kill anything isnt baby level without cheesing game unless really good gearbecause consistent progression except gear gear cannot used beyond one area need start overof course could find super duper rare gear star lets go next area keep stats thats even rarer good gear first placethere point playing game payoff point anything everything meaningless got good gear nope next area got bad gear tough everything within miles oneshot health powerful combo good luck grinding get chance loot playing since wonderful indie game following game since alpha release hope see improvement updates impressive considering made husband wife since original release update cycle management history game insulting anyone purchased end day feels like developer shielding around pity producing excuses whilst okay reaching pocket without providing reasonable presence communication development progress development speed content quality quantity gamei recommend product since like years ago happy see game updated big fan new things though like items bound certain areas playing since wouldnt recommend game resets progress explore map leading thing maybe another years update playing since years ago say worth wait new zone mechanic nice dont start new characters time new soundtrack really good simple solid game waiting years game cant say im disappointed hope gets future updates fixes leveling system went garbage new update however see much potential future cubeworld would recommend anyone likes rpgs willing give game time improvement waiting game look fun issues think fixed waiting game six years since purchased alpha really good game pretty fun explore

backwards cant recommend game current state fun alpha significantly better almost every way massive changes need made make fun bring back xp killing mobs take away region lock better purpose explore bought alpha awesome infinite rpg came back years latter expecting better game instead got completely different game basically horribly designed adventure roguelike fun got equivalent bait switched bought alpha many years ago got free steam key sucks bring back alpha please thanks bought game years ago still waiting good update bought game back friends showed shortly dev went completely radio silent none updates showed working ever got added six years later got excited see game getting real release steam found old account information could use old key play final game hour uninstalled changes ruined experience regardless think game good current state cant deny pretty fckd devs make game promised bought game back alpha days waited years released happy new updates beta game based region locked weapons armour become useless move another region unique takes fun away first fun quickly got bored bought game back alpha launchedthe game great lacked things overall great exploration amazing never felt bound place got see monuments leveling getting new skills new equipment ofcourse good lootfrom could tell back game felt heading weird cross legend zelda dungeon running looting experience diabloworld warcrafthonestly point game felt needed quests varied loot cool special effects builds could wildly varied items ofcourse skill tree yet finished reason normal attack actually damage weird right sarcasmnow finally got quests items lets go special areas however came great costyour character longer becomes powerful leveling slightly small stats like speed different vehiclesyou dont get keep loot get travelling new zone even boats hang gliders means want explore ocean travel island swimming pray gods believe boat area first island visit randomly generated terrain quests meaning odds find first find last funinstead amazing freeform exploration player could carve adventure without friends youre forced stay one region youve completed finally youre burnt one zone youre supposed move next collect items thing different placenot starting seems incredibly unfair atleast back could kill trash mobs easily farm xp start would kind questing system help get xp make levelling process bit fun plus since xp removed drop rates items normal mobs low enemies way dont get rewarded interacting unless quest even didnt really matter since youll leave area anywayalso since basic attacks miss combat feel floaty disjointed get items point combat become kind fun doesnt matter since soon want new backdrop youre back square one tldr game potential become one best procedurally generated looters instead came something completely else core gameplay mechanics seem halfway thought throughi see idea behind region lock ends disheartening wanted new character wouldve made one myselfnow imagine old cube world could find lot random quests killing mob youd find quest gave one magical items like harp could use world find loot making exploration easier like bought hang glider boat shops back daysorry wollay excited seems like radical change core gameplay done oven even im sure would ever entirely cookhope youll add old progression back kind different mode since honestly went back played alpha much rewarding punished wanting see desert bought game back echo feelings negative reviewsi played beta hours see clearing several zones timethe alpha experience far better nostalgia still dl original cubeworld accountits much better almost everyway main beta benefit flight master imorip cubeworld bought game alpha im happy finally released years cubeworld isnt quite alpha believe pros cons big difference current version based artifact region progression gear rather exp ive enjoying change progression starts feel linear get new regions artifacts provide passive buffs gear becomes worthless find gear works neighbouring regions feel like improved future artifacts useful buffing health stats like crit attack regeneration ectexploration alot fun get used new progression system map isnt procedurally generated actually one map almost infinite still get unique experience everyone else map zoom close see points interest add waypoints onto later region different chests hidden everywhere arenas unique bosses things affecting like petrified towns npc possession mana pumpsone big cons tutorial telling class skills starting gear except weapons start hard new old players first thing recommend mark town buy available gear activate wayshrines discover reduce travel time well theyre usually evenly spaced collect resources discover crafting gear potions inventory unlimited space limited stack item feel like lack tutorial needs fixed future starting region tutorial area somethingin end feel like could recommend game feel like got moneys worth still lots pros cons game feel like potential dev said lots ideas future cubeworld look forward comes next bought game alpha got enough hours fun salty make review short recommend game spend lot time walking engage boring combat relatively simple enemies little terms progression vertical horizontal even little basic action game prettyish landscapes pretty empty overall bought game early childhood

cant recommend game current state cash grab patch since launch communication week launch probably stayed week give new players hope updated fun around biomes around hours realize shit casual positive review counter whining people complain change alpha betait good change one unique gameplays ever fun maybe hard get perfect means worth reviewing negatively especially considering people made game current elements get fleshed combat exploration lore finding artifacts making potions weapon customization spirit cubes game potential become time classic cannot stress enough doesnt need new elements especially change progression system need exp bar alright legit flesh mentioned elements perfect game nonetheless already really fun play current variety artifacts keyitems makes worth least explore

complete radio silence developer since release game steam super promising game beloved features seemingly gutted reason whatsoever completely different alpha strayed away better different still good game though honestly really like completely different pitched randomly generated exploration rpg turned roguelite completly different game alpha even less content dont trust developer considering story behind game developers give good review compared alpha years ago cube world change lot still offers great exploration experience time comes twist rpg type games devs trying something new unique progression system wont please everyone though since dev seems quick fix bugsissues im sure cube world massive potential become something even greater need give time considering need mod make game even enjoyable id say one buy really want buy though wait sale give scammers published little money possible go get one alpha builds still floating around internet youll fun version one contender best walking simulator yearif sideways thumb recommendation game would get great game many flaws please region lock dear god contrary lot reviews page dont mind progression system game liked game devs completely disappeared ignored community players moderators since release cant recommend hope well isnt due extraneous circumstance support email still operational like isnt someone background operating things waited year writing make sure hasnt even tweet couple words entire time cool game better played friends core systems game make game unfun game rpg exploration game open world lacks definition region lock punishing leave zone gear becomes useless unless farmed ultra rare versions hours leveling system everything balanced around rng drops walking swimming simulator items designed

ocean zone boat disappears cross border forcing swim closest town even reach town chance told boat unlock zone even get told enjoy minutes swimming said boat locations town even tells isthis game looks like dev ignores feedback im hyperbolic never took feedback game also ignored original road map game abandon systems everyone likedthe dev selfish opinion matters doesnt want hear opinionsthe mods forums include many white knights fanbois arent bad many aretldrthe game sucks dev took years didnt said hed expect abandon game shortly release doesnt want feedback say great shut could great

collect pets anything else irrelevant even items useless get different biomdo buy wait big changes updates could good like alpha gave reason explore explore skills go away bounds still good updates

shouldnt expected constantly work happy take peoples money cube world alpha funchallenging skillbased adventure rpgcube world release stale unplayable unless u get lucky rngbased stay one place unless want start lacks rpg elements skilltrees progression refunddont buy game think gonna bring back memories years ago almost unrecognizable cube world alpha better cube world beta unfortunately quite disappointing cube world alpha generic rpg simple graphics simple game design obvious objective explore get stronger however despite simplicity game quite delightful graphics controls simple refreshing compared big time rpg games guild wars diablo massive story plot key skillsabilities full flare colors feel like charm cube world actually straightforward game wasin beta depth added gameplay parts enjoyable like reason talking npcs explore world new mission system increased difficulty game end picromas efforts trying counter flaws founded alpha ended slacking improving charm game straightforwardness instead replace theres feeling pointlessness point exploring achieving strong item leads nothing stats said item disappears upon entering new biome point striving levels leveling merely improves incredibly useless stats one biome essentially next theres joy forced replay thing overi feel however gameplay may greatly improve overall leveling simply significant meaning cube world beta disappointed review long time fanive following cube world since beginning ive purchased game soon released continued playing time time today things made stick game endless beautiful world fun gameplay coop capability spent hundreds hours exploring levelling characters collecting every pet game game early alpha stage mind beta release countless people patiently waiting years booted game played game hours closed game dont drive go back right put front think game still lot things liked alpha multiplayer beautiful endless world example still main problem gameplay precisely new progression system alpha used relatively standard rpg progression system based gathering xp level skills allow wear better gear found system worked pretty well motivated explore fight enemies smaller bigger moments satisfaction kept progressing fitting endless nature gameall gone beta contrary alpha solely uses gear based progression system game means increase characters power collecting new better gear doesnt sound bad right away devil detail gets worse discoverfirst gear collect region bound meaning becomes pretty much useless outside region picked forcing collect new gear every time enter new region feature alone removes feeling long time progression game every time collect shiny new piece armor new weapon remember going useless try travel progress next region inevitably going happen minutes write alpha since youd keep finding stronger gear enemies think certainly could continue picking new gear go werent forced least soon even stuck gear couple hours could still deal enemies little bit effort beta hand absolutely forced collect new gear since loses worth soon go new region gear find completing region doesnt help much either since works adjacent regionssecondly glider boat also tied system means youll search new glider boat every minutes heavily limits freedom exploration makes whole thing lot annoying needs thirdly since enemies strengths present regions gain strongest gear game first couple minutes gameplay happened right away stumbled upon boss mob region managed kill help npcs collected yellow weapon enabled instantly kill enemy region removing challenge sense progression experiencefourthly since skills unlocked right away gameplay experience going stay throughout playtime summarize points think new progression system huge downgrade previous one removes feel real progression makes general gameplay less interesting also negatively influences exploration big go game like cube worldanother thing im disappointed formerly planned features game still lacking features like building bases skills classes pet evolution mmo servers still got promised features like new biomes procedural quests feel like span six years shouldve achieved even people developing game even worked sideas much id like recommend game simply cant state especially people new game isnt build playi hope wolllay pixxie take community feedback incorporate game turn game deserves many things right theres still much potential explored please take communities valid criticism ignore mindless hate toxicity going emerge please continue work game people stuck long

syncing way even two people fights dont get much rewarding made even frustrating fact cant grind get power towns dungeons longer marked map took us hour find town could play together time find second town identify leftovers hopes could equip gear things marked map like boss mobs find didnt find enough gear increase star rating able actually fight much got bored stopped playingtldr short wouldnt recommend steam version fun game youre looking exploration game voxel setting may fortunately still download alpha version website hope play patcher upgrades better version game lost history cube world could much morei absolutely love fact wollay tried something new didnt stick classic cut paste rpg formula level use skill tree gradually gain skills way bad way go rpg many games use formula repeatedly added substance see wollay wanted get away go gear based progression something thats explored lately games like destinyexcept wollays version sucksso spawn cube world huge region explore find loot hard start get hang things progressing various missions available region eventually congrats youre covered legendary gear missions region donethen move next region realize progress carry across borders fuck artifacts supposed permanently buff character cannot carried regions well top permanent progression literally willingly go back step one decided go new regionwollay know know isnt state game like mention various flaws features teased straight scrapped reason spent six years know passion game make good far havent done much prove game isnt know wish could recommend game state worth iti stuck game six years forgave wollay time every time made excuse want refund cube world buy bag chips turns bag mostly air already went bad three weeks ago game better alpha six years ago endless nowadays sets already set world nothing stuck area fear losing progress items went past bordermy main three complaints game gameplay original drained purgatory borders remove progress cross dont know anybody else problem majority attacks used never hit enemy attack straight went enemy didnt anythingi definitely fun game without doubt back alpha current state id say worth money change remove borders andor bring back original style game actually put work building character instead giving perks moves immediatelyalthough best things ive seen cube world much better graphics art compared alpha stable fps matter much stuff rendered cube world great foundation core systems make amazing gameplay experience get better time progression issues none impossible developer navigate throughdefinition constructive criticism constructive criticism process offering valid wellreasoned opinions work others usually involving positive negative comments friendly manner rather oppositional oneif look negative comments dont deserve called feedback reviews arent definition criticism constructive criticism reasoning based logical thought negative comments stem entitled behavior immediate emotional decision making cube world barely evolved years fact feels like regressed mostlyxp removed favor map completion gear based game understand change maybe get behind however everything else executed poorly wish stayed samethe game wants exploration decides region lock gear even important utility items like hand glider essentially ruining progression turning game unfun roguelike world huge yet rather empty grow hate time must spend going b back spawnpoint glider feels nerfed since alpha requiring stamina needed spend time travelling gamedifficulty curve start laughably broken feels like way progress cheese encounters coop win numbers found corpse running often dark souls balance took nose diveit also doesnt help gear drops seem rng could come source often though gear drops class arent playing crafting huge grind akin hardcore mmosthe form progression artifacts dont make much sense mostly pointless example would find bell used would phase spirit realm ask even spirit realm wouldnt able tell need good description probably buff moment game feels like hugely unrewarding grind unsatisfying disappointing hope hytale right fans genre cube world changed still like something different youll get used still enjoyable switch characters different areas weapons dont matter anymore thats plus however stuff works next area would nice cube world regressed almost every conceivable fashion since release alpha six years ago meaningful progression everything collect becomes useless leave region found incentive fight enemies exp reason explore actually punished gear taken away could play one region hours walking location location looking scenery inferior alpha version using minimap inferior alpha version virtue covered fog already see entire world looking map surprises youre done walking get sometimes go dungeon honestly better designed dungeons alpha good luck getting entire skill system gutted enemies two settings game invincible terminator complete pushover happen find legendary weapon isnt rare sounds youve game leave region course causes everything taken away end day show hard work extra meters lantern radius faster boating speed slower stamina consumption climbing game current state frankly jokei bought played alpha release game dozens hours wasnt feature complete showed promise core gameplay loop fun actual meaningful progression exploration instead spending past six years improving upon base delivering truly fantastic experience developers coldly ripped anything could seen fun engaging game world would recommend less one cube world current state might people expected different doesnt mean badi like doesnt teach things find everything like games old beat feel like real badassright world feels little bit empty theres lot gameplay missing however potential little bit love game become great cube world rpeg role playing exploration game sounds interesting read overall get game like idea exploring around fighting hard bosses minor focus getting temporary loot dont get right looking game level like traditional rpgscube world fun problems blast playing alive alpha atmosphere amazing game play fluid exciting game genuinely fun explore however probably aware progression system centered around region locking itemsthis terrible zone hours content however needs improvements progression system make rewardingdo recommend cube world depends need changes yes going buy game need know game finished like exploring feeling conquering zone zone idea gear downgrading drastically enter new region bother sure recommend game bother still powerful enough beat basic enemies harder ones become challenge like able refight hard boss fight instead getting easier easier like rpgsthe game currently rewards players exploring thats level based rewards opinion amazing thereother reviews talk promised wollay communicate true bear mind unfinished gamethank enamean cube world beautiful depth game give chancethis isnt average rpg game nobody telling go thats makes game greatjust like rpgsmmos dont beat game day play grow experience world comes exploring world knew nothing back alpha years ago beyond fun im excited time content cube world fantastic game concept design bit flawed take moment enjoy true potential shines party element early adopter ive lot time game beautiful aesthetic wonderful charms whimsy take quite ride region region dont truly realize much stuff packed one region actually explore carefully easy miss ton stuffhowever writing game flaws theyre ironed gameplay isnt balanced writing design elements arent perfectly flowing ways isnt say game future game presently writing worth assuming continues get ever frequent doting amounts love bugfixes getting course last weekthe game problems developer historically speaking done much project since inception years ago thats lot time games quite like cube world theres lot budding potential hope game really blossom burned many perhaps game may redeem self future ill likely change review detail worsens gets better substantial way cube world fantastic game expresses creativity possibilities exploration rpgs various features quirks game seen far shaky start beginning minor annoyances would say excellent game perfect choice players enjoy games like breath wild etc would recommend yes would change things probably hotel trivago cube world fantastic game absolutely loving far played since alpha still love game especially changes madewollay pixxie made great gameignore negative reviewsall reviews want game isnot one negative review anything constructive sayi would defs recommend game cube world fantastic game dont get wrong ive alpha player since early days technically got free paid waaay back sooo got hyped lots lots times even though put back expectations around release realising probably would heavily disappointed hyped muchsadly game couldnt keep even lower expectations lot lovely mechanics changed already right place needed ploshing upgrades elements got either completely removed still lack general execution lets stay positive first let tell great work executed considering mostly made single person couple got harassed development also organise manage whole life behind covers cube world fantastic idea great execution way feels play smooth controlled absolutely stunning way defined whole new desire type game even back earlier game plays without hazzle even though makes machine run hot holding promises far description goes delivers mostly anything needs said definetlydoes mean promises good game perfect meansthis way sadly already swing negative feedback feel bad saying version feels like major step backwards weirdly beta alpha already dont know vision removing expsystem upgrade lower weapons higher levels currency optained quests seems well thought especially almost gear get either region locked locked behind another class fighting enemies servers almost purpose quest hunting getting equipment since enemies give amount gold anyway even pushes kill themi struggle see purpose playing game player receives info whatsoever goes explores sounds refreshing relaxing theory alpha showed already grind stacking quests motivate players long enough even come back game longer time exploration even heavily cut regions way deadly completed last one resulting frustrating experience one makes fun play bit relaxing exploring aspecton top fighting burden progression progression made feels unrewarding hear one see fighting give artefacts equipment money real deal fight die lure enemy city spawn point get op gear kill everything go next region almost everything resets power levels point creating black white power scale either get oneshot oneshot enemies fighting used way become stronger felt natural every aspect especially combined skill tree sort even encounter well balanced enemies artefacts get underwhelmingly unsatisfying useless get permanent boat speed find boat first every new region even find new cross invisible border better said flying f even kicked boat hangglider mount cross specific pixels screen damning die suddenly fall sky drown ocean getting bonus something use permanently something new wished never knew existed gamebefore jump back conclusion something short emptiness graphics yes heard right feel like game empty course cube world cubes distinct style feel cant feel different see blank spaces paths fields also water without wishing love detail ground youre walking beautiful feel like something belongs interaction bombs example gone cold lifeless often gives curves ambience ambience also missing sense sound player enemies make real noises bird tweeting distant humming close hornet nests add lot stunning part negatively oceans look back alpha oceans different landmasses interesting undersea hills oceans almost flat lifeless fishes enemies deep oceans contain small islands half open dungeons raid ease laziness goes lot graphical things like opening windows doors getting dynamic characters know know thats style might spoiled lot minecraft games feels stiff wrong doors open character even kind idle animation small things would make feel much welcome yet sadly thinga design really grinded gears bad way also caused region forced gear worst example actually give get last artefact region dungeon crossed different regions gear get suddenly weaker crossed invisible line one tunnels enemies could also tricked luring part stronger thus exploiting whole dungeon see going ways either suddenly hard easy thanks exploit really hope better idea coming region lock fix border crossing dungeons also encountered several enemies couldnt die dont mean missions unkillable helpers also deal dmg serve dummies mean boss dug ground become untargable heal every undead warrior healed dmg dealt one hit back hp dealing full blown combo star gearwell oh well rant whole negativity still really love game personally continue playing time looking forward prove wrong harsh judgement hope updates come faster since people playing mods workshop especially patches correct things right directionis game worth price maybe certainly everyone anyone interested give shot time future sale hopefully years see happend goes river rightfully blame everything everyone becomes better updates hope experience fate mans skyps twitter teased content like big cities seem implemented cube world fun cute openworld actionrpg needs approached differently normal get best theres real leveling system play instead stats enhanced gear rare drops tied region found region series quests found chatting wandering adventurers chasing gets items open area hang glider soar air boat dont swim everywhere etc frequently rewards better items monsters dont large aggro area easy avoid pull something thats tough either run away find helpful band wanderers take little strategy area becomes new challenge requiring full exploration search gear well rare crafting materials time start zero beginning game theres question epic weapons armor served well previous area gone crossing border new section map youve still got knowledge handle encounters plus crafting materials necessary get started conquering new land meant give player something constantly quest know youre getting approach realization skyrim cube world works fine cube world fun game thing would change make better one region lock gear wish setting get though makes dont get overpowered piece equipment dont need anything else thing quests might due exploring lot areas quests seem lack diversity overall would recommend game play group friends game shines best cube world game exploring key start game might bit hard start low level gear wont able defeat enemies get hang game feel quite rewarding sandbox game doesnt seem much end goal set goals like clearing areas gaining artifacts artifacts items affect every area go unlike normal items region locked mainly raise values affect travel speed certain percentage first might feel somewhat underwhelming gain faster easier explorei think game great feel like lot people havent given enough try cube world game came way back promise regular updates developer drew comparison minecraft several games purchased game way back days launch game received single bug fix update fixed bugs silence never regretted purchase alpha fun combat system went around exploring landscape fighting enemies gaining xp leveling gain skills stats finding powerful armour weaponsrecently game come steam promising essentially cube world developer said full time job engine completely rewritten feel fact bugs exist game existed alpha build came years ago game uses new progression system like world divided zones gear loses stats exit zone found utility items crafting manuals hang glider boat tied area found personally like system thats matter opinion word generation also lot boring specifically oceans ocean biomes consist several small islands supper annoying get lose boat soon enter ocean biome furthermore skill trees removed start skills way improve dont like definitively bad system game also limits world per character instead alphas terraria like system characters freely move worlds dont know removed ability dedicated servers also removed reasoninstead gaining xp leveling killing things level finding stat boosting artifacts would make okay except stats boost useless adding small percentage lanterns radius artifacts gave good buffs combat skills losing gear going next zone would bug deal would still feel like progressing right feels like creating new character starting step game amazing music needs feel like songs overall game could great developer listened community feedback communicated us added added developer terrible communication silence since game released steam twitter updates per year alpha release steam release addition many things alphas todo list make version explanation game feels like potential developer would listen community put smaller much frequent updates explain reasons odd changes change things based feedback similar games like minecraft snapshots cube world game surely divide choices experiences cube world fun really enjoyable experience charming solid gameplay spark love exploration adventure voxel game stay aware game really repetitive biomes discutable design hope like see nothing volcano biome lack variety items generation quest still game large cast monsters lot became pets even mounts music okay best generic worst items regionlocked means get region obtained reset controversial choice bother accept challengein summary cube world game sure potential great adventure specially coop tends hit miss title newcomers still solid game relax boot want feel adventurous little session gamingjust give try cube world good game almost concept current buggy playable bugs encountered playing game werent gameplay bugs technical bugs lot issues fullscreen cursor set perfect resolution cursor would locked certain section screen even happened correct resolution times game would also sometimes open wouldnt display matter many times alttabbed clicked icon taskbar open task manager many times short time game fix bugs ill definitely buy cube world good game however full potential wollay sharing bits pieces systems features years cube world however release game fairly barei find gameplay fairly directionless apart one option going towards zone objective right anticipate wollay add features eventually world needs systems content available even alpha im uncertain wollay took path changing base game everybody loved something untested audience betai would recommend cube world current state cube world good game everyones stuck development history review bombing final product different alpha version thats available yearsthe value proposition game someone easily spend hours single character classes class specializations fantastic well

artifacts center new leveling system give stats relevant combat making players reliant almost equipment found beginning nearly naked makes getting equipment power difficult even enemies tier weapon rating demolish quickly without xp system guarantee steady progress mercy rng drops however begin gather items noticeably higher drop rate high quality gear alpha even laying around random places explore meaning essentially jump straight brutal struggle steamrolling everything path would werent fact net incentive kill anything longer without xp motivator becomes lot easier justify simply avoiding groups enemies travels since unlikely theyll drop anything useful anyway especially get fully geared upwhile collecting magic items movement items scattered across land randomly doesnt take long collect feels easy opinion still fun buying shops though realize crossing border whatever land found renders useless biggest gripe players point included fact sense progression alpha nonexistent beta currently stated frustrating grind point effectively fight things almost easy get powerful enough kill anything path expected clear area go next start scratch power cut back rather scaling enemies match feels dirty collecting items time change lands gets extremely repetitive fast entire map revealed start convenient also makes exploration dull excitement alpha approaching land border anticipating next biome might gone easy instead chart path blitz unique biome exhausting unique scenery unnaturally quicklywhen initially purchased cube world back things mystified excited prospects gear customization skill treesi never seen voxel game could build weapons adding cubits piece piece elemental spirit cubes neat full potential hoped see instead removed would matter much anyway weapons become useless crossing borders traveling kingdoms case items skill trees though rudimentary absolutely bolstered gameplay added feeling distinct progression level customization weapon type functioning differently showed potential tooi hoped see skills expanded upon given actual branches planned original roadmap options customization variety involving different weapon functionalities instead scrapped even core gaining xp leveling access new gear prevent putting super powerful gear steamrolling everything early gave sense progression distinct goal cutting left game feeling open ended little motivation seek artifacts effects lackluster devoid variety legendary gear easily accessible scaled player level even without regionlock speed progression seems far quick features excited roadmap unimplemented well pet evolution prospect additional classesat end day game isnt unplayable lot ways pretty fun would say even veteran players displeased majority changes coulddespite game may hoped forprobably enjoy experiencing new content couple hours changes made core gameplay made subvert power creep directly conflict spirit exploration new update boasts lead adventure gets stale

dont buy game needs major updates modding needs take unsatisfying mechanics balance issues cube world good game love things could changed think xp bar needs came back instead getting xp per kill could buffed like xp per kill zones need changed loosing stats go different zone really sucks feels like grinding good gear put wast could make zones harder zones zone gear could scaled gear zone got still

world explorationfocused roguelike action rpg progression cube world based gear valid region obtained case items appended name adjacent regions permanent progression cube world based special artifacts find end small adventures region writing artifacts serve minor quality life buffs ultimately minor buffs bestowed artifacts major problem game regionlocked gear makes progression exploration rewarding across regions think artifacts actually make difference characters power feel meaningful rather arbitrary overall think excellent game play solo friends extremely good value price cube world great game gets repetitive quickly region locked gear problem finding special items hang glider spirit bell divine harp ect gets bit annoying find artifact must get lore difficult leave wondering around bit overall game fun experience even fun friends cube world lot like girl dated back thenat first sunshine rainbows shed hold hand every hour spent felt like minutes passedafter started seem little kept promising stuff knew id enjoy want months shed say forgotten make discovered intention ever fulfilling single promise made keeping around money cube world nice chill game play grindy fun cube world means perfect easy dont know going die lot get basics still die due either bad decisions even possible lag game rather cpu intensive timesi hope game continues updated blast play explore feels like missing something like classes weapon item variants abilities much great way spend time hours pretty good pcand yes many reviews talk alpha personally never got copy know feel version quite different direction heading back alpha levels skill trees many things made world personal time played sadly however thats past devs whether get see interesting features future really hope looked amazing anyone elseso give cube world fun issues many things people looking forward missing cube world seems passion project developed creators mind since child taking inspiration various iconic games notably zelda cube world throws extremely large open world lots great featuresthe great combat fun interesting times challenging concept simply running wilderness finding adventures well implemented animations sounds art direction come together extremely satisfying experience software runs freaking well ways havent seen game flying one side map everything loads instantly smoothly start running around straight away pausing objects load moving around fighting player npc animations smooth fast well feels really really nicethe bad cannot get multiplayer connect seconds classes quite unbalanced moment make sure play water mage playing solo enough unique content keep interested beating multiple zones im sure issues change near future none make second guess purchasing game great one play cube world used game held close played nearly daily years back changes made past year feels like complete promised us dont get wrong game concept great optimization alright voxelgraphics nice isnt cube world promised anymoreif wollay really loves appreciates community followed throughout listening complaints fixing things accordingly even reverting systems wouldnt problemi change review something positive happens point think unlikely update looks like wollay took money ran game abandoned cube world advertised procedurally generated endless exploration rpg inspired legend zelda diablo world warcraftthe alpha beta delivered different waysthe core differences sticking point lot people alpha brought infinite progression leveling system killed things pretty much way gain xp leveled gained skill points could either put towards combat abilities exploration abilities first unlocking improving could also improve combat gear power requirementstats consisted mostly traditional rpg stats different names tempo instead hasteattack speed pretty standard stuff power overall summation characters performance creating character would create world via seed dropped first zone would based level surrounding zones radiating would generally increase level range difficulty progressed level cap new regions enemies progressed along thus game could theoretically continue endlessly pretty much occasionally would encounter dungeons region usually castle pyramid sort also overworld bosses basically larger regular enemies damage sponges could easily beat boss minutes quests consisted random npcs pointing dungeon overworld boss thats itthe full release thematically goes things different way also providing lot structure previously moving new zone encouraged begin killing looking loot gain levels gear increase power level new version arbitrary levels power removed instead scaling infinitely strength reset upon entering new zoneyou need quest gather new gear particular zone still gear past zones free use upon returning zoneb people upset change different fail see surface level changes u end youre basic thing setups u exploring zone completing objectives improve performance zone move another zone gather gear complete objectives improve performance bon top release version changes improvements offer lot structure alpha world unique player created based seed full release uses seed everyone may seem like downgrade large world near infinite ever really issue bonus sharing seed making multiplayer easier alpha needed decide players seed wanted explore host simply matter getting friends location joiningthis improved consistency also allows structured quests quest go kill thing variety could rescuing trapped npc avenging town thats turned stone killing evil witch stopping power hungry faction pumping mana ground huge contraptions top youre finding tomes crypts tell lore area simplistic honest gives context theme areas explorethe complaint ive seen among alpha players believe merit region locking mobility items youre able increase ability traverse lands via riding pets boat hanglider well able climb without stamina loss spiked boots like combat gear items locked region must reacquired zone frustrating crossing border suddenly methods transport youve getting used gone without encouraged find youre sailing across area great speeds youre likely find well exploration rewards never lost youd much likely miss things subsequent regions thus slowing progression causing frustration regardless mind restriction minimaltldr summaryif youre type loves exploring procedurally created open worlds simple tight responsive combat youll enjoy game put numerous hours alpha currently full release genuinely enjoy game solo fun rewarding playing coordinating friends even better majority people upset game firmly believe simply resistant change things different norm also think overly fixated levels justify time theyve put game really arbitrary number doesnt mean anything general im linear levels system dont find realistic lazy representation character progression done decades people understand gets job done though many critics game would believe otherwise fun rewarding games dont rely levels stats zelda prime examplei admire developers trying something even little different think game deserves time cube world game us waiting forever finally doesnt take long see different game previously first bit turned changed view point game longer rpg mmo style grind mobs kind game adventure game like zelda explore stronger get amass good collection gear slowly conquer world love new iteration game love see wollay continues work gameps go play water biome rewarded handsomely cube world current state reminds lot mans sky upon release landscapes amazing fun explore first hours fun moving region youre feels terrible gear worthless lose glider boat saddle things youve collected reward reseting comes form artifacts laughably bad lamp brightness swimming

awful youre either getting one shot youre one one shottingi cant recommend game current state progressing game feels bad youve beaten zone two theres nothing pushing keep going cube worlds steam release sees revamped exploration loop consisting exploring mapped region visiting new bordering region update support fully supporting exploration removing complexity grinding stat progression cube

removed little upsetting grinding isnt really thing anymore game could definitely first time player features help time felt self googling simplest things overall found cubeworld enjoyable experience need fixes gameplay really could adjustments give developer chance listen reviews address cubeworld great base sadly cut short locking progress regions game makes sense progression take constant steps back pretty sad compared alpha quests events expanded made feel alive progress locking ultimately makes worse game alpha personally feel still worth pricetag gets rework progression however clear yes cubeworld relaxed rpg lots adventure fun intense fighting want love game bit world super fun cute totally recommend game anyone everyone cubeworld maybe best recent case shouldnt go situation previous expectations perhaps shouldnt always trust opinions othersthe gameplay loop still exists alpha say still kill enemies get loot still exploring map delving dungeons youll collecting items craft potions gear wont dealing time gated ability gain feeling like youve beaten entire game fully clearing single zonea lot people complaining work gone reality added greatly gameplay loop offers reason explore one area yes gear early help new zone items finding priority youll need amass lore clear dungeonspeople hating system foreign im tell game still fun explore loot upgrade components havent gone anywhere anything iteration given lasting power dont buy hype often itll burn cubeworld brilliant experience based leveling rpg set world cubes alpha recent update diverts classical rpg experience instead rely completely armour weapon stats completely ditch experience points played original cubeworld alpha different experience one may become used however mean bad experience one unaccustomed time spent looking crafting buying new armour weapons find conquering first biome collecting first relics point find another divergence original game moving across border biomes hide items collected far except resources relic upgrades point need start build characters items equipment conquer new biome progress world cubeworld review two partspart paranoid region locked equipment illconceived mechanic didnt work way dev wanted part paranoid region locked equipment method finish game without actually create rpg content decide dont cause point game isnt worth paying even worth playing free final word disappointment current cube world feels like get dropped world guidance impossible know unless look horrible progression curve currently cant recommend game anyone current state game improvedissues currently others also resolved change review currently worth price prealpha release quite shady move developer want game consider wait proper update currently played almost played time partner honestly played game hardcore yearsour first region rough idea id love see tutorial type stuff fabled gear seems way rare needs craftable something besides pretty happyour main concern game current system enjoy definitely everyone minority id like see transparency devs linear progression alongside already havewatch videos game purchase minority isnt bothered regions recommend game currently would recommend unless changes madethe game play loop understandable point get lot gutted initial release would understand got power downgrade till accomplished something new zone quite maybe full reset power along fact character never improves way using normal attacks ultimate improvements changes whole game add taking away mobility zone glider riding boat climbing gloves talk every npc without knowing tell new quests lot tedium real permanent reward benefits getting artifacts mobility items improvements unusable soon enter new zone things tweaked even removed tweaked would say could recommendable know full game yet things need addressed content added consider worth currently game play limitedi feel like game could one region nothing else dont feel like im exploring new world everything set disappointed character leveling lacks customization overall feels like empty copy paste experiencei like small features like abilities classes fun float sorcerer feel empty playing game lackluster think would help creator would used couple years bounce feedback players get take instead kept developer bubble cute colourful game lots potential really good since made people game development work people realise especially building game enginewhile development may slow due amount people working game recommend cute fun easy grab play friends solo love character art disclaimer review based upon beta build although updates game bugfixesi loved game alpha would like tell still case unfortunately game really enjoyable anymore lose everything change zones understand sake exploration problem taking stuff away players feels absolutely terrible players try think another game takes gear way cant come one sure hope game receives major changes would love enjoy playing iti know wollay spent long time making passion project happy see come fruition disappointed direction gone wollay please listen community love game want see amazing beas game definitely fun hours go next area shit hits fan also main progression system tied blue purple stats glidingsailing speed light radius get artifact stats increase problem cant benefit upgrades unless items required use even increase stats via artifacts like supposed dont benefit find item needi would recommend game anyone looking hours fun although much gameplay bit steep anyone cares project would like see happens ui would stay away u personally following game since early alpha sticking around hopes things turn better dont buy itits cash grab idea got steam first place got like years ago instead adding features removed got steam milk money people believe lies pathetic dont buy game make sure get somewhere dev wont compensated totally screwed game gave empty promises mods thing make game fun damn wollay destroyed game alphapros infinite world smooth performancecons skill trees anymore ability upgrades anymore progression glider boat anything else unlock one land locked land difficulty jumps lose progress every new land enterim really sure game entirely changed alpha already pretty decent bought alpha loved received beta key due picroma account alpha purchased asking absurd dont buy game worth price game isnt fun used wasnt upset wollay disappearing giving updates years im disappointed fact updated game something different damn thought wasted years wait sale orwait game completely reworked stops fun hours dashed hopes dreams game dear wollayi wrote soon found could publish language reflects game released yet internet feral place grasp shield youre storm tactful hate lot people played alpha loved iti played alpha lot idea infinite progression beautiful figured youd able build system make worthwhile keep going keep exploring instead removed old system decided add artifacts give permanent stat increases secondary stats really arent worth grinding fordont take criticism malice instead look saying game loop missing something keep interested maybe collect artifact choose bonus goes limited secondary stats character power building core game play mechanic every rpg however dont let power zone zone force players reacquire gear every land dont give power make worth keep going dont really care climbing speed boat travel speed sorryi love new travel systems one thing probably able happen make people able travel friends clicking needing bird also able travel directly towns center instead hoof seconds get bird every time want teleport friendgood luck look forward seeing changes additions make future dear wollayyour game got issues regionlocking skilltree leveling grind regionlock could better really want game could need clear region going next one complete region gear equipped gets take next region could regions require cercent level personally would go remove regionlock really takes away grind loved alpha game exploring skilltree nice could build character way wanted play spells default changing two classes isnt really intriguing since already added new spells class could made big skilltrees variety different skills different class leveling makes sense want artifacts game atleast give worthy stat swimming stamina boatspeed hangglidingspeed etc useless dosent reward player alli hyped liked first hours gameplay every since gone downhill game isnt fun straigth boring thought people kind dumb saying alpha better take opinion back alpha better beta sorry fucked upeverything needed make game good waskeep alpha add things added beta comes quests ended broken game real boring getting legendary dosent really feel rewarding get gameplay game dosent feel like grinding full legendary set gameplay isnt grind tbh really wouldnt recommend game anyone buy atm bad fixed decent challenge beautiful world passing borders renders items useless get decent game maybe worth full price ever goes sale would good price played alpha version maybe hours forgotten completely playing steam versionoverall game simple price world shallow lacks enough varied content make want fight different biomes regions game focused exploration isnt really much see enjoyable experience hours realize enough content keep goinggraphics atmosphere cube world charming graphics music endearing games emulated style game really nails npcs monsters landscape joy look wish varied npcs types towns however might explored biomes yet coastalocean region cool pirate towns opposed normal towns forest biomes music great game goes great classic osts like chrono triggergamplay combat probably best aspect game overall simple unbalanced warrior probably best class tree simple enough depth keep things interesting example warriors balance mp rage meter stamina block power bar stun lock moves classes simple focus pure damage dps ranged classes probably strong exploit large enemies hiding bridges entrance ways wish combo counter played bigger role combat gear little bit important combat would like skill based combat elements like stuns shouldnt based purely random chance done right time stun increased damage boss enemies basically dps fests arent really tactics strategies needed chug potions keep swinging warrior cool tricks block mechanics classes need kite attempt facetankdodge stamina runs trying get stun procas core gameplay loop hunt artifacts boost exploration skills horde gear items used surrounding regions exp bar tradtional sense leveling combat progression gear based based skill start game hard playing hours potions knowhow easily kill monster tiers gear level bigger issues major balance issues early game classes seems weaker less synergistic others example early game hard get starting gear guides recommend kitting blue tier mobs friendly ai kill pick loot kiting mobs respawn point dying spamming ultimate move slowly damage kill game also fair number bugs items spawning like glider nowhere found enemy ai generally dumb easily getting stuck walls handle different concept leveling dont mind losing gear going new region game decently fun play could use events types towns monsters big quest chains factions decent game took get best friends decidedly worth wait bought back developer ghosted long time honestly feel better wasnt great elements became favorite parts breath wild climbing gliding exploration etc truly shame definitely lot playtime incoming fun friendseditafter months change negative patches anything promised launch dev went full silence mode definitely asks much money fun action rpg get somewhat stale hours highly suggest getting sale definitely worth buy people angery get waht exactly wanted take fact masterpiece game developed two people thats insane sure would need tweaks fixes current characterdevelopment system around sweet game think worth support wolfram von funck believe brings us many great updates future enjoy stay crazy world cubez despite hate know buying great game none less despite trash thrown game justified tho still think enough care devolper game still saved loved game younger since great sure return past glory even rise even despite many issues would still recommend game good qualities believe still worth checking currently hours gamethere already many reviews touch key points also since received key alpha player didnt buy steam review doesnt count anyway towards overall review score valve policy fault picroma going use opportunity pitch personal suggestions improve game case devs go looking sort constructive feedbackwhat would personally improve gameplaytake kingdoms lore read make real actual borders would uncover discover lore tablets make encompass multiple zones certain gear would lock would greatly extend loop gameplay could venture several zones start overnot gear needs kingdom locked higher tiered gear id say purpleyellow maybe blue lower tiered gear could carried freely kingdoms penaltymake gear craft finding books locked kingdom also bring back dropped recipes find make single use lock whatever kingdom craft inmake world quest either progressed completed collecting certain number artifacts saving certain number kingdoms additionally wanted add progressive difficulty make worlds difficulty increase incrementally kingdom savedincrease region size double least make connected biomes type one region stated several regions part larger kingdommake world bit less archipelago continents landlocked regionsspread movement tools around world bit necessarily one every region balance allow locked kingdom give value locateadd storage stash system pass along gear charactersfinally would add vendor kingdom hefty price unlock piece gear locked another kingdom bind current one would sometimes worth since higher tiered gear would locked especially trouble finding would also give point passing gear players would give gold additional value despite reviews game still relatively enjoyable play hope community creator come compromise regarding region lock cool idea maybe implemented strange way super fun play though despite general consensus find get initial bump understanding ui ends quite fun play theres always something find explore gear item upgrade boss beatcertainly comparable alpha slightly different ways seem infuriated community despite reviews saying mobs difficult actually think game good much fun however recommend playing friend despite many people felt entitled think game lot fun ive definitely gotten worth fun game enjoy sprawling map make regions various biomes explore castles underground dungeons mines fricking borg etc fantastic run sure learning curve thats part appeal real penalty death best way learn keep playing granted quality life changes id like arent deal breakers means im able jump friends worlds mine seemlessly quick flight path im able play explore friends awesome understand thought going get rpg half decade ago action adventure game pretty awesome lot cleverness theres room grow despite people saying game really great already even tho monsters oneshot theres like higher level allies kill xp skill tree gone doesnt stop changed separate classes like rouge assassins ninjas neat plains gorgeous look around even night time scary roam could find rockling beating mess overall despite hate highly recommend game wants experience feels like low become broken character start gets boring soon hit new regionheres thing would say game nothing really poor reviews see game basicly funny ridiculous people treating game triple game developed people people would expect give game free create game mmorpg game single playermultiplayeroptional gave ups downs literally everything arsenal provide want get top tier gears company would sponsors game would see game better place due stupendous gaming community expecting game full gameto would go hours game wouldnt recommend reading reviews basicly scan game bias intent either hate game going away years expecting game triple game final product people saying ghosted despite people say mods stop region locking thing improve game little give try would suggest buying goes sale dev cash grab back like years ago trying grab money steam peeps dont buy game dev dissapeared yet againi want like gamei want funi want waste thousands hours exploring game offerbut hours ive played game times overthere less content version old alphaand even terrain generation looked amazing vibrant alpha version bland flat mehi want love thisi cant makes sad dev releases first version us early backers years ago vanishes returns years later completely dumbed version steam release vanishes againwith development cycle lack communication like really cannot recommend assume nothing cash grab dev seems ghosted official release including deleted cube world blog expect updates near far future game near unplayable state right way enjoy get lucky start arent spawned legendary enemies dungeons minute one even progress youve made disappear moving one region next gear reverted gray quality moment leave region obtained get rare equipment retains quality bordering regions still lose value walk another region away origination point items may even class lose everything else youve obtained including mobility items glider reins pet matter artifacts would possibly remedied situation increase stats move speed around diminishing returns swim speed climb speed lantern radius none actually particularly useful dev spent years alpha release broke fundamentals really hope hes trying make right wont change review till alpha game really fun thoedit alpha beta smart developer abandoned game hell probably blame players like usual expect update four years game back released least fun back didnt require mod enjoyed developer basically spent last years stripping away nearly everything made game good begin beyond theres almost new content compared alpha feels like cashgrab developer currently talk community games obvious major issues many simple fixes currently make progression worth time good developers disappear day game even releases first time done community cant really give review based alonethe game well worth bucks pocket change youll hours fun based game alone developers act recommend game developper made quick cash disapeared game potential feels heavily unfinished would recommend devs ghosted community years community payed game praised released version game broke good things alpha hadnope nope one everyone devs removed windows support explanation alpha content messthe game ready release diamond rough tweaks could see region lock idea working edit mods disable region lock tweak liking though tbh felt like sense progression stronger alpha due skills locked behind levels enjoy progression elements game like region locks lot bugs including one prevented even able click start game one point hoping maybe would fixed seems creator deleted everything moved dont get refund late play game earlier bought directly release already played hours love game design problem suddenly play game start game appear system tray click window game crashes closes immediately already reinstalled game checked corrupt files restarted pc rebooted timesmaybe someone help would nice different imagined im disappointed good differently worth playing right disappointing feels barebones alpha could still pretty good game decent updates expect get lack communication wollay leading beta release incredibly frustrating doesnt bode well games futuretwo changes would drastically improve game larger regions size regular regions scaling past stars make artifacts give either cool effects like legendaries risk rain combatmovement stats instead garbage like light radiusdont buy worth appropriate given state disappointing nothing like alpha made great sincerely hope patched like alpha later update disappointing could least little bit hope dev would update would wait refund right im certain left untouched devs would run away money like years ago disappointment powerful enough word describe disclaimer alpha owner got early access based experiences versionas much want sing praises game simply cannot bought years ago played crap beta enjoyed heck decided wait patiently whatever news came fateful day twitter happened wollay said would release steam literally cheered available sadly different gamewhat personally paid years ago rpg skill trees progression incarnation skill trees progression lost everytime go new region save artefacts give minor bonuses gear worked worth nothing next area may able keep quality gear nearby zones become worthless eventuallythen fact alpha playable windows first said store page well without word windows removed system requirements without word developer rely fan made patch add missing dll files works finewhat happened wollay first started sell game horrible getting ddosed morale shattered sucks promised first bought gamei sadly cannot reccomend state best luck wollay best luck disclaimer kinda rant dont wanna read lot go bottom conclusionsooo like many others also pretty disappointed polished promising alpha great potential entirely different repetitive game came tbh ithe gameplay bad also needs polish like actual reward going diffrent biomes every biome feels like started new game compared alphaso even though heard bad reviews beta willing give shot loved alpha much spend hours hours travelling villages leveling pretty nice already added variations skills weapons class one first things noticed fun leveling removed skills already way upgrade choose paths liked leveling aspect whole rpg feel thats bummer however worst thing die happens often repawn shrine previously activate therefore find even map difficult probabaly spawn waaay away spend minutes getting back without riding boats hangglider tedious items also found scattered around big map every biome dont find via quest go every location till get ability ride pet case last items got didnt want go onto next areas cross border everything gone useless yay region bound items greaaaat entire travel one region taking looooong time youre lucky maybe bit completely useless waste time soon move another region lets honest one really cares relicsthese points really outweigh improvements changes made really hope could go back cube world least try make better comfortable experienceno one wants hard work undone crossing border youre alpha would recommend stick wait till version improves buy right rather bad game itselfedit also crafting got harder since recources majorly reduced getting potion crafted armour also difficult ever disjointed barebones worth time like game yeswill recommend friends dependingdoes game need work yesim middle ground love game support wollay bias let stop saying game flaws still however keep

took everything liked gutted reworked game something clearly inspired openworld games like breath wild theres basically leveling region locking makes game awful compared used bealso let us mention fact wollay main developer cannot trusted vanished face earth alpha phase suspiciously quiet past week may took money ranupdate lmao fucking joke took money ran away glad didnt spend money game filthy scum like dev doesnt deserve anything dont buy game current state incredibly poorly designed instead pirate alpha version superior gameif game alpha added content would happy hours playing game cant bring play anymore cant find reason tothe game development years since released alpha barely added anything stated website going addduring time beta wollay acknowledged criticism development never hinted changing core gameplay completelythe game promote exploring region locking gear meaning step outside border current region gear becomes useless cant ride mount use boat use glider meaning start everytime want explore new areasa complex skill tree promised removed skill tree completely skills beginning meaning never get incredible feeling increasing powerthe progression game absolutely horrible reward get clearing entire region artifact might increase light radius increase gliding speed xp anymore fighting mobs encouraged unless need gold way bossi like added quests new skills music good tooyou dont increase power steady pace absolutely useless early game getting wrecked llamas dogs depending class continue getting wrecked get good weapon drop game jokemore classes playable races promised none added even new hairstylesstay clear game dont buy game seriouslygo get crack old vesion way funseem like woolay run money shat piece get dont buy game probably already know dev unreliable takes years post updates even news game general deaf player feedback lot fun alpha back days forsaken broken piece software terrible game design decisions lack proper support isnt worth time money spent gamedev actually takes care gamecommunity dont buy game cash grab developers gives much content repeats worth anything dont buy game worth money wont funding development youll giving old man wife money dont deserve putting enough work technically show game really must wait sale knock price buck dont buy got worse time development im sure developer actually lot work went wrong direction almost nothing except remove important things add new content changes make game less fun less fun would even consider pointless theres really lot game good things already beforei didnt refund sole purpose satisfying nostalgia time time hopes new updates ever happen dont buy dev speaks like years dont come game expecting alpha version took get used zone based mechanics hours completely fine hours later im still fun cant wait hop friend take legendary demon boss hard solo please ignore alpha beta haters unless course logical complaint think fun game considering buy game would recommend hit want coop dont dudes worth wollay doesnt deserve money disappearing six years deliver game less content alpha dont even bother huge difficulty spike soon start game seems like thing explore get punished dont expect updates buy cant recommend current state years im really disappointed dont get game updated since release theres really much content game developer abandoned game soon released save money something better dont know came mind wollay decided make changes made alpha absence exp whatsoever exp character whos described level stats time lead think unlock sort levelling class skills maybe progression acquiring better gear upgrading already owned equipment crafting better stuff accessed magic crafting books acquiring artifacts enhance travelling skills character class progression choosing invest level points garbage one previously mentioned features alpha absent release class progression makes everything shallow pointless feel earning skills hard workregion locked gearitems one makes going beyond starting region frustrating youve already probably acquired top tier gear useful items boat glider reins etc none regions like starting scratch beside artifacts gained wow sail faster regions started first one another thing upgrading weapons alpha gems used add specific attributes weapons thing adding iron cubes basic shape selected weapons increase damage another change made game even dull seas used full life empty water algaeall features combined make going beyond first area pointless important regions justify stuff worked previous hours least nothing time youve done everything important first region game dead seriously years get really tried best impartial playing hours even disagreeing reviews really harsh towards game completing starting region beside bugs got way core mechanics say wollay wasted six years idea great full potential players expressing preferences almost fully customize characters gear something lifespan triple game hours nothing im really disappointed first time supported many alpha releases say could go back time wouldnt purchased game first placewollay last comment meant addressed directly youi totally think cube world needs reworking needs something alpha artifact hunting levelling nice like probablyjacob stated video youtube gives indiana jones feel pretty new unheard games artifacts granted power increasing mere level stat travelling speeds artifacts unlocking precious skill levels points attribute points travelling speed upgrades features either clustered artifact scattered various kinds classes artifacts randomizing binding type artifact specific benefit specific type location let players able tell first glance whether dungeon theyre going explore suits need characters keeping old alpha skill level progression features like deep weapon customization spirit gems armor customization would nice tooi dont really get developer could use years enrich game scraping feature feature leaving result barren tasteless really dont get dont know say people havent already fun game region locking removal xp system skill tree ruined dont let negative reviews make get game extremely fun charming dont let alpha testers fool youre discovering cube world first time fantastic piece work one good single player adventure games dont let playtime fool played numerous hours alpha years years ago features charm replaced walking simulator core gameplay loop exploration actively punishes exploring taking away tools boatsglider weapons bother exploring new land lose everything process like theres story enjoy loop attempting explore losing everything ive earnedits worth looking developers twitter history see numerous features seemingly tore game around cities better looking world generation factions im sure much cant arsed dig brings back painful memories could worth buy right theres potential wollay reverts changes listens people supported begin dont listen hype game still great fun multiplayer experience dont trust reviews mad game different alpha removed content replaced different content works differently recommend trying refunding dont like personally love dont waste timeits sad true alpha years ago significantly better progression ability explore without punished either become powerful never leave birth place leave birth place forever doomed weakest new land encountered say weak mean oneshot beetle weak tediously weak point hunt rabbits roaming land hoping find slowly youll become strong enough take beetle eventually youll raid castleand explore new lands well fool prepared start hunting rabbits least glider boat say wrong prepared reunlock everything every new locationand least play friends say well friend seconds behind time disconnecting times youve google life thus far yes multiplayerstay clear stay clear dont listen pleps dont know nothing went game played hours like different give negative rating sad game awesome fun hours game least played hours days tells love side region lock dont like easy fix go google get mod remove big problemthe game much many new enemies many many regions biomes loads pets sword play styles like minecraft world warcraft feel remember give game slack made one person one updates slow update near perfection want read real comment isnt bunch hatters weaklings go overall reviews change settings play time hours people actually played game fullest played way wolly wanted played give dont get wrong game good cerain exten great game hit hours lot content form alfa missing used hopefully fix game time pray obamadidnothingwrong dont know game getting much hate love give shot dont listen reviews amazing game play lone friends need remember game made mostly one person wife free time triple game payed make gameif want buy game buy please keep mind isnt fortnite call duty game updates dont come weekly come singualar human done making update downgrade alpha version dev seem interested improving working game drama aside current state cant recommend game many reasons character progression changes removal features alpha region locking gear obtuse ui design mostly boils gameplay loop feeling rewarding funthe aesthetic gorgeous like look world sadly enjoyable play inif possible mod game id say pick total conversion mod available pulls large list community requested features otherwise wait deep sale drastically different alpha versionstill great game would even better different progression systemmaybe keep different movement items biomes better perks clearing areas dreams come true drop world see bunch enemies across mostly flat mostly featureless terrain kill gain two coins time repeat wonder game hiding fun shut offsome sort hook beginning tell player go greatly needed players shouldnt look guides enjoy gamethe funny moment leading slime inside sewer town watching like npcs couldnt inflict damage least hopelessly outmatched dude game like rogue like play like rogue like games basically stripped everything good game due alpha good extent way approach going new region believe changed due enemies face next region tap levelling system helps combat dumbed combat progression systemall gear reset everytime leave map region including items like boat yeah boat desintegrate feet becouse traverse invisible lineno form permanent progression edit october recent development cube world modding community certain mod maker managed salvage game actually make game enjoyable play game mod game fine mod removes dreadful region locked gear items adds scaling mobs gear improves artifacts allows turn pvp adjusts item drop rates however still dont recommend buy game simply dont think support creator however access game already check original review wrote september heard monkeys paw artifact based supernatural story grant user wish condition wish cursed related cube world well let tell youthe game first got released alpha version back become extremely popular gained lot fans core mechanics game good game fun needed content bit polishing bug fixing july game got update contained couple bug fixes last time cube world alpha would receive updateafter creator game known wollay went silent decided lock inside echo chamber continue developing game without feedback suggestions community would occasionally post new teaser image video new things added game twitter account form communication existed wollay cube world community however would never say expect new changes rather expect update years went lot people lost hope simply gave point people believed game would never receive updatethats monkeys paw comes play someone obtained wished cube world update happened wish granted september wollay announced game released steam community went nuts everyone ecstatic hear news people couldnt believe years practically nothing silence game known cube world almost everyone loved enjoyed playing would receive update however thats curse monkeys paw started seep inon september cube world beta released anyone bought alpha game back received free steam key game everyone hopped game expected game fun full new things teased shown years twitter long game launched beta players noticed something odd game noticed much game changed fact lot things present game back missing skill trees experience points leveling system different user interface couple hours people started noticing even elements game made game well fun anymorethe big change occured new cube world wasnt present alpha version regionlocked progression system means gear obtain one region game biome utility items found region usable region one utility items boat lets sail move faster providing better experience moving water surfaces however regionlocked system end happening boat decide move away initial plains hills region go ocean region start sailing soon cross invisible border separates plains ocean region boat simply vanish makes sense visually doesnt feel good gameplaywise new region means gotta find new boat new hang glider new pair climbing spikes onthis kind regionlocked system punishes players exploring game forces look utility items time decide explore new region might worse fact equipment armor weapons jewelry also regionlocked lets say spend hours complete one region explore everything full set legendary star gear best kind gear game decide move different region might even notice first moment attack first monster belongs different region youll notice suddenly deal damage quickly youll realize gear basically nullified provides stats thats right weapons youve looted armor youve gained jewels youve found magically become useless cross invisible border step foot new region means gotta start scratch start zerothere however one thing carries one region another fact bound character artifacts artifacts monkeys paw would kinda cool game able somehow make wish game ends cursing wish gives sort punishment something like artifacts cube world sort main goal game youre supposed collect artifacts might ask theyre elaborate complex monkeys paw dont increase attack speed give fire damage lifesteal grant necromantic powers allow raise zombies skeletons artifacts cube world provide permanents stats bound character increase movement stats sailing speed climbing speed swimming speed riding speed diving speed even lamp radius lamps toggled f key provide small light radius around character active small amount example start meter lamp radius start artifacts boost lamps light radius meter radius thats cool rewarding right youve spent couple hours gearing questing adventuring region end road got bonus meter light radius lampthis fun game needs revamp alpha version game good basis leveling system really emphasised character progression somehow years development current game feels emptier shallower previous version game game couldve much wollay listened wollay talked dont think anyone wished happeni recommend game current state edit seen absolutely z e r discussion wollay changes trying improve game hope would something improve experience far ive seen none something changes im going negativeend editi enjoy game really needs worki dont mind concept region locking gear dont even oppose removal experience game needs system gear locking needs reworking artifacts made less worthless less like improved exploration stats actuality dont expect get experience level becoming broken become stronger finish region gear becomes worthless rest usually make sure watch video know youre getting im giving positive review hours say enough im horribly disappointed lack community acknowledgement lots people plenty good ideas yet seemingly zero recognition edit thanks modders mods remove stupid region locking gear improve drop rates scaling ect make game bit fun closer believe people want regardless doesnt fix game still stand mentioned review thus revised allthis review hopefully publicise feedback devs provide believe constructive criticism aid development gamecube world love child zelda minecraft know everyone makes comparison pretty truecube world large open world rpg game voxel graphics mainly focuses questing explorationthe map huge theres lot quests get cute pets help battle game looks niceso whats missinga lot like lotcube world moment feels like suffers huge sandbox enough sand fill awfully large world run around explore theres actually lot inside theres dungeons scattered around random enemies spend time running away actually fighting quests usually high level clutter map teasing bits pieces lore towns youll spend minutes leave thats movement feels nice floaty plenty control wish sprinting wasnt class exclusive getting around places hella slow teleport shrines life discover thats activate exploring new areas takes ages hang glider bit whack wont get far unless get really high airnow biggest gripes areequipment localised map segmented different areas unique biomes extensions said biomes whatever reason enter one new areas equipment including key items locked region found could maybe see someone would implement think utterly stupid design makes already slow progression even slower leveling skills dont exist make assumptions removed functionality removal pretty bad really hope system refurbished reimplemented skill system maybe perks levels existing makes character progression feel kinda lackluster due limited equipment mentioned bound region find starting really slow dont know well bit unlucky solo multiplayer found trying get new gear actually challenge tougher enemies dungeons quite slow made feel like running around exact stuff considering ive played hours time review id say kinda disappointing saying id like see lot things things ive mentionedsmother progression transition higher level content leveling added provide way properly gauge content player tackling provide extra bonuses stats outside armour well wider range low mid tier level enemies dungeons common starting areas perhaps also properly flesh questing system established quest log specific npcs give big quests like bounty board something would work give gold xp rare items andor equipment fill map dungeons enemy camps random buildings explore loot lore something else besides quest locations arenas cool start could find ones doesnt anything someone whos barely cant get much furtherjust misc stuff like improvements hud make menus tidier added sorting features options hide change information displayed around map key items size said hud features imagine already thought devs still want mention casesmoother combat maybe bigger differences alt classes changes buffs certain skills general balancing would nice id imagine something like already considered current state expected change example said changes would like spitball would warrior shift ability sluggish hard transition youre already attacking shield throw would nice long range aggro catcher ranged damage hang glider could retain altitude longer dip much upon start flight could bad gliding feels like large drop intended boat never stops grapple sorts would cool swing gain height glide maybe climbing could bit quicker means suggestions merely suggestions means objective things would like see believe would improve game also suggestions could potentially already considered works devs really really hope see game grow people finally feel like wait worth seeing negative reviews articles bashing game makes upset also understand people feel way however still going recommend game feel like fundamentally game fun lacks material reach wider audience retain attention said audience took money ran im guessing twitter last active sep wont getting good game unable post review closed

different alpha way added quests objectives feel game requires time effort come great reward alpha straight combat quick lvl full release need find items complete certain missions gain knowledge travelers grind people need give time doubting game well needs balanced im sure update forum discussion pros cons difficult alpha still open world mmorpg made cubes game still looks amazing added lot new things worth say last review worth saying long played wrote longer agree recommending time reasons realize play actually get good armour weapons game becomes easy simple walk different region story really high hopes game seems like years let eh pretty noice friends empty game making player start scratches isnt good way go game lost everything fun enjoyablewould nice little fleshed exploration easier enjoying mess gamethe progression system different rpgs doesnt mean bad ive thoroughly enjoyed game changes made wollay pixxie keep good work certainly grow niche community around indie development one look forward future hope enough said game get would consider game complete advertised like aspects game originally advertised pulled game mechanics abnormal intuitive players isnt exactly main issue extension entire system counter intuitive players incentives contradictory game tells progression system removes progress create infinite loop instead giving player control reset resets games control core issue efforts directly applied characters progression randomness limitations put place remove control turn chore game game epic game im happy saw post twitter telling cube world released steami say kinda forgot tbh saw developer active twitterand downloded play itnearly yearsfeel old yet even years still charming gameit still got lot flaws definetly enjoyable ill play friends lot futureim happy everything lets hope future updates fix ittheres much love game tell even doesnt expected game love game unconditionally good luck wollay even game doesnt best rewarding system still get hooked playing hours even pixelark better progression even tho game basicly got ruined better alpha would actually recommend new gameplay acutally adventure get missions npcs game witch nice even though got free cant recommend itwhile original game lot flaws nice setting could expanded uponwhich happened good waya lot systems worked alpha got butchered game got ditched againdont see point coming back changing main systems game ditching itdisappointed fans twicegame might worth ever sale bucks isnt worth even though heard bad things beta decided pick cube world anyways think fun like gameplay loop going different regions ransacking artifacts like indiana jones sort deal mainly problem minuscule artifact buffs think higher might break game however one thing criticize region lock mostly issue really annoys star gear one region useless another suggestion gear one region isnt completely useless regions example star gear could downgraded star gear depending stats star gear turns star star turns star etc would make actually able defend first enter new region also clarify plus gear would act normal exit plus gears radius downgrades occur another suggestion hanglider boat reigns work way suggestion gear example crossing ocean border boat first region disappear instead becomes slower gains kind debuff way get boat back regular speed get boat region cross region border farther one first crossed boat disappear kinda like plus gear would work hanglider stamina speed debuff reigns ride speed debuff rest region locked gear harp bell flute etc stay work one thing hope things endgame added game basically infinite loop right maybe like new biomes old cut content readded spice gameplay players complete regions also actual story would cool keep player motivated perhaps even ending although would work similar minecraft player still play ending taken consideration believe new version cube world could truly special great many people wishing xp skill trees top region unlocking like game needs reworks system content even though game changed lot compared alpha still believe update straight upgrade fun playhoping see game go future even though reviews pretty rough would still recommend game player alpha beta game enjoyable graphics replayability decent try leave good comment decent criticism instead blatant hatred devs might update better even though restart every region still recommend finish zone find refreshing new zones experience gearing finding items new zones decide explore everthing fun game removedno exploration gear degrades

thinking game realize things werent made game good gear loot exploration go entirely different dungeon fight zone regather gear part fun exploring sense enjoy fetch quests would get serious kick style rpg personally biggest fan worst thing ever people making seem lastly whole system artifacts stuff honestly best rpg style ive ever seen game whole life way leveling xp literally personally wanting ever rpg ive ever played issue average popular rpg tedious like something keys bunch attacks crap dont need long annoying tedious side quests super simple xp system scrapes little rpg always sets average story isnt really worth dealing ive always wanted simply explore rewarding cube world exactly know gonna say well wrong lose gear equipment explore new biomes well say thats true sense see dont really lose gear loses power new biome retaining strength biome found giving option backtrack want gear items lore artifacts missed give actual buffs like climbing speeds gliding speed easy way travel around youve looked shrines life really think game tough spot late hit hard true rpg players used xp questing system fail see games repetitive tasks really well game amazing highly recommend

questsartifacts bonuses dont really impact gameplay first things first game breathtaking new quest monsters amazing theres one thing feel easily fixed game doesnt feel like progressing heres think would solve dont change leveling process port three class abilities alfa make artifacts give points invest artifacts lower numbers give higher percent boost ability like gliding sailing would make even better also gave small damage defense boost feel like getting stronger abilities overtime see slightly stronger op feel like moving forward first things first im alpha player review wont count

even enjoy game see whyif looking rpg fight enemies hours get better gear isnt game however like exploring finding items gear friends game perfect exploration quests map system greatthis game could use improvements games hope bad reviews taken good light devs update game everyone happy much possible anyways first game much less features alpha years ago second due gutting much except sit trees farm also nothing tell tells maybe half controls thats options btw see controls thirdly high price tag ridiculous recommend current stage firstly would like begin saying game changed much lot great things new cube world however many bad things added well great finally got cube world feel like cube world feels like cheap skin name cube world thrown top progression wasnt great alpha cube world wasnt bad either new cube worlds progression times worse xp killing mobs creatures almost useless unless need gold mobs drop progression combat also lacking none begin abilities skills nothing improved along way skill trees gone build paths wouldve made cube world little bit interesting gone even gear progression gone start nothing spend precious time gaining star equipment realize whole biome weak youre strong balance even worse cross new biome hard earned items gear weapons become useless rating drops zerothis game longer based skill old cube world could take mightiest bosses poor gear long worked hard skill fight whereas solely based gear alone take bosses complete quests also gear based luck went zone took hours get good gear another zone got full set star gear minutes playtime kind dumb ask end game revolves around collecting artifacts dont much besides give minor sub stat boost riding speed hang glider lantern radius etc half time arent even able use boosts dont items use lose hard earned items crossing border fuck wants go find boat hang glider want explore beautiful world cube world understand special items spirit bell magic harp etc disappearing items helps us get around obtained interesting quest stay us permanentlywollay talks exploration big part game game feels like forced stick one biome complete every single task course dont stay one biome youre progress resets leave probably wont get artifacts within become strong enough could either quick long happen walking big part game spend large chunk playtime walking travelling rather enjoying playing game way game played dont get started repetitive boring quests complete zone may move next one quests tasks things supposed recycled every zone find self thing every zone isnt anything innovative new cube world beta cube world didnt need rework need updated improved new things added barely touched surface issues cube world beta im aware gear believe fix cube worlds region lock want gear stays cross borders biomes scale whomever enters instead everything one shotting u begin remember allowed personalize gear add colored spirit cubes make unique one color useless since use personalized weapons single biomea lot people may experienced friends lagged badly multiplayer whomever hosting session player experiencing perfect gameplay tried switch hosts every player till lag stopped lag persisted every host migration games controls weird ui awful old ui better old combat better old hanglider better hell even old progression better like idea artifacts way wollay gone rubbish opinion artifacts imo provide sub stat boost also give one stat point player choose put large interesting skill tree allows players experiment different builds example play warrior could invest points would improve sustain tankiness invest points build would improve attack speed life steallife leech etc many things showcased wollays twitter website even make new game utterly disappointed new cube world firmly believe dont see proper fixes tweaks improvements game fall continue stay alpha cube worlds shadow also apologies poor writing skills firstly ignore reviews september reviews alpha version rather beta game changed much consider different game alphanow game much wanted like cannot recommend literally garbage progression system trash barely progress

make different kinds big small avian lizard etc way region explored allows riding different kind pet one must explore finally able ride favorite one without riding travel interim claws take away infinite stamina instead make set found increase efficiency climbing old logarithmic curve alpha days call progression aka improve ui currently stuff goes offscreen theres absolutely explanation class abilities anywhere grouping items region small obvious crafting tedious takes far much beef relicsartifacts significantly give us option increase combat stats instead subclass swapping going free dont make us go town put option somewhere dont let packs enemies contain multiple tiers foe since power distant white greengreen blueetc stop letting epic chilifolk absolutely stomp new players trying fight onionlings bad design fun really flying friends free let us fast travel instead saves time saves frustration increases fun factor maybe make option social menu promote stop making warriors charge specials rogues get instant melee moves lanterns need massive brightness boost make fuelbased way getting caught night isnt tedious slog though pitch darkness enemies annihilate especially since one might access fast travel points near town newest regions full disclosure recommend game current state ive already refunded keeping eye updates longer see anything new comes draws moment cube world basically blank slate could could great rpgwhy refunding gamewell honest biggest reason punishes exploring new regions basically resetting character back zero making hard earned gear worthless groundwork leveling system matter character stuck level saying game bad time played quite lot fun encountered whats basically games version brotherhood steel scaled volcano raided castle snuck

restarting often kinda fun little game gear based game loop put level continuation next loop takes time getting used fun none less fun overall rpg every new area like restarting game expect gear works surrounding areas fun sandbox game need content region lock need removed plus servers would awesome world events stuff fun start unfun continue invalidates progress region mechanic would good executed differently rather completely dropping ass try take new regions ok needs ton work done progression system isnt satisfying exploring pretty fun lacks meaningful depth time gear get region locked needs game really shine fun mods custom music easy put fun friends fun alone fun worlds explore new area challenge wish bit power progression zones overall feels fresh play new zonealso means dont need

people dont like game probably wont updated game better ever would recommend game dead crab raveupon full release game quite changes people werent aware prior unreleased version game keeping mind time took released aside silence developer side things truly take theres uproar mind still think hate matter perspective true reflection game state personal experience game isnt true reflection negative reviews big majority negative reviews due region lock although understand also preference negative reviews critique religion locking start fresh every time enter new region unless items used neighboring zones one hrs beta majority betarelease beta skill tress learn different abilities give minor stats full released get every ability unlocked minus travelinginstruments region lock released stats equipment based mostly mission progressively level gets need situation difficulty complete region almost completion get crafting books craft items next region also buy store restart every zone nothing unless even transportation gear start doesnt take away game since quite easy regain everything sometimes even better old gear firmly believe changes come progression system would able keep glider spike shoes boats reign transportation since physical objects one would keep around possibility instruments dont agree much since think like learning different melodies different regions honestly makes sense dungeons fun specially friends different classes nice partying bosses thing would recommend checkpoints dungeons certain points given dungeons really big travel someone party dies also understand might never thing since exploited itd also big deal implemented properly water regions bit tedious deal since dont start boat swim island first island go always boat available water regions quite easy complete jungle zones somewhat hit miss since sometimes vegetation dense blocks paths also harder find objectives comparison zone bosses fun exception magesrangers since bit difficult types may experience group people including also think less besides region lockingskilltree game pretty much alpha many exciting things coming future every moment game memorable music scenery adventuring made game give sense blissful happiness glad game finally official released hope wollay pixxie continue share growth beautiful project rest us excited future cube world hope

game release game masterpieceit cool watch devs come new stuff game kinda add back exp artifacts would make kinda balance dungeons really hard get artifacts sometimesplay game friends enjoy funny memes game fun enough mess around friends recommend buying full price youre going play solo maybe worth absolute maximum game fun first area clear everything essentially resets even movement items receive fun gameplay loop game fun first couple hours becomes repetitive little incentive explore clear first region outside different environments game fun right mentalityneeds tweaks mostly progression side game also needs roadmap expect kind updates promised recentlymultiplayer fun good internet needs better netcodei give game good still lacks areas still would mean cheap game get money worth game fun isnt used doesnt matter many people giving negative review isnt expected without judging game merits doesnt play want doesnt make objectively bad game progression pretty fun especially large group friends party areas great game fairly polished game runs smoothly multiplayer works well also everyone complaining spawning far friends talk flight master nearest town youll able teleport friends free explained fully patch notes earlier week looking forward content future game greatits diferent progression system works great endless style game rough state right little communication developer unlikely gonna hear anything backthere dedicated modders like nexus committed bringing back old removed features removed transition game alphaif youre still holding hope game please give

systems game pretty good far soon got legendary item started killing everything fast got pretty boring since need find strong enemy lure strong friendly allies got legendary mage staff way pretty boring recommend game soon get legendary weapon everything easy mode game really fun things gotta change dont mind region locked gear much taking away mobility switch region fun maybe make pets ridable without reins least dont walk switch region crafting books kind useless since much easier get eq means amount items required craft stuff way high gems diamonds etc way expansive worthwhile also think diamonds gold rare find would make crafting usable abilities need bit nerf trying survive fire mage ult rouges warriors idk jump hit lot times impossible since almost kill instantly even decently powerful eq artifacts meaningful ultimate goal game get many increasing small relevant stats unrewardinghopefully devs keep updating game make even fun despite toxicity game isnt good alpha much better version apparently level finding sort artifact completely stupid alpha could kill monsters get experience fun go fetch quest level dissapointing game fun take long time find artifacts game isnt really great modding helps experience unless friends would go elsewhere pray updates lads game lost soul progress non existent everything good alpha stripped beta hope game get fixed game really lacks sense progression make progress start feeling powerful first region go next region basically quest region get items game great wollay decided change game works completely ruined dissapointment immeasurable gaming experience ruined lol suck game better alpha game completely changed weak shallow experience devoid made love first place alpha feels like game whatever sad see happen one anticipated games ever please listen fans make better decisions game fun first ten hours fell late game progression form weak buffs movements stats diminishing returns still solid game needs content game good creator ran money new region wonder knows itll disappear game good initial release years ago wollay dipped released steam dipped see years epic store game great alphathese changes terrible ill change review fix progression system game much better early versions rework game thought dead updates years game suddenly pops back instead refined game big release six years completely different game thats incredibly shallow removed best selling point content apparently left years ago couldnt handle pressure sure shit happens gotta take mental health consideration sucks backers hey game cool conceptit stayed dead gettingmuch deserved criticism disappeared form social contact like first time instead communicating anything people certainly targeted wollay reviews thats nono genuine criticism since fantastic concept early game alpha current features refined itd easy enjoyable timesink deserve personal criticism simply due lack professionalism shows straight hiding everything instead dealing unreal straight release cash grab afk initially going keep opinion let game develop wollay truthfully gone back old habbits doesnt deserve anybodies money plenty better games similar vein worth time days much deserving developers dont support guy game went awesome alpha future awesome game devs personal project okregion locking makes exploration funskills longer existcrafting nearly nonexistant due limited resources generated dropped well high cost per weapongame drops higher level areas cant kill lowest level spawns tutorial anythingalpha worth wouldnt recommend one game probably never updated much hope played two hours youll never see money developer ran game wouldve good developer stayed worked refunding gameplay good challenging hopefully content continuously introduced time nonpaid dlc removal statleveling system kills ability progress well region locked glider boat etc infinite night also large concern havent found way make torch sort want spend coins town time gameplay really fun release isnt looking like hr game like people wanted price point think worth itim artifacts completed regions still ton left dogame getting daily updates leading release im hopeful continue see added fixedthe expectations game high feedback mixed believe people fun playing game get moneys worthpeople seem want gameplay sucks major disappointment cant recommend current state hopefully wollay updates thats unlikely games lack luster point id glad try actually full game geez start loved alpha waiting years update huge mess would like say please fix game like alphaspent hours grinding beta trying get two star items could progress got two three star items classes lured mobs guarding vendor gnome npss could kill vendor offers three star gear could buy gold got grinding one two star enemies basically cheating hours gameplay get better items became easy mode farm three eventually five star enemies boring combat happened old duck roll jump thump drink potion combat alpha cant beat five star dungeons yet got area complete pretty much done bother grinding next area essentially cookie cutter mess repeat thing original alpha wasnt deep progression felt fun got powerful enough take world hey play new class got tons red item artifacts also land looked really good everywhere looks generic polish alpha please rerelease steam new players also play get quests gear collect special items kill bosses get artifactsthen like rpg go new area get new gear sounds like standard rpg fare maybe would nice keep movement options thats balance issue enough dislike game get grindy fun give second try ive really enjoying mage give time get therethere major differences alpha build theres need jump final conclusions right away give time try see like changes made enjoying slight worries believe wollay make game truly envisions give us leveling system please itll make game actually decent way gets super old super early go back alpha dont buy editdont buy still supportnews devs look guides theres mod fixes problems beta version alpha didnt wollay pixie might want consider outside help would make neutral review community dont think devs deserve support aka paid product actually give support news change community would agree needs changed back originally go download alpha version game free online game much better experience go get crack alpha much better trainwreck go play project hedra instead cube world alpha feeling dev cares opinion responsive god awful recommend c god really wish could recommend game state cant let state one early alpha players game much changed hoping praying wollay would deliver something incredible life times heard cubeworld released steam less lot us freaked finally could go back playing cubeworld better cubeworld got feels like shell shell used basics unnecessary additions slapped called day cannot recommend game current state region locking dumb equipment locking dumb new skill system worse active skills passive class skill skills effected ability explore fact generating world around us like climbing swimming hang gliding sailing even boats hang gliders region locked making collecting anything seem pointless cant even call rpg theres levelling skill points reason help anyone except equipment works one area buy game full price wait gets better god damn dev released game got moneys disappeared like years ago dont put hopes bottomless pit game gonna short sweet review yes lot things could improved game lot hope course perfect pretty fun game regardless havent played friends quite yet id imagine compared singleplayer playing friends makes experience better know everyones complaining region locking lack exp far dont mind theres much content individual area think region locking may actually make game enjoyable know im minority really like time start new areas questing line start beginning know compared rpgs little odd think creative way allow hours fun rather reaching endgame quickly defeating everything matter seconds much hope future game think wollay able make cube world something great good game bad devplease keep updating know wont remove region locking make artifacts give actual buffsallow steam workshop mods people dont rely moddersmake game cheaper u keeping samei loved game first day nothing wrong itbut got point move regions didnt want since went mage already op didnt enjoy classes never touched good game fun challenging issues gear working outside region madelooted fun coop experience good game friends spent hours friend hoping content comeworks device without problems good game like drama around region locked stuff makes laughholds found memories good enough expected lot six years wasnt big fan game enjoyed watching people play back day time forgot really big part playing almost completely new start exploring different creatures region like bunnies getting beat death later pretty fancy regions unique items help unlock dungeons discover treasures special places pretty cool also quests get talking strangers randomly discovering quests location exploring worldon hand tedious rules like resetting inventory cross border get another region forcing search basic important items boat glider real way progress region whats far quests actually either kill boss save person monsters resists waves arena dont gain level killing mobs completing missions level collecting artifacts missions twice even three progress wasnt saved reason got lot gold almost value completed least one region wont worry gain pay unless spend traveling ocean incredibly empty look see sand seaweed night incredibly dark barely even see whats front always pay gold coins make daytime blind feel night resume game bad repetitive empty get tiring im playing friend recommend decided buy anyway know playing friends always makes things better cant imagine playing alone would play maximum around hours still regions play missions finish dont expect play good first impressions however would suggest removeoverhaul region locking systems people want feel like theyre consistently progressing adventuring feel like theyre punished bring back skill trees lessen confusion people experience helping sense progression also adding growth make pets useful less allow people gain killing normal creatures happen utilisation mentioned skill tree additionthat said game great potential look forward seeing fixes made make enjoyable used good foundation unbelievably different terms scope charm beta wollay locked echo chamber created something one wanted good game fun play bad sucks good game mmo action rpg clone apparently want like crisp minimalistic art style although splashes colour might hurtthat end game obviously design decision exploreconquer every zone want hop leave anytimeyou want play friends go new zone start power level instead one low level guy feeling useless got drive kid soccer training split buddies continue zone pick exactly left good game nice good game worth wait good game lot potential theres still hope teased features make back game current state game really goodwhy couldntcant hire additional staff assist game beyond like nobody given money good game hard first discover core game play loop progression accelerated much fun friends varied party skill sets styles classes much hardereasier play solo everything viable balanced multiplayer party good game needs experience back remove region locked gear im fun game good game wish wasnt dropped good game thumbs feel accomplished play really put time get anywhere good lordfrankly hate mmoification thats hot trend late like certain games added crap wasnt needed im intruiged game takes mmo tropes baked genre minimalizes im keen endless treadmill

bonuses yeah start new province go back old one slap old kit roflstomp stuff wantfrankly like means new province fresh new adventure need use cunning guile avoid getting crushed means new province accessible buddy started playing hours game may agree perhaps rush everincreasing numbers doubtless thousands games cater urge wish happiness playing one closer like worth asking price friends play good hopefully get better time goes good openended exploration rpg interesting system progression thats fun grind traverse good far already want reset gear since found legendary sword im overpowered dtrying finish everything first area move next one reset gear challenge cool first stage almost gear would great gear progression system instead legendary random drop instantly overpowers playerso spent time playing game say game pretty cool region lock actually great thing mountgliderboat allows partially skip new location without proper exploration something dealt region lock helped resolve issue another thing even would keep gear new location harder keep interest challenging would shit new zone precious shiny gear whats pointalso region lock resolves endless leveling issue ie would like game definitely requires another perspective different expect regular rpg need rush game explore slowly good without mods great mods little slow early got hooked hours first days id keep playing feel like ive seen everything game offer see problem removal xp levelling regionlocked combatspecial items however regionlocked mobility items serve purpose getting riding speed increased hours artifact hunting think id like able ride pet upon entering new region without find item levels currently nothing indicator artifacts foundb artifacts give small increases mobility stats permanent progression

enjoying game much finding new things every daythanks great game great game everyone posting negative comments people waiting years dissapointed game doesnt everything theyve ever wanted solid game could play hundreds hours artifacts need grant better stats equipment allowed everywhere rather neighboring land great game exploring fun although hindered progression system tweaks would insanely

game even better old version congrets great game would recommend anyone great game love exploration always something around corner great game childhood best game ever definitely recommend everyone great potential minimal communication mediocre best release version better wait buy grinding artifacts one unrewarding things ive ever experienced rpg potential alpha sadly lot others ive read disappointed game even waiting years hope wollay least consider making changes progression larger questlines game stands sadly wont able enjoy game sidenote unrelated gameplay soundtrack complete feelinglooks game still wonderful guys come first day allow da yute know wollay trying encouraging adventuring making sure u go regions actually exploring back alpha sometimes u skipped region level restrictions world generation got really repetitive new region lock system isnt perfect need improvements feel like know wollay trying keeping open mind far fun friends defeating good region sense accomplishment people dont like change especially unexpected sudden ones asked update finally got one aint perfect hey something new hopefully wollay look shit get affected comments criticism im hoping look find stuff improve also create game envisions havent played much know gotta keep open mind im glad finally got update man aight im outtie cube world boiiiis leeeets gooo high hopes years bombarded negativity make made lower standards wollay really deserves credit still good game flaws people blowing flaws water much hate directed towards wollay get things need change people want whole game basically change reverted back alpha disagree spent hours playing game game two days im addicted sure dont level way use leveling means less kinda game presistant bastard likes know spend enough time one save able move like maniac since leveling boosts basically move stats randomly get artifacts yes wish introduced back sort leveling system via fighting makes fighting worth keeping new leveling system calling something else yes game rng element loot wise seriously rpgs dont get keep gear always meaning cant thomp enemies get lucky move different region thats apart fun people want able keep gear region region possible current system means got lucky star weapon example could trash new region come across making game quickly boring easy yes know theres alot scrubs like easy game come grow learn way rpg grind grind grind dont like grinding even playing review gonna look like bunch nonsense put one post works cant describe disappointed hate yes game needs changing extent people saying want wollay disappear another years tweaks game calm yo shit wait put imput game deserves praise hatred going negative review least critical year old complaining stupid shitlastly heres small list things like things think need changingthings likeartifacts change something current system wouldnt scrape item regional artifacts would ulter slightly suggestion would give artifacts raritys thiswhite region green centre region surrounding regions blue centre region region distance centre region purple minor permanent buff weak varient artifact gets replaced stronger varients example say get purple boat every region get boat unlocked sure weaker boat works better swimming also gets replaced stronger varients example get blue one replaces stronger leave range blue one get purple one back finally yellowgold rarity normal strength artifact permanent every cant get replaced either equal stronger varients super super rare getalso make artifacts less common harder get finding randomlyheres idea could changedyellow examples chances using format chancei like kingdoms idea would like see expanded oni like combat though wish fights varied enemiessecrets gotta love secret loot rarer average loot higher chances betterthings dislike need changeleveling system needs tweaks add multiple different things level progress growth funglider flies slightly differently alpha imo right worseone best parts ocean could go breath fight enemies suggestion make artifact spawns ocean regions allows breath underwater also add enemies water would nicespoilers shown never ended release wollay could least warn us whats scraped whats still works one want giant ass citieswhy bush break drop star item lolanyways havent listed everything new game much game im yet experience everything excited keep playing even planning making youtube series game dont care im one others sad games state ill still enjoy thats main goalalso wasnt planning allowing comments fkc want expand ideas game comment away want hate wollay dont bother wasting time ill ignore one favourite things coming things games even never get addededit sadly creator game couldnt handle feedback community disappeared face earth im going consider game dead reccomend game either gets worked b major issues game fixed abandon something worked years life run away little hate kinda makes weak need learn take feedback honestly sending suggestions feedback ignoring hate blast alpha good bit fun version multiplayer isnt buggy graphics pleasing eye gameplay mechanics fun however enter new zone like starting game againdue random nature drops get either grind hours make zero progress kill one enemy get four five star weapon trivializing content zoneit generally fun enemies mages greatly tuned cant really recommend game would love love early game doesnt feel good every hours youre thrust back given option similar progression system alpha six years ago would happily flip review would love explore biomes alas dont ten hours grind every zone look steam library today looking revisit old games quickly stumbled upon game againthis game example happens quality assurance kind game developer access large community players already payed play alpha version dying play working years utilized player base already wouldve built game community side would undoubtedly made better product refinement expansion alpha got years ago went viral imagine playing demo first hours new rpg youre looking forward developers go completely dark develop game least hope developing still get drip fed information maybe screenshot every months suddenly stripped experience points equipment find gets taken away whenever leave area thats developer treated fans get hands alpha build somehow good luck great time group friends despite lacking features please support game unless miracle developer gets head ass heavy reworks game buy lot fun playing game like others find regions annoying artifacts useless would really like see better progression system similar alpha high hopes bought refunded fast feels like worse realesed steam would recommend hopes high steam release months devs gone like years ago still much potential dont care improveupdate whats point modding community hope game actually enjoyable hadnt chance play alpha minireview serves comparison versions hopefully better objectiveonce get grip play game properly charged attacks skill usage haste class abilities enjoy lot thanks huge factor immersion exploration thus quite addictive wander around look counter however agree less reviewers much potential lot things need fixedimproved im looking forward future updatesdont let negative especially toxic reception fool game nonetheless good technically gameplaywise hard pass youre completionist wants nothing search every nook cranny every single zone guess itd fun enough youre press every button find key goodif youre expecting rpg ability explore pace absolutely youre lot potential good game needs longevity overall progression zones becomes bit staleadd overall progression add unique biomes take inspiration terraria aspect large dungeons big raid bosses nottldr base gameplay good needs give players reason explore environments explore good ideas poorly executed massive potential improved gotta thumbs practically none features shown since alpha including faction quests new quest types grand cities improved ai new classes even stripped back features ui elements skills parties addition widely criticised region lock system gear including mounts become useless next regioncouldnt recommend current price feels bare bones alpha promise needs improvement right understand developer going doesnt work well hope project continues much potential executed poorly isnt fair consumers try deal developer prone disappearing would recommend purchasing game current state game update since release dev really put unpolished game capacity completely ignore players bought first timers old vets better time never decided disliked game quickly spawn context clue anything usually fine reason game wrong almost like little even minimalist learning use crafting menu quickly came realize cant see half displayed information due appearing screen allowing move inventory crafting menus returning money back asap ever played game really loved looked played video actually played experience intrusive felt pity game way feel cube world really wanted like progression feels restrictive hope developers make game little user friendly time heck let gear transfer biomes feels bad lot fun friends gives

near future hello probably wont formal review would like give going give shot explaining want get cube worldwe start saying big fan alpha version locked away yearswith said fully capable putting behind order give game fair chance enjoymenthowever synopsis would alpha version cube world close masterpiece terms game design needed love attention regards adding content existing structure although would still happy cube world alpha simply reintroduced steam instead total rework game nowthis version cube world turned classic grindlootexplore game purely exploration grind even fails reward players exploring actual progression mechanics cube world labeled rpg misleading actual gameplay experiencewith mind partial fan exploration grinding games mans sky provided okay experience yearly updates followed release game nms could level gear obtain better ways things much like leveling rpg despite goal upgrades purely means getting upgrades quicker peakin current version cube world work way zero hero hours depending class seeing classes imbalanced however peak gear enter next region next nothing square one leads grind gear essentially lost previous region get level sense real progression always hitting gear cap course get gear called gear stays regions directly around region found gear although isnt progression isnt going anything get region little quicker said getting regions unrewarding get artifacts give bonus swimming light radius etc nothing actual value softhard cap reduces scaling even morecurrently also huge variety quests game well wouldnt huge problem werent case mini encounters entire content game nowits safe say version cube world lifespan many hours gameplay enjoy would put hours generouswith mind lets talk alpha version cube world available download purchase anymore legal practicesin alpha version cube world world explore character build gear gloryto start alpha leveling came getting experience points pet upon killing enemies stronger enemy experience would get taking also incentivised combat actually fighting enemies leveled gain power increase buffed base stats little allowed wear higher tiered gear locked away power level gear locked behind power levels allowed steady ramp progression almost never ended gear could find scaled permanently level allowing infinite progression chose play long one character becoming stronger level world leveled would see enemies locations get even stronger explored said enemy scaling also infinite engaging always fun play againston top leveling skill tree expanded upon gave skill points use combat non combat skills allowed people played class able specialize unique experiencethere much said missing current version alpha perhaps add onto review ever decide develop proper list things werecould beenwith said current version cube world well deserved still semiplayable dedicated fan pure exploration rpg games didnt know alpha existedalthough generally lost faith developers game perhaps one day right thing deliver us cube world loved heres recommendation help fight haters cube world different bad still quite like different like grown something hey wolly hope updates class skills skills dynamic game skills alpha actually cool maybe get another idea waited years hope thats im patiently waiting uptadesbest luck love wolly hey guysfirst never played alpha played via steam familiy sharingi must say game really awesomei like grafiphics style adventure like feelingbut actually found glich exploit wanted point outwhen dual wielding upgrade first weapon onceafter try taking

working gamethere cause lot critics cube world launched even game atm good game hey years silent actually get play cube world ill honest enjoyed iteven though recommended cube world im saying game didnt flaw big one well let go good thing found first environment great everything look lively colorful making exploring alone fun enjoyable game greatly present exploring explore stronger become doesnt mean would become overpower explore zone adaptive game become cant use gear another zone including plus gear course need explore want get stronger allow explore even terrain artifact interesting actually level need explore gathering much information possible locate artifact artifact concept act like treasure hunt rather progressionnow done pros flaws game unbalance start game die lot monster actually one shot get close fighting range enemy first feel like hell especially mages move strong hell challenge strong enemy first stand chance get rarer gear get much powerful go even unbalance skills actually hella broken example ranger scout subclass ultimate quicksands strong move slow enemy let take damage hilariously low cooldown seconds cooldown actually start activate ability disappear actually beat level melee boss starter gear abusing skill cheating game lacking motivation get stronger gear become powerful zone change area gear immediately become useless weaker level gear zone seeing people get discourage exploring play area theyre bored stop playing artifact even fun find still doesnt enough impact make people think exploring important biggest flaws game repetitive difference repetitive replayable cube world lean repetitive rather replayable time explore different area different experience make gear fight something get better gear get best gear beat dungeons quest area get information artifact change area everytime yes something different time main thing always samelooking review may think game isnt fun need try game may miss progression motivation game enjoyable everything pros blend together perfectly little love care game clearly masterpiece hey maybe another man sky fiasco know conclusion game may best cannot find experience like anymore may enjoy doesnt stop game fun encourage everyone pick game try enjoy great well leave review hey pretty good still pretty good heyremove region lock add levelsskill tree much better start ofim fun tho hi guys another review hereoverall like many gameplay features dont get wrong combat kind fun exploring fun crafting basic might funwhat complete kicks game progression system soon leave current area county gear besides gear gets useless matter epic supergear ago looted boss received quest crafted absurd price gets rolled starting gear statsso really tried like game current state fun overall collecting hours shrooms buy gem rare gem per shroom craft rare item needs four gems get quest outside current area unable use progression system name states lock regionlock system splits cubeworld less x x amount countries small grinding games look hi two centsi played alpha back day periodically since games harness infinite resources progression grab attention enjoy spending hours repeating actions processes game enjoyed alpha betathis game brutal unfriendly new players watched someone youtube play first time game made sense lucky prior experience makes first hours bearable tend get angry capacity likely hate game confusion powerlessness youll start gets better could defeat regions weakest boss fourth hour point feeling genuine excitement exploring world hour six amassed entire inventory gold purple armor highest tiers failing defeat last boss feeling weak decided would travel new region armor weapons except amulet became worthless despite popular experience still fun virtually restarting agree wollay game best exploration focus currently artifacts ruins provide player combat advantage love searching goal conquer regions become strongest ever also read essay type negative reviews fail explain items properly items pieces gear work one region hard find grind bosses first region one village found even sold two items fun idea quest legendary gold item toooverall recommend game seriously read comments style cube world niche requires bit patience choose another game respectable developer twenty dollars kill enjoy spending long hours exploring may worth money hi normally write game reviews reason hate popular actual fair comparison current version alpha seriously guys loving hate game seem remember alpha seriously ridiculous toxic screaming fair criticismsskill treethe skill tree seems top complaint game alpha unlocked basic features using boat riding pet grinding hours upon hours gain levels repetitive killing lower levels mobs wollay took right turn transformed small simple quests much faster fun yes region locked great forces travel around since gold transfers regions simply find flight master teleport near quests unlock boats animal riding handglides etc opinion region locking could better weapons armor locked different biomes rather borders lands still right change skill treeswalkinganother complaint got better alpha walking game know reviewers fell well cannot remember pain staking time would take player go one region next especially lower level riding boat handglide wanting excuse hate game guaranteed much much less walking gameother quickiesthe region locking also makes much fun play friends find high level gear weapons satisfying go back highlevel mobs go town pets much fun find switch feelthere defiantly faults overshadowed great improvements gameconclusionpeople need break mob mentality think alpha game compare fairly yes wollay bad communicating remember working game probably time wife job dream game thinking working game together creating new races mechanics makes happy brings best game want game made corporation go ahead find hereps perfect game mind greatly disappointed go ahead make im sure could better free time im sure medical emergency break fans totally understanding lack communication like community high expectations lead long fallsits bad feels better alpha build thought would become laying around sure buy funyou want creative open world roleplaying game play otherswait hytale play wow dunno probably games minecraft highkey ever good mods hip squarethere charming visuals chill music pets collect dungeons conquer various quests long awaited fans update promised cube world great quest system selection character play styles new worlds overall polished game deliverin many ways version improved initial launch added music quests fast traveling viable way craft armor weapons effective money system buy items beautiful new landscapes well special items earn loot definite things hold game back however include character customizationprogression lack information worlds poor lore ill talk region locked items players obtain weapons gear good power single area unless items bad seems first strange feel powerful one area helpless next encourages keep hunting weapons gear well explore beautiful scenery time playing game trying find gear random enemies disappointed get items cannot use classes random drops favor give class quests however almost always got useful item money obtained said quests buy gear villages even buy materials gnomes complete quests let craft gear cube world robust way players play around region locked gear real problem however region locked transportation items want sail glide ride around area already partially explored said area counter productive exploration character progression fun general would like see items move purchased shop permanent inventories future updatethe region locked transportation also negative character progression riding one noticeable stats level game even something players time update expand skill trees instead gave players skills right gate figure use still class specialization though provides play variety arguably good combat level feels underwhelming previous mentioned region locked exploring items minor miscellaneous skills minor complaint update promised new character races addition original play none also game would benefit vanity slot keep cool looking gear whole timefor issues information tutorial new players get feel controls fact night really fun always stay inn till dawn really need night game stands make layers go back town game would also benefit region completion percentage well way reliably missing areas marked level need beat dungeons dungeons mostly underground making hard spot map right npcs randomly tell cool stuff would like see dedicated information dealer sell information probably higher price high tier informationand finally world lore boring feel like fits world lore pedestals sometimes mark important areas map enough sadly lore collection stories world factionsraces collect read journal enjoy whenever mark progression probably ball mark unfortunately game right arguably still beta version creator hinted future updates possibly basehouse buildingso sum everything game fun little hollow roadblocks player exploration new players want outside guide tips fixes mentioned presented easy hoes madunpopular gaming opinion game pretty cool hoes mad homeboy dipped want recommend cant honest review game lacking different ways lack leveling system hard handle gear region locked kinda sucks gear could transfered upgraded like boss system regions conquered become merged location played alpha beta steam release game still incredible truly recommend comparing alpha isnt fair game honestly enjoyed beginning game could use like little bit progression changes update something hopefully love game honestly bought rated positively many great hours playing alfa back daythe game still playble like times less playble honestly dont see game receiving much hate played little bit back alpha always enjoyed game feel bit different like direction hes taking still isnt much tutorial guide play thoughmy biggest peeves game multiplayer doesnt well unless parties great internet finicky region region lose progress youve made essentially okay dont mind restarting looking new weapons everywhere pve essentially grinding feels way hard bit lacking skill possible outskill mobs extremely hard especially multiplayer theres even tiny bit latency honestly dont understand huge amount hate people giving current state game personally dont find bad yes region locking little annoying much makes want unleash rage suns couple things could change would definitely help game gliders boats reigns perm items least way make perm wouldnt something make perm immediately something make perm work ex acquire certain item craft complete x amount regions like boat could region glider reigns something like another thing could gear switching regions gear could go stars rank something instead becoming super weak starter items chooses random rank purple artifacts also need something give passive barely noticable buffs maybe artifacts gives damage buff somethingthose ideas something friend thought personally like idea think could work well another thing people said alpha way better current version every way dont think loved alpha bit current state game gives dungeons lot better alpha fun little bit something would play hours like people think game fine could use couple changes think people need calm stop raging like family got destroyed honestly really enjoy hard learn first lot tutorials youtube watching tutorials game able learn pretty quick address big part leveling yeah might like normal rpg xp instead level artifacts still fun play dont need xp make rpg fun yes might make rpg games cube world still fun xp also region locked gear say hard find gear dont need gear start new zone like starting adventure fun starting also version coop much easier able play friends yet seems fun ok back gear clearing regions able get nice gear probably get blue weapon second third zone lot pieces armor set zones normally get atleast green rating armor fun play changed lot still fun honestly blast first couple hours playing game playing false assumption game still beta point game huge balancing problems punishes trying explore things youre done first region really stupid region lock system point game worth would pay game really fun game complete first region fun stops might well make new character honestly better trying go region lock system even region lock system removed might get another hours honestly game doesnt much many obvious features already game even present alphaso unless game receives huge updates fixes gameplay either wait go sale really good price dont bother modders might able save game fixing problems adding features eventually thatll take honestly super excited games release last year sitting library uninstalled tried long convince game good honestly better people make still worth euros dollars honestly cube world really fun game artifacts pain acquire arent really worth find good gear makes region youre breeze would recommend even setback whole region locking thing going game gets way better whole group people new regions feel less tedious honestly recommend pirate alpha version game includes playtime replay ability far fun shit removed full release stop supporting woolay updated game settle bare minimum yes know hours low invalidate point warning alt hours decide want refund honestly dont know im fun constant exploration trying die everything funny way enjoy casual gaming man running around without single care thats friends even better actual story takes time understand world large need find clues shit convoluted fun ps tutorial fun figuering everything lmao honestly like version honestly im writing review finish game awards honesty game isnt bad youll get good hours gameplay starts get little repetitive happens get friends help keep interesting dunno know might update later real thoughts game one day honestly im pretty disappointed enjoy alpha lot moreits worth money opinion honestly kills give game negative review waited long let start saying game really like alpha remember back day waiting got home play could run around fly explore amazing game today bought game opened wasnt anything like remembered game feels really hollow magic gone honestly one disappointing games region locking second worst addition game right removal talent trees alpha fun although lacked story end goal fact id say large portion fun running around aimlessly addition quests feels like way try say added something game really limit honestly really love game polish put im happy see releasedhowever game total downgrade promised initially im severely disappointed see happenthe multiplayer feature something say absolute improvement leastthere major improvements could make game better lessen region locking make tools like boat permanent theres sense actual progression everything reset noticeably smaller regions steam achievements badges improve level scaling im getting jumped enemies trying mana tree quest add beastiary quest log understanding enemy improve qol knowing youre going vital cosmetics characters building oceans need drastic improvement theres water mobs seem spawn land often underwater give tailor carpenter npcs actual use otherwise theyre show listen reviews readd skills xp lot combat borderline boring moves especially berserker warrior sit hold button enemies due rage healing damage takethe weapon modification game really good id love see similar level voxel editing things furniture clothing maybe steam workshop supportas game stands okay good could wish launched early access least know isnt final releaseif game would transparent development last years feel community feedback would made game far better upon release honestly game good old cube world people years ago salty little things play fun honestly cant reccomend game current state exp system skill trees removed way level go artifact hunting nothing stats artifacts merely increase speeds climbingswimmingmounted speed even range lantern lights monsters rarity like equipment however long dont equipment youll able kill white named mobs even time possibly needing heal afterwards dont gear forget trying go anything doesnt white names youll get decimated region locked equipment kills exploration may want whereas alpha would mostly exploring going rather linear path new system makes unless bother going clearing entire zone going process getting item drops items quit current zone probably bluepurple even orange gear morph trash gray equipment effectively resetting back boats gliders also afflicted system gear way keep gear outside original area skills basically overwatchlike got two class specific skills ult depending class spec recommend cube world ive lot fun time alpha beta maybe fixed ill recommend stands youd better playing trove even wynncraft server minecraft better alternatives imo honestly enjoyed game lot dont mind start scratch every ive farming gear dont worry weapons thats armor farm maybe get lucky later items anyone doesnt know use region sure many people hating definitely great game opinion honestly like new system regionlocking agree peoples criticisms however current problems like fixed doubt game fun long progression made rewarding possible feeling well experience weve waited cube world honestly really wanted like game purchased alpha build back excited see wollay releasing game steam started playing realized lot things experience changed im going list basically different game trivial mechanics kept first really liked new cube world like need talk npcs find things also like new uii several problems game however dislike abilities unlocked start ability tree new gearbased progression doesnt bother would like traditional leveling back support ability tree nothing else ability tree alpha made need think skills would need put points whatnot besides problems also lot fun regardless decided travel next biome however hugely disappointed gear region locked stopped playing felt like beaten game already sense didnt want beat overall first biome experience really good wish maybe instead needing start next biome experience spread would like experience progression whole map one biome makes sense dont mind find items long dont need find many times honestly would recommend cube world current state might fun maybe hour friend lacking content quickly put end fun game creates illusion giant map explore different biomes reality spend time one single region due region locks travel another biomeregion pretty much items acquired previous region useless completed one region youre gonna lose items move new region might aswell create new character try new class instead personal opinion region locking needs removed content weaponequipment tiers exploration dont spend running around empty fields nothing enemies occasional group npcs quest sadly one games really hyped years ago really really want like impossible current state honestly ima remain optimistic believe game could get better lack skill tree regionlocked gear kinda annoying doesnt feel rewarding used run problems inventory screens clipping side monitor example checking one shops couldnt see much items cost prices border screen even tried changing resolution see help sadly didnt another problem prevalent blue fog im sure reason whenever die try go different area fog doesnt want dissipate tried changing render distance didnt help end day cant really much hope review help dev players dont recommend getting game suggest wait updates want buy dont let review stop good game state honestly would recommend game without second thought wasnt bugged like right today main core mechanic game artifacts bugged work properly effect half registered making whole thing pointless devs completely disappeared right release leaving us defective productwhile many people complaint game different expected reaction wich disagree real issue behavior devs actually change review positive one soon bugfix confirmed ever happens honestly even little bit worthy news since game released would probably lean towards recommending seems like abandoned honestly one best games ever played gutted wollay lord saviour disappeared wait definitely worth masterpiece childhood come back bigger better colours couldnt recommend game solo relaxing experience fun bash friends voxel graphics make beautiful canvas adventure wish new dynamic music transports cube world loved game since alpha still love nowthank shaping childhood wollay youre legend honestly pls make like alpha honestly game feels like late stage concept build game much potential isnt lot regards sadly cant recommend honestly let long game development dosnt represent pacing game isnt good overall game feels empty really wanted enjoy game understand dev personal issues deal still im surprised turned wanna love game hope updates make love honestly obviously alpha version anymore completely different game bad hell im lot fun playing understandable fans alpha mad didnt get game expected yes still doesnt make game badi recommend game bc im fun playing fun grind gear fun explore huge world fun play friends honestly isnt hoped much changed promised alpha much potential hundreds hours fun alpha long years regret say im disappointed feel like takes forever get anywhere especially early game monsters high level starting almost die single guy fact cant take equipment new regions weaker destroys whole aspect rpg get ridiculously strong crush everything feels like progression weapon customization still sick feature also see cant select different worlds like used finding special items creatures take literally forever seen positive negative rare therefore fun find since cant take new regions feels weak destroys whole enjoyment progression excitement back day alpha cannot unfortunately recommend game anymore honestlyits like forgot make game fungot got hype years ago waste money hoping pull nms hopes arent high steam release terrible region locked progression class design removal levelingtalent trees weapon customization crafting redundant buy current state refunded mine horrible concept exploration game horrible rework game functioned back open alpha lose practically progress punished exploring additionally nothing left region forced practically throw away progress made equipment doesnt carry regions reduces stats pretty much want sail across sea bad need go find boat region located somewhere middle lake mainland somewhere game also imbalanced open alpha almost time prepare dodges pretty much go cycle dodgeattackdodge monster dies every character built like glass cannon fast way get around even altars scattered around easy miss never directly near dungeons places likely die always near towns meaning cant warp back town identify pieces leftovers got like unidentified armours weapons mmo style game bring next glaring issue game get piece equipment one people party playing solo exact class effectively money spent money find useless better finding flat good equipment relying finding good equipment identifying leftovers around map find various resource deposits like ore wood silk give resources type however classes need types resources meaning lot gets sold given friends useless useful effectively wasted finally decided move next region really hoping game would releasing steam years opened alpha somehow years dev time teasing features devs blog posts twitter pretty much place game currently leaving watered version tons contradictory design flawsits openworld rpg punishes exploringtldr stay away decided remove counter intuitive systems make game full pointless busywork combats fun enough go play trove instead youd get trove day would week hot garbage compared alpha already disappeared glad got free since

people dont let years waiting go waste unbalanced gameplay good luck cant wait see game played game years ago quickly became one favorite games world small group friends travel fight dungeons excited skill trees coming soon building aspect coming soon infinite leveling coming soon fast forward today theres progression get gear lose talent trees levels building held hope checked subreddit years wish walley would never finished game least could think good game could released miss dream cubeworld played tons hours alpha even years last update tried new version honestly say whatda fuck release steam feels like getting fist crush face everything changed worst side wish get alphaversion back could play funny interesting cool cube world waited fucking yearsand dont care people saybut pls bring back exp leveling system absolutely adored alpha cube world sad development stopped years ago reason liked alpha rpg system could explore rewarded exploring exotic pets strange bosses new gear becoming stronger found game spent hours first tbhhowever cannot recommend game restrictive overbearing parent whatever want one region things turn least bad region size hold skyrim sometimes hours spent one region get another region get pet wanted wanted explore regions ended running happy weak butt back original region gear made impotent outside got nice star sword well grey weak sharp pool noodle leave original regionit weird obtuse system developer would kept building alpha game would mixed reviews today positive believe developer free whatever wants arent owed better alpha cube world im asking one whatever wants however make product sell keep audience mindi almost guarantee large portion didnt recommend game loved cube world alpha going silent years plopping game feet running fear criticism unfortunate agree people act entitled agree people take comments far invalidate criticism merits absolutely love game every single way except one small thing within last year development developer overhauled way progress game currently stands becomes significantly boring complete first couple biomesregions probably max unless dev changes improves get max gameplay depending playing friends becomes boring repetitive want die yet despite every detail game love would still say game amazing buy absolutely love game alpha really enjoyed way game turned beta new quest system great absolutely love way implemented gamea lot people seem complain new region locking honestly dont think bad everybody makes fact really liked keeps gameplay goining encourages player get appropriate gear artifacts previousy leveled stayed overpowerd rest game still enjoy game discover new thingsthis way creates new challenges time enter new regionthis game gorgeous pixely graphics lovely sounds music feature love probably newly added quests taming systemi think game amazing everyone loves good adventure game absolutely loved cube world alpha spend countless hours playing even though never received updates held hope two full years wollay would come back four years later heard game coming actually genuinely hyped im distraught learn unfathomable reason removed good parts game wish hed revert start wholeheartedly dissapointed absolutely loved game back day done removing mmorpg part game vital made game fun something simple leveling region locking gear start different region im utmost happy game came disappointed way seems game pushed back features rather pushed forward hope future updates may fix anyway thank coming back please bring back game loved actually dont know think gamesometimes amusing also times feels empty running simulatorshould fun lot friends though actually lot fun playing game progression pretty smooth first region minor jumps difficulty region locking system isnt even harmful progression farming enough get items take next region however reward beating dungeon needs much greater currently right beating entire dungeon likely require game days farming yellow gear crafting buff potions gives artifacts increase stats like climbingswimming speed small amount fix would either make artifacts increase stats actually matter like healthattackdefense dungeon boss always drop item class use editoriginally posted review went new region still thought would easy progress get back however spending time region realized broken unfun progression really quest ride pet cant use glider keep mobility starting every region go process getting one shot every enemy exists besides select objectively boringyou cant even use coins got previous region speed progression good items locked behind quest cant dont good items essentially feels like progress spend hours previous region doesnt exist better starting new character region least experience different class admire coming back finish appreciate struggles gone bring game lifebut game ultimately combat combat isnt fun game exploration map already unlocked already know biomes expect across horizon game feels like community left development long unable point design ideas arent fun ultimately improve game meaningful waywhich basically happened hereit made passion lovebut sadly doesnt mean good agree game bit lacking contentwise hoping comeback similar certain game space explorationfor moment quite enjoy gamefarming tedious biomes tend know progress quickly blast gamethis game ways challenging pick fights plan travels choose youll go guess youll get efficiency exploration keyscuriosity driving try get many artifacts possible wonder cap exists end game bonuses able cross biome speed sound able light half world lanternthere one way find outthe adventure beginning agree lot criticism surrounding game losing key items like boat glider seems counter productive however game still fun explore plus items system great way continue adventure without completely restarting forcing vary build say low amount info things like relics work slightly annoying though fan new changes unlike get group friends fun youve long time fan replayibility live version loved alpha got high levels thing left game explore procedurally generated world fear enemies alpha outscaled enemies game ended lonely god endless world contrast live version forced play biome intelligently try max gear fight artifacts im hours yet explore ice lava biomes yet though look forward generally think praise alpha game totally misplaced tell even alpha version leveling tweaked scaling game always bound put ceiling difficulty enemies said endgame always bound unfun replayability always important factor game built around procedural generation things id like hope variety added game expand upon already high replayability believe design philosophy think could made better variety distinct dungeons variety types rooms found current dungeons classes class specializations would also nice addition fanboy game waited years game thing say alpha betterand thats sad like hey switched area forest forest start gear completely useless every single time switch area could lived would boat glider every piece gear also bugs alpha like hp bars arent syncing oni like idea game acutall state say dont buy actually someone tried play begins like first base menu go start game create character pop world goodbeside idea control thing youre lucky enough like youll spawn huge tree something character creation could go wrong due lightthen may wander around like hour finding something thats utterly useless continue buy better sword bow smth youll get oneshoted bumblebees ogres dwarf hunters bugs list goes onthen make quests new first time okay sounds fun enough really first time since repetitivetalk repetitive personally got bored one biome game really seem suggest explore well since gear reset area point quests one area theres way beside bad yet exquisite equipmentmy final thoughts hoped would good moment enjoyable thrilled really game doesnt feel rewarding although hope much get updated become better many ways also one alpha players back day big proponent new changes system many arbitrary features xp talents gear became arbitrary time went playing many regions new system feels like replayability higher im saying isnt room improvement foundation place update gives wollay much better base improve upon get another update isit seems divided community largely stems fact game different alpha version whether like update anyone expected coming release fact took six years changes also little underwhelming overall would still highly recommend game friends im blast please take reviews grain salt concerned games future imo orignal game seemed polished version still tutorial guide insturctions ever open menu scroll controls new player og would hard time play seems spawn enemies super high level sometimes towns middle nowhere insutruction walk idk happened skills seems radically different definetly improvements awesome additions another great thing steam sum full release ea going shitstorm lot true fans sad disappointed sad first real review made steam sad recommending game others really loved alpha played months released enjoy game changes promised least teased tweets things expecting homerun success game feels like corpse alpha hollow shell game already looking bit meek alpha hooked start even though called meek enough fun enjoyable changes made good improve game lot doesnt feel like cube world know review bit late busy college remembered game winter break happy wollay releases update eating words would change review heartbeat game fell love six years ago enjoying itthings took time adjusting lack basic tooltips left missing key features happened mistake find self coming back game almost dailyregion locking concerned first actually fine really different moving new zone enemies harder current gear fact money special gear carry make bit easier main issue losing transportation items hurts worse new gear grind gameplay really spent time warrior rhythm found class pretty rewarding simple major complex action game engaging movement feels fun tools get like hangglider make getting around interesting really complaint want skills combat see much potential themgear actually love loot treadmills restarting zone feels good really need help new region go back one maxed grind money get good head start adding cubes weapons weirdly fun pets also fun track downside gear straight stats nothing really unique seems pop least didnt seem exploration world unique beauty chance finding random dungeonlootquest didnt see map makes exploring actually fun within region quests basic give enough motivation push forward think region locking actually helps push fully exploring area rather checking major land marks moving get hang gliding boat others really help enrich exploration losing new zone physically slows game much artifacts seem like perma bonuses find fairly lackluster increased small lamp light swimming speed non combat related perks arent terrible feel anticlimatic seem like perfect thing improved add new skills improve skills improve pets anything interesting moment tldr pros pretty game engaging exploration addictive loot grind simple fun gameplay pet animals cons loss exploration tools big drawback regionlocking skillartifacts feel lacking almost guidetips read wikis think pros outweigh cons know getting hopefully dev adjusts things make even better without sacrificing want game enjoying game far glad finally able play believe lot negative reviews people played alpha dislike changes made development maybe expecting triplea game waited long think changes made improve game greatly see people dislike items working specific region think keeps game interesting rather getting best gear unable die make new character game amazing consider price size development team plenty games full tens millions dollar budgets teams hundreds people turn terrible developers amazing job far excited see gameoverall would like people know yes lot changed believe theres better framework future updates imagine devs wanted release something long rather wait longer work updates infinitely long process game like extremely dissapointed title alpha kinda promising roadmap also satisfying nonetheless years wait developer decided drop vision realize something else majority seems unpleased decision ia broken progression system simplfied rpg elements almost nothing left enjoy looks like developer went back silence fairly glad never deleted alpha pcplaying alpha right im lot fun playing thatwollay went wrong think changes good get trapped kind echo chamberwith people affraid giving real feedback worried youd go back hidey hole glad back really miss skill tree going request refund chance get game changes great time exploring game see putting many hours love look feel difficulty fun get around though figure things bad exploration great would recommend game enjoy good exploration game bit actionedit hours still ton fun love exploring zone hunting gear help next zone awesome time cube world bought game alpha stage years back find release version far enjoyable extending play innovations levelling process make feel far invested home zones important infinitely procedurally generated map otherwise overwhelming prospect gear within zone become powerful enough take artefact guardians found challenging exciting boss

one many got game alpha state absolutely loved game enjoyed graphic style leveling system skill tree everything could think gamethe thing still love take consideration game developed two single souls many people may like region lock system get got confused first playing game full release state got absolutely oneshot everytime encountered enemy got used really enjoy game think region lock system good conductor adventureous explore find need find another thing find game much fun play friend consider getting game id recommend making another friend one get game play togetheri really recommend game give devs fighting chance good job guys keep good work posting review someone never played alpha years earlier please bear information incorrectafter six years development limbo due mental health issues described creator game nowdeleted blog post game inspired games runescape minecraft cube world finally lots changed past halfdecade list changes explanation old getting xp system ditched exchange region combat steep difficulty curve getting especially meleecentered classes warrior experienced breeze handle easy targets game asks explore region start dont go may look like mmo see players alas play steam friends theyre onlinein opinion game could still use work especially regionlocking mechanic still recommend aesthetics emphasis exploring voxel world built cubes somewhat enjoyable combat system playing friends recommended sure still breeze playing solo yes know plenty steam guides help tonthe game may rough start la mans sky reassure alpha players wait worth dont like thats fine argue theres always upcoming hytale people looking elsewhere really enjoying game chill fun cute region locked equipment unique feature emphasizes exploration grinding like biggest issue artifacts dont really seem worth maybe finding artifact gave slight boost base combat stats would worth would recommend game people prefer exploring large open world lots different biomes grinding powered possible blitzing dungeons still going recommend game undeniable issues format though hope updates get complete version game less confusing playable still enjoyable keeps feel alpha beta version feel complete allthe first issue noticed fish minor detail blow fish shore could run land something supposed part underwater biome dont believe quite mobile unless youre sea also experience fair amount lag sometimes would run flawlessly next moment would getting around fps alpha get lag game occasionally however still playable generally fine shortened render distance really point borderline unplayable game seems much graphics didnt notice new complex features added would cause additional lag im sure stems unless difference world generation thats another thing miss unending randomly generated biomes might make multiplayer complex keep feature hasnt stopped anyone playing minecraft friends dont like map fully laid decided removes fun could simply exploring biome lock also removes fun exploring certain ways think thered ways get around though changes game made considering description says supposed rpg focus exploration doesnt really feel waywithout skill tree system gaining weapons random drops makes beginning difficult youre weak compared everything else might get legendary weapon might get something around level already also makes harder feel like youre progressing guess im sure really making progress hard read understand biome lock extent however without skill trees random drops dont mesh well together think could keep biome lock changes elsewhere also miss spirit cubes funi still think game lot potential almost feels like another alpha beta update rather full release promised fingers crossed goes way mans sky becomes game everyone hoping updates edit ive gone back play alpha since lagging badly literally get onehit chicken im lucky still installed computer im fun alpha fun official release know problem thoroughly confused amount negative reviews loved cube world alpha love cube world even change equipment progression brilliant move wollay locking equipment region reason continue playing worried starting region things rollover coins material artifacts stay additionally rare gear use adjacent regions strikes perfect balance region reset region continuity amount content things bit staggering already spent hours game cleared regions biome enjoy rpgs especially indie rpgs actually contribute something new genre likely great game cant recommend game enough sad ended like many people waited game come ever since teaser gameplay first shown hyped however say dissapointed understatement gameplay barely evolved new endless system leveling character restarting progress every zone annoying mention buffs get completing dungeons minimal useless good moments lots bad must frustrating thing restarting progress every zone need new gear new weapon restarting level worst part getting transportation takes forever get necessary especially go island region way travel boat ai broken times things complain everyone elses review explains problems think creator good idea start shouldve released edit time didnt many mini changes creator changed core foundation game making something wouldnt bought knew end result backed game day one waited years followed creator twitter sign updates ate screenshots released cannot recommend game current state free alpha version game surprisingly better adjusted design choices made made really poor scaling game good backed game alpha quite surprised got game key try beta years later nice put quite bit time past week see cube world performs say wasnt beta early access release day big update many suspected cube world still lot potential still needs fleshing lot areas years development good enough fixed exp leveling weird self destructive way really benefits new system current state would recommend anyone buy game progression plain simple good worth time much better gaming experiences invest time feel good youve achieved cube world sadly one games shelve months revisit see worth playing yet believe trusting attitude patient attitude go hand hand see let go learn trust releases joy life trust youre able patient patience waiting something wait attitude waiting believe game really great potential personally wish way toggle different leveling systems loot becoming useless different regions mechanic also wish skill tree game could select abilities use class really like cube world bought cube world honestly find alpha fun solo player early game incredibly dull boring without friends beta initially fun opinion grows stale times regions significant meaningful long term progression whether quests gear leveling skill trees buy current state want play friends personally think would paid cube world current state length region exceeds two hours unable refund game decide youve enough one region sorry wollay really asked community input point past years dont make efforts improve game based community feedback lose entire fanbase quickly patience optimism runs dry bought cube world june enjoyed friends remember able barely run pc back thenin alpha version would play get endgame quickly easy outpace friends new design current release forces stop actually explore zones instead stopping smack boss around head next zone restricting gear regions kingdoms itemsim one region game atm im excited pick next region gold persistent regions kingdoms allows buy gear new towns slightly speed low gear lvl grindi comment server travel networking game pretty impressive seamless provides nice experience people coming goingill update press game friends overall nice release bought cube world alpha years ago pretty good update took long time come reasoning delay detailed picroma website regardless cube world still pretty good flaws see reading reviews still lot promise enjoyable play friends serious downside progression alpha levelbased leveled gained skills abilities addition gear increasing quality currently however everything zonebased regardless powerful one zone soon move weak couple exceptions still probably changed bought alpha years ago thinking would like alphasthe developer getting feedback players bug fixing improvements two patches first month minor bugs years interaction alpha players years later game released steam many fun things removed leveling skill trees removed player advancement gear region lock added game makes feel like starting time move new area game released devs gone silent blogs removed feels much like cash grab occurred years agocube world pretty much soured alphas early accessi never participated another one since fiascocash grabmy advice stay away one unless devs come back start putting time effort communication equation holding breath bought alpha years ago played enjoyed time cube worlds current state region locking recommend buying game lack rpg elements make terrible bought alpha years ago liked game finally released must say different still like really like graphical style look world etc game definitely better played friendsim sure future updates since heard anything creator bought alpha version back game wasnt steam even though didnt get updates felt like got moneys worthwith steam release us alpha players got full game free want money back bought alpha version played lot fun game missing things quests habilities powers bosses biomes structures overall great gamenow release steam say things time game region lock system long xp againyes game doenst xp upgrade level collecting almost usless artifactsso basically game biomes structures quests things like mobs lot pets essence cube world died lives alpha versionthe game stills fun cool play friends dowload mods add xp takes region lock system awesome mods easy download useif wanna buy game recommend download mods real experience bought alpha version many years ago way fun current version theres lot potential game fun leveling system insane fun play friend frustrating cant manage find friend play itunless updates game dud bought game knowing regionlock mod disabling regionlock personally like regionlock whatsoever think rather unnecessary regionlock theres existence creating different charactersclasses mind restarting various characters definitely sane regionlock regionlock aside game undeniably fun enjoyable compared first cube world version expansive new although hard get used system get going gameplay pleasant quite dungeons monsters npcs mechanics quite liked experience bought game years ago back alpha incomplete genuinely good time playing first impressions steam release far overall positive take little bit play around get used game find promising id love see community grow along continual updates bought game years ago friends wanted join never actually played followed anything dev released recently steam got key hopped online andi really enjoy ive seeingthen went online check things like pet foods found really angry community whose opinions seemed contradictory opinions game opinion really refreshing approach exploration leveling etc honestly really appreciate fact challenged learn new language playperhaps didnt know anything development dove see lot suggestions game needs improved cant help think would improve end result another levelgrinding mmo mean dont get wrong love well designed skill tree slow grind reach difficult terrain love kind game see cube world could adapted style maybe would wish well led along outset developmentcoming fresh eyes though many wonderful things game style world building mechanics keeping hooked besides still dev im excited see goes know im aware yalls frustration comes hopefully feel deep sense disappointment game changes back another direction shoes current critics lolz bought years ago lot fun im also lot fun changes people upset aboutim optimistic devs fine tune address complaints either way exceeded personal benchmark getting hour enjoyable gameplay dollar spentedit towards end launch day isnt peep devs much want love game wouldnt recommend purchasing proof developer stay time ill likely play little bit ive already alphakey friends lose interest honestly assumed would early access title apparently release bought game years ago wont lie like version lot good faith wollay think things get better bought game years ago first alpha enjoyed time however cant say reviews pretty much stated problem areas ones stand region locked equipment artifacts near useless even though theyre main objective game lack content combat game effectively useless start one shot every enemy aside white green named enemies lower level enemies drop negligible amount gold chance itemi racked enough gold buy armor beefed defenses slightly allowing take maybe one two hits lucky enough find legendary weapon may think happy find instead good time combat became unstoppable killing machine one shotting everything strategyat best game walking simulator youre either boot enemies youre godlike gear resetting every region including travel gear glider boat gives little incentive keep going complete first region youve pretty much experienced everything game offer difference moving new region vs starting new game small increase lantern boat speed artifact providesall im disappointed direction game taken recommend reading indepth reviews get full picture id also recommend looking thru wollays old twitter posts past years see features worked arent present release old roadmap former website good indicator much content could added gave lot hope taken favor new system bought game years ago alpha fun pointless every area takes away everything earn last area game worth money feels like worse idle game please dont buy right nowif still go log account download alpha play friends lot fun bought game years ago eagerly awaiting kind update unfortunately got something cant recommend spending money right bought game years ago changed lot since opinion changed better found new version enjoyable get first hour cant get new leveling system game isnt think worth try personally highly recommend game bought game years ago somehow original alpha state better gigantic pile shit wollay tried pass cube world way enjoy game community mods playing alpha version either way wollay still con man years ago vanished like avatar needed bought game around price years ago alpha came giving positive review think dollars well spent although probably find games give content bucks game likely give average player hours gameplay get bored run progressionrepetitiveness problems game currently bucks think hours game fun combat mechanics unique character abilities atmospheric environment cant find anywhere else trove doesnt nearly come close enough worth money however different everyone take said good game much entertainment game provides judge whether warrants price tag bought game back wish everyone could play gamei wish game developed slightly put everyone buy loved old game im sad game turned wish didnt post review game suckssss bought game back alpha stages development like lot peoplethe alpha beautiful demo amazing game despite systems simple concepts shown world created much potentialbeing little cube dude running around killing stuff getting stronger little direction brought back memories old days games nostalgiaand thats people angry built perception grand game going gifted future game would make feel way first major game didwe signed alpha alpha gotthis version cube world isnt bought back day still little game lot potentiali dont believe finished fun game fun friends short bursts dont believe expect grand game im pretty sure development team two people ffsi believe good run therei still get chills hearing music load game ill play alpha every oftenits bad game people expected bought game back first released standalone appreciate released new update assumed game entirely dead unfortunately game still plays though alpha developer chose completely change gameplay system feel actually made game worse always feel like new player arent progressing ive heard good things mods tried honestly hard little room improvement bought game back alpha available picroma site whatnot alpha fun good time exploring overall mechanics simply done maybe hours didnt friends wanted play thankfully isnt alpha great beta personallythe first treasure seeking hours almost bliss discover area youre lore game spawn points point cursor click teleport bunch neat utility equipment game lets whatever kind accomplishment decided go hop lava volcano top swam ocean little bit killed billion angry dogs whatever get essential zeldaesque utilitynow might asking hey next doesnt seem like im missing anything special equipment keys whats next yellow named area seems peculiar area might get artifact boosts one utilities minuscule margin would something truly complain thats next point game leaving area youre inyou might noticed kind drops symbol next region names saw stats nothing different rarity thus held value hope held onto kind region adjacent prove pieces equipment useful powerful equipment worth next nothing region aside origin well equipment useless utility area must sought thing truly get keep artifacts bonusesthis switch flipped people berserk mode tables got flipped go hours gameplay rinkydinky artifact near nothing progress scale downward whole idea would much better adventure game areas scaled difficulty gear scaled away origin nondrastic fashion artifacts didnt give stats didnt actually help characterthe way progress formulaic best find town map buy best gear repeat quests port far enough away get desired amount loot get better loot difficult quest artifact quest rinse repeatim angry game turned way im sad less passion project blunder mess someone seemed like stopped caring fun bought game ive bought loved original since start far nothing like original generally terrible bought game early alpha build playing years ive seen grow alot time yes game needing work small dev team im constantly impressed ive loved game start highly recommend people stick beta changed built fixed things feels like incredible step right direction personally cannot stop recommending game got alot potential bought game years ago loved gotten worth game time alpha definitely got beta love beta love way wollay taken game purely exploration aspect landscapes beautiful abundance mobs npcs fantastic combat system wonderful alpha course im like others would like limitations altered slightly time change improvementscube world one favorites since came even latest rendition think largest issue able go kill mob right gate like alphathe game definitely takes time get used alphamode many years leaving first biome plains hours game time youre patient willing learn take slow perfect game youcube world definitely worth eyes new old players like said plenty time improvement change although dont see needing much bought game alpha love art style combat simple still challenging good game could get hours playtime enjoy however developer extremely unreliable explained due harassment made mental health worse went awol years receiving level harassment looks like disappeared im doubtful even bug fixes near futurei enjoy game however cannot recommend wollay active stops running situation actually communicates people care game tldrgame roughly hours content cannot recommend whilst developer silent seems disappearing bought game like years ago alpha beta versions quite different game still lot potential neutral option yesno recommendation thats would bepros character creation still done well though options though future many classes choose try spec swapped town glidersmounts make getting around easier lots pets tamecons many features teased years game regional lock equipment fine dont like stuff like hang glider etc gets removed id rather get nerfed picking new region makes better somehow less stamina usage glider perhaps way tell npcs talked spamming town find last quest pain friends list isnt sorted lot friends pain find one want joininvite bought game originally loved still love nowupdate honeymoon wore im sad pine better version game near daily wollay come back us bought game six years ago alpha six years enough time wellfleshed fantastic game come rightwrong get pleasure exploring vast empty worlds nothing interesting seedo game twinkie video games interesting ultimately devoid substance youd fun playing tictactoe least theres variety bought game way back alpha good old timesnow broken shell former selfthe addicting gameplay loop made game fully removed replaced cuckolds tale progressi happily continue playing alpha bought game way back came alpha reason dont preorder buy many early access games cool ideas game unfinished dev mia certainly worth state dont expect updates bought game tiny released boring sense progression ripped hands due region locked gear nice due fact people basically made game pee pee poo poo seriously though tf though region locked gear good idea bought game first came loved steam im feeling ill itthe alpha better needs updatethe combat okay rewards skillthe relic system great rewarding way useless skillsthe loot system bad since progression first region completedall items get start feel lame never get keep outside region got intalking npcs fun first giving information region showing locations core region items dungeons begins get tedious quickly thought work temporary region youre makes feel uselessgathering relics levels levels dont mean anything long run higher level means wasted time useless thingsmage broken melee bad enemy mages hardest fight quickly devour health youre melee cant fight dodging doesnt help majority time gets killed fast unless youre anything stealth abilities melee enemy pushover unless melee welltowns cool useless youre going region short timeif want fun choose big region lots things stay eternity would fun start anew another region every great youre basically starting new game every region enter ehh wont tell play game thoughthe game okay pointless game ive ever seen state right games could compare alpha fun kept playing hours actually got better items whent got keep region regionthere mechanics didnt touch end shallowdont buy updated bought game first released basically everything went darki visited everywhere done everything wish never bought itwish creator would keep bringing game back nothing come bought game alpha back day say great confidence alpha way better like concept treasure hunter hunting artifacts leveling system least entirely dont like equipment region locked miss simple skill tree alpha made leveling feel rewarding want play game wait months gets updated wollay might fix game sees bad reception bought game years ago put hours heard getting update sprung sorely disappointed dev effectively mia little communication number years guess shouldnt surprised update hot mess sure annoyed worth money find alpha version want know game like bought game years ago alpha showed lots promise years silence developers excited heard something finally happening cube world unfortunately longer game paid game mechanics totally overhauled making game far less enjoyable removing sense accomplishment known direction game going go would never paid simply give game positive review current form wish developers would revert game alpha start wanted rpg thought paying dont know enjoyable bought game years ago super excited play hes really done anything years definitely feel like another money grab hes gone silent bought unfinished game five years ago co op fun friends didnt imagine tech demo would see light day steam bit polished state game back difficult recommend others playing game solo certainly wouldnt buy full price todayi would recommend getting sale fun mess around friends totally boring bought sale alpha period addition quests flight paths thing positive added negatives still remain spawn near enemies times health double damage find gear quests often rather far requiring long walk said overpowered mobs gank causing respawn away quest making walk longer hope game gets better also hoping would get better years sorry wolly least take solace fact didnt wait years play game like people game fun say alpha much fun betabeing shotted every mob visible region fungearlocked progression funlosing gear switching region fun recommend cube world current statethe region lock system really solution want play game blocks hinders much logical expansion game almost seems like joke alpha near perfect still great base expand upon easily excusable alphas meant expanded upon current version game go peon god literally one item drop rng reflects progression rate like region lock system invented could become incredibly op impossible alpha bar shitting cows non cyan dungeons level walk steps right brought back pleb status balance permanent combat upgrades would make problem worse point self would feel useless hit certain percentage would unceremoniously become god literally anywhereit also seems past years combat worked enemies run predictable manner sure different skins effectively like fighting mob others projectile based spittersnout beetlearchermage beaten simply walking left except mages dodgeable mages ring mages combat boring literally useless kill world quests drop better items enemies even fill barthere long term goals unless want increase light radius forever asking much actually actual progression mobile game nibble experience slowly work fully featured skill tree going spawn encountering different biomes harder smarter enemies maybe actual reason grind long term goal take bosseslords requires use brain beat instead using hit kite tactic require iq executethere much things wrong could effectively go forever might update later recommend game current state good idea going extremely bare bones doesnt replayability justify purchasing yet major flaws core progression game creator refuses acknowledge even communicate maybe another years game worth buying right nowlook game called veloren much potential game still enjoy game region locking new progression system also understand people dont like since feels unnatural still good game however maybe could bettersidenote soundtrack really nice still remember kind enjoying game years ago years late still game worse really sure dev managed kinda trash ngl understand design decision reset weapons armor understand design decision seeds rather one preset giant map based one seedi dont understand removing levels experiencei dont understand removing skill tree favor current skill systemi dont understand removing basically types cube usage pixelarting weaponi dont understand removal utility items supposed capital supposed procedural supposed faction leaders faction interactions faction gear years waiting game completely different promised even back twitter updates etcthe worst part fact cant even play game properly since towns dungeons framerate tanks legitimately computer runs starcraft ultra perfectly fine cube world tanks fps singledigit reallyeven taking consideration plea emotions depression etc wollay pixxie go fullon radio silence pretty clearly exit recommend game current state maybe created modding tools somethinga shame since part backers way back cant accurately recall many hours ive played game long ago bought even though loved way back still felt thought missing much even though lot changed release game still feel like taken change better progression experience wisepros things really enjoy cube worldtowns feel alive npcs give directions certain landmarks region give questsi like world consistent seamless friends join progression per character never need start go friends instance places visited always marked completedin older builds game feel like progression getting better gear leveling far slow understand gear per area still feel like im able get something done recent buildi like time passes dont recall older builds game time scaleplaying friends makes game infinitely entertaining specializations fore class makes things feel little unique far game play styles go even depending weapons friends pickthe map always visible even havent place however places havent learned marked map also use map locate areas youve already making easy find places youve youve fast traveled friend far away startedeven though start scratch new regions fun especially friendsive noticed game seems biomes something dont think existed older builds game years ago havent yet really enjoy happy see far game come excited see planned futureconsmisc game perfect things dislike games enjoy arent things definitely think need fixing per se however feel mentioneddespite said progression feeling faster find new gear use make new region game effects gear doesnt transfer per area unless name gear brought outside area full stats neighboring regions annoying time one youre playing equal ground areas havent previously explored artifacts give small boost becoming stronger overall take time overall feel like could worth iti feel like game balance issues far ai go mages feel especially powered cases almost didnt aim hit beam fire especially devastating travels point b instant said classes like rangers opposing mages dispose almost fairly warriors rogues may disadvantage due short rangeequipment crafting doesnt really seem like viable way obtaining gear since crafting materials arent common also crafted gear like gear useless outside region crafted better find buy equipmentfinding items like boat hang glider new areas little annoying youve grown used using mostly traveling significantly easier themthere ton races character creation options id love see available players usewith said really want people consider giving game chance ive noticed getting lot hate people barely spend time playing write review saying shouldnt spend money copy friend game ask theyll let try arent certain buying yet feel like lot offer even flaws like said game perfect cant join game say could initialize already everything fix finally cant tell fix get rate good cant level pets anymore happened ocean biome ware lots enemies cool bosses ocean feels like big empty blue crater nothing hell happened progression system fun intriguing explore new biomes find new bosses level beat even super strong enemies punishes exploring outside starter area thought good idea disappointment anyone even little touched alpha cant love game anymorewhen first played earlier version sense wonder world around hope explore find new things gain strength overcome new lands find one mighty weapon vanquish evilnow gonei think game disgust hope dreams would vanishing forevermy longing sword power shield vengeance none would ever last longthe exploration may still exist cultists witches dispatch land would never find hero see sword power shield vengeance value new land scouring continent sacred glory touch new ground strength

whence came new reign would need located region new boat glider well suffer maliceforever saddened fate objects world find unable move forward drawn instead lands power forged steel crafted wood remain foreverfarewell cube world may never see another kind cant recommend people buy cube world already game better modding get good version love wollay hope youre shut game flopped cant recommend game right many bugs many changes like bad region locks removing xp gain skill tree whats point even mention many bugs lag spikes friends countless internet problems occurred like sudden fog walls invincible enemies forced disconnections overall much happened much changed became one big sshhiittstorm hope fix broken game actually deliver promises review cant recommend game based dramatic changes gone seemingly removed lot existing planned content willing change review gets better though cant recommend game anyone likes rpgs drastic changes made core gameplay loop cant recommend game current state progression boring artifacts repetitive grind lead rather stale game play enjoy first area immensely maybe second come point get sick thing virtually gain imagine clearing dungeon getting shot mage bosses way open artifact chest lantern light thanks wont keeping eye cube world updated change review figure way make fun engaging cant recommend gamethe region locking mechanic slow start hour two running around hoping find piece equipment allows actually something make game excruciatingly boring swap regions againits tedious boring insanely grindy mention long term rewards get useless since stuff goes towards gets taken away region anywaysmodders hope game developers gone ghost havent given updates since launch cant recommend current statethere may content overall concept game changed much isnt recognizable anymoreand isnt fun anymore long run cant say much hasnt said already since early alpha days filled great promise amazing systemsafter thinking little bit yes way progression works resetting upon zone entry make marvel play multiplayer dont worry leagues ahead friends things oneshotted fumbles aboutbutthat could easily done multiplayeronly world scaling together something feelsanticlimaticid type lot people already done new thing say hope wolay maybe relax much toil may everyone wanted consider finished mind find break please wolay plenty lessons learned theres kinda nothing better move point cant understand people defending game incredibly boring wouldnt play freeeven people claim like dont weeks playtimein addition development awful barely additions game alpha years ago additions worseits bad im waiting dev announce joke real version coming soon cannot recommend due fact dev took years release game almost step back alpha go radio silent get kind communication ill likely change review dont see game improving cannot recommend game current state like refined alpha teased back january wouldve probably different opinion cannot recommend game alljust fact equipment region locked enough much worseafter years screenshots wollay posted showing features implemented dont existthe things promised alphas roadmap nowhere seen cant forget removed xp skillsthe universal progression system game artifacts overall miniscule combat boosts diminishing returns dont make impact allits less game alpha version cannot recommend game current state much changed removed alpha different isnt necessarily bad feel finished core gameplay loop fun region based equipment feels half baked losing travel items especially feels bad top removal many promised planned features kind makes feel like wasnt intended version instead got id keep eye see anything happens post release still potential could next mans sky cannot recommend game early alpha adopter patiently let wollay take time im baffled almost ways less game alpha things promised halcyon days nowhere found features many us looking forward included state game launch laughable im sure people enjoy game bought died somewhere along way hope game gets post launch content perhaps complete reenvisioning strong doubts cube world nothing would make happier come back change review game become promised instead suddenly became cannot say like changes made game played alpha game still pretty charming maybe get get run five frames per second worked fine minutes frame rate tanked reasons hope find fix computer powerful enough run itdidnt get play much maybe issues game fixed modders cant describe amount disappointment feelcube world one favorite games cube world anymore sure worth moneytime dont buy noti cant believe waited years instead fun open world rpg received hard boring pointless repetitive experiencesorry truth cant recommend game state im sorry waited years cant write name characters cant play paid euros game thought good six years ago cant even play game like b r u h wait ive played league legends years amount shit theyve put cannot even comperehend completed zone thought venture onto ocean see find seconds setting sail boat magically vanished region locked exploration gearafter waiting years release game im gonna go back play alpha couldve maybe overlooked gear changes taking away boats gliders etc changing zones takes away fundamental aspect game cant say changes made encourage exploring take away tools exploring current progression system turns every zone checklist makes feel like starting new game everytime leave zone essentially progression think progression system attempt hide fact actually still content game around hours youll experienced everything game offer think definitely worth get sale around maybe consider wait content added decided change thoughts game giving much time actually trying multiple times going new biomeszones clearing much work time rewards get stats get complete dungeon minute worth getting takes hours complete one biomezone state game currently recommend getting game first hours fun complete first dungeon back square one gear worked hard useless new biomezone wait see creators change game see mod game future really need say negative nancies roomthis rpg play different commonly used people complaining locked region gear however actually explore notice adventuring regions bad people think beafter playing new version game tips guys think choretalk every npc biggest help gamei would recommend trying explore ocean regions first objectives towns islands annoying thing find boat get smooth sailing pun intendedpeople also complaining exp exp gain different yes different played alpha still tried bad unlock artifacts fight inside castles regionbiome defeat boss inside rewarded stat boost either swimming climbing pet speed torch range etcthis game makes explore lot done go new biome mark everything map doesnt look normal middle mouse button example strange circle formation stones mark map white dark looking mini houses mark lava pool inside frozen biome mark anything see normal looking map mark likely something importantyou need give game time making judgements decided wait long write review wanted wait give developers chance something truth told fun time cube world liked whole artifact thing core gameplay fun enough however even like get boring really fast especially hearing exact sounds music adnosium think thing game really needed patches kind work done perhaps new region maybe option go back old progression players liked etc instead seems happened devs totally disapeared hope still working maybe planning big patch like mans skys developers vanished think waited long enough put two cents right game fells yet abandoned know comunity puts lot pressure devs behavior vanishing reason returning years game built much resentment game updated seemed like picroma actually gave shit would whole heartedly recommend hell remove review day something happens though conclude would recommend game sheer fact developers ridiclious belief acceptable totally vanish reason danm time enjoy gamei never got play much alpha due overall bad open world exploration rpgs back went game unexpecting mindsetthe game becomes repetetive maybe hours everytime enter new region lose boat glider climbing spikes reins even gear gets reset starting back square one mention every zone seems even things available themthe game lacks simple things saving progress lore discover ability descriptions non existantthere lot needed id call even close enjoyable exploraition experience grind every zone play alpha game maybe thats like pretty chill grindy adventure game play friends brutal start learn systems place master regionthen much want region new adventurehonestly polarizing title lot history ive known cube world month really dig price right youve following cube world years seems like youre expecting perfection youre letdown play alpha back day developer went radio silent save tweet two every year hadnt followed development game closely release surprise one thought welcome character creation hours ive played game time writing cannot im sure recommend game current state youre thrust world seems almost required speak every single friendly npc tutorial get help youre dropped world basic gear near town left devices longer possible use skill defeat harder enemies gear level handle one shot gameplay loop talking npcs beating enemies grinding loot beating quest areas level youre geared enough dungeons containing artifacts increase movement speed tiny increments compelling feels almost pointless reach neighboring region gear completely useless special items boat glider unusable find progression reset aside tiny boost movement speed artifacts new regions lot easier play friends multiplayer theres issues since everyone spawns far away everyone aside host end star gear everyone flies via flight master dont know game progress even updated big patches hope improves game recommend friends play alpha back came enjoyed serious flaws game felt alive variedmy issue current version isnt really gear lack leveling etc rather fact game world seems much emptier barren used power mobs seemingly randomized example would chicken star solo start game star crab cant avalanche issues map generation like campfires spawning bottom ocean star mob packs spawning top npcs essential progression didnt expect game released like dont recommend didnt play alpha version cant say anything game compared current version honestly great exploration action rpg usually overlapping genres experience point progression action progresses exploration longer either challenge rewarding cube world avoids problem softregion locking progression exploration done region still helps regions knowledge artifacts isnt region locked artifact buffs start make improved quality life rewarding feeling going love able encounter higher level enemies im geared evaluating like explorer whether fight possible whether worth moment even start area completely surrounded enemies cant deal flight master completely visible map make always scout new regions im even hang glide spots likely combatfree events like chests top hill try start bit gear therealso playing friends incredibly easy everyone massive map spawned different areas inviting people seamless fast traveling onto eachother easy classes compliment eachother items shared without ever worry buddy leveled dungeon advicescout map ahead time using mouse button place stars map zoom scan around looks like unnatural event plan youre routes finding town flight master near shrine goal love sweeping new areas themuse flight master often free travel friends one nice thing flight spots purchase gold one time purchases use often want afterwardstart island ocean areas youre trouble land use flight master island hop youve found boatlastly im usually complete perfectionist rpg exploration games wanting find everything im finding game fun taking taking pace great friends someone whos area probably tons spare gear joining already started problem didnt played alpha watched videos itthat said love game love system well thought couldnt imagine exp system region locked gear would work epic endlessly playable rpg wouldnt region locked gear would steam roll every region first one exp system would later steamroll thorugh everything system constantly stronger enemies wouldnt work aswell numbers would rise rise pc crashes well maybe also algorithm would hard programm thinkjust think genius system completly different everything know awesome wish ideas like also dont feel like starting bad time find items give huge starting bonus next region quest likely star weapon hour easypoints improvementartifacts rewardingmore quest way plsmaybe also quest limited specific biome type always see something newquestpls lemme pet petmore structuresbiome limited structuresin general contentmore symbols waypoints would nicebetter balancing different classes believe game room expand currently figure theres lot content behind think wollay always room improve thougheventually one area get point cant find anymore quests npcs area know dont items areaoverall think game definitely room improvement also enjoyable current state enjoy game however remember original one alpha came watched favorite youtubers playing became excited finally able use something could get play saw longer sale extremely upset found happened waited waited waited every would see something new pop wollays twitter announcement release dropped everyone including excited finally came saw almost everything weve seen twitter updates longer game lot stuff changed feel like game still great though think need slight improvements moving different zone works think progression much longer things increase stats permanently hopefully wollay listen majority fan base make improvements well wait see indeed like game kind know wollay thought makeing big changes removing exp system sooooooo reagon lock literally everything except stuff think reagon lock ok removing boat hang glide bad think shouldnt use mods stop still exp mod guy working skill artifacts alot like gear stats combat system good first gonna get rekt everythingi watched alot videos im saying saw videos hours gameplay like game super confusing dont take wrong way minecraft clear way starting since game come years least people know trove clear way telling quest dont know cube world game acts like sandbox want way opinion add way see quests unlock talking npcs going memory much take new player like hope add something like would make worth miss infinitely scaling skill trees alpha otherwise overall improvementi love exploration aspect game regions lot smaller used time theres somehow much onetheres plenty incentive talk wandering npcs many add points interest map points interest often regional gear upgrades upgrades include gnomes raise quality items buy town crafting books allow craft higher quality itemsthe combat amazing maybe even better subclasses feel defined used differences much prominent dodging still always subclasses ability jump higher usual allowing dodge horizontal attack jumping quite useful feels absolutely amazing pull offmy biggest gripes game regional gear lack information locking gear specific region feels like inconvenience anything reins boat especially problematic riding readily available form transportation sailing far fastestas telling player whats doesnt really happen kind get thrown right game making character information get abilities youre left figure everything else barebones control scheme nothing game explained youi would talk multiplayer isnt clear dont friends game thus dont opportunity figure process playing coopi loved playing alpha love still worked time love finally released im thrilled playing full game heavy exploration aspect npcs helpful finding good stuff figure lot stuff still amazingly fun play like game right hate workswaited years loving original game thinking every yearwhat kind alpha player liked full legendary geared liked combat hence loved dungeon farming geari liked strong got exploring felt strong enoughnew cube world doesnt offer cant recommend game right nowam saying game absolutely noteverything changed happens spread good word game recommend buying years dead silence get game feels like even less content alpha released back hope devs dont go radiosilent respond criticism improve game doubtful recommend buying game brings joy rep recommend game current difficulty curve steep start barely able fight even weakest mobs strength entirely based loot drops either get lucky find drops make overpowered early unlucky find constantly fear attacking anything doesnt take much theres also structure spawns much chance running legendary beast common weaker enemy fresh crafting doesnt really help game crafting barely feels worth times resources either feel rare expensive better chance finding better loot grinding gear regionlocked youll see pointed multiple reviews yes gear applies region picked go outside region becomes useless gear drops allow keep stats venturing another region gear rare ive also heard gear limit regions used cant say sure played long enough test special abilities pick also given treatment gear leave region goes away includes things like hang gliders ability ride pets combat bit shallow nice abilities change based weapon change specialization town thats start abilities change play game found attack combination works expect keep using duration play little progression game youre fortunate enough get gear make nearly unstoppable wipe region clean get artifacts leave region however different starting new character progression get artifacts boost things like running swim speed even differences negligible youll barely notice change youre grind difference look biome enemies youll facein summary game shallow mess endless pointless grind clearing region moving another one different remaking character first hours game play pretty much entire game change scenery lamp light radius little bigger think game lives alpha state numerous systems things game quite fun complete first region youre left nothing start blocks sidei think game good game essence couldnt recommend recommend keep eye see anything changes game positive manner write reviews felt like needed things find stupid complain aboutmost people complaining alpha completefleshed game actually side step yes xp system gone yes lose items cross zones mark changes make game constantly challenging encourages completion zones make next one easier without change players would become overpowered making bored quickly point infinitely generating world lastly complain creator ignoring community feel entitled dev man team job struggled mental health think drop everything cater say need grow upthings actually bad decisionnot allowing use transportation artifacts transportation essential get game walking around feels slow riding mount keeping transportation would make easier go biomes keeping difficulty new areas well artifacts annoying part though grinding hours area big reward artifact improves transportation minuscule amount personally know replace needs change something useful fun maybe different colored mount idkwhy giving game positive reviewi spent hours release playing game friends blast game visually appealing game challenging enough kill us constantly poor teamwork leaves extremely satisfied beat mob extremely difficult combat satisfying different weapons different things giving player bunch different ways playshould buy gameyou buy enjoy game sink hours ability watch show something require full attention enjoy unique style game never played game enjoyable friendsyou buy want game years ago want overpowered challenged hours think aaa game ability fix criticism weekthings hope forfixing transportation different biomes artifacts would also appreciate gradual increase classes player play maybe add druid another healing class besides game great hope people give honest try instead giving hate train game originally almost like everyone played years ago dont agree everybody whos dissapointed game understand dont entirely agree think lot things change years dont get mad game believe update improved already really fun game issues wont deny believe however issues nearly innevitable especialy minimal playtesting throughout years blast game espeacially multiplayer go grab friends make even better dont care hype dont care expectations enjoying game couldve something greater still could game fun worth price enjoying lot playing greatest dream game developer doesnt get discouraged negative reviews continues work game people seem forget game made entirely one man wife like right end story id love see content added dont even know start review honestly bought knowing update would suck wanted see yeah right sucks level system region lock items enemy level scaling skill tree completely killed awesome progression game feeling explore world would like know dev really thought region locking items would good move everyone would like game completely sucks current state dont even motivation move another region explore map completely dumb way items equipment work played alpha version till lvl cant even play one hour straight without ragin entire system dont buy wolfram add mod support let community fix game end wanted play old cube world dont even really know startits absolutely baffling people trying hard defend update almost inarguable made game worse years agoi really really wanted refall love game changes mind boggling im sure someone else made comprehensive list unnecessary changes important one change core gameregion locked progressionthis change beyond dont think ive ever seen case developer absolutely destroying work much one sincerely hope wollay going return older form update full game release severely doubt changes game back used ill change review positive one rather negative onedo buy sunkcostfallacy fans waited years full release waiting six years full release justify downright bad game unless wollay fixes core gameplay cannot recommend game good consciousnesshonestly youd better playing alpha dont find process losing progress gear mobility items repeatedly explore new regions compelling gameplay loop stands artifacts worth effort obtain provide substantial upgrades cannot recommend cube world current state dont know fellas kinda like new changes dont like wally region lock everything else really fun time game amazing opinion get mod disables region lock dont like dont like idea restarting completing zone get small buff next zone small buff may even go towards increase damage defense traveling around big maps hassle dont pet yet reins reacquire go another zone way know people might like kind game reminds much mobile clicker games dont like gamethats dont like game become said mod removes region lock fantastic multiplayer game good fun im still fun update stop fun get mod enjoy good game dont normally leave reviews however case felt compelled tomany individuals upset cube world live expectations rpgnow following game years always understood passion project team two think thats alot unsatisfied reviews forget game wasnt created large team infinite resources said people correct questionable game design choices however choices opinion make game unplayable fun still enjoy playing cube world still love game wollay pixxie thank work love put making unique experience dont recommend buying game yet since unfinished probably wont finished time soon dont recommend game expensive little brings relevant progression running simulatior feels unfinished much games better cube world cheaper cash grab release break promises coward developer literally zero comunication dont suggest playing game nothing like version purchased dont think people give wollay enough credit talentbecause idea else make game badi game years since alpha lacking terms content pretty fun combat simple fun dodging warrior could also block skill trees simple satisfying allowed get stronger stronger abilities usually pretty simple uses would often spam much possiblei loved knockdown stuff luckily combat hasnt changed much basically using heavy attack knock enemy attack satisfyingremember mentioned skill tree yeah well removed rpg game apparently theres way upgrade stats couldnt stand playing game longer especially shadow much fun used anyway start abilities unlocked youd think cant possibly difficult enemies spawn practically random levels cant fight half things encounter alpha would sometimes encounter bulls pain pretty much impossible kill half times died chance well cause pull hair years wollay add skills rework map maybe one asked skill tree removed try game release jesus christ wollay dont think horrible game could good problem friends multiplayer spawn literally kilometers apart im refunding game unless gets good update im purchasing dont understand people complaining game much better years ago definitely doesnt punish exploration regions big take everything moving one region another gear set back part replay valuethe previously released version cube world alpha alphas always subject change given time developer clearly thought direction right one gameof course game isnt without flaws artefacts could maybe work transition regions probably forgiving glidersboats etc waiting long game im happy able play polished version dont understand loot levels restore go different biome good game travel experience bad need find city rare level system changed good defet monster day long quest dont gonna level need find artifacts thats really rare skills system good deleted could make complicetd bigger made small poor thats beta game improves good luck update make better dont understand reviews negative personally cant stop playing see people dont like region progress thing wich indeed little bit wierd without would ran content much faster time explore regionsi think developer add something like artefact related place place number artefacts get combat bosses something like thataside game great play good amount time personally im great time playing alone friend general ideea game relied exploring combat see wayby way game worth money friends play times much entertaining playing fiends choose different classes dont fight lootthanks attention dont usually write reviews seeing negative feedback getting feel like musti loved game back alpha years ago even though little different im still ton funis game would recommend someone thinking playing solo maybe friends game countless hours amazing funif didnt receive game due paying alpha wouldve purchased either wayim really looking forward content updates cant wait play dont usually write reviews almost feel need game let potential buyers know expect game moving forward ill try structure concise orderly fashion make things easy possible understand included tldr bottomill limit review two subjects developer game developerthis game quite bit controversy baggage attached feel potential buyer made aware first game announced sold around years ago alpha state included roadmap development well received many looking forward new planned features detailed said roadmap first weeks release developer released minor bug fixes disappeared six years read correctly six years communication whatsoever occasional twitter update saying things like new map system works every year interaction community updates game explanation going nothing whatsoever many theories disappeared well official statement developer choose believe implore research matter six years later returns announcing cube world steam well beta launched old alpha players jumped try everything went south like really south people happy changes dev made expressed dissatisfaction steam forums discussion page dev respond lock delete negative posts ban users giving negative feedback essentially trying censor silence naysayers community people got angry forums became battlefield white knights mods flamers valuable focused feedback thoughts getting lost somewhere things calmed somewhat forums still something mess sad part even whole mess developers little voice communicating community done nothing address communitys concerns way shape formnow get point developer recommending game simply put cant trust support game last time sold disappeared six years leaving clients hanging whats say wont also going actually communicate community developer terrible track record arguably perfect example everything developer indie never im sorry say faith trust developer feel obligated warn potential users approach developer caution theres much say developer handling game order keep things concise ill stop game itselfso six year disappearance developer comes back everyone ecstatic excited see back see game fell love fully released finally excited see added sixyear period new quests dungeons regions classes items etc added short answer well cube world wasnt even close game promised six years ago features actually taken rather added features like leveling skills random map seed generation armor weapons new leveling system boy large number players like simple look forums reddit show roadmap developer presented us initially selling game thrown wayside wouldnt problem except fact developer never communicated changes player base paying customers blindsided us radical controversial changes game paid supported six years ago heres outline new game mechanics process give potential buyers idea game worksyou spawn almost naked random location oftentimes get killed repeatedly higher sometimes leveled mobs rhyme reason spawn locations spawned next legendary tier enemy maybe get lucky rng cause mob drop piece gear youre extra lucky gear class playing actually wearable also random quests random npcs give gear youre lucky youll find one matches tier level somewhat close movement game somewhat slow stand good chance accidentally running higherlevel mob path kill rinse repeat geared tier gear fight tier mobs rinse repeat way tier take area dungeon get artifact artifact increase random stat related exploration extremely minor increases swim speed sailing speed climbing lantern light etc combat increases whatsoever keep mind thats important part comes later leave area go back beginning paragraph read except time dont spawn walk im serious leave area everything character resets gear resets back zero lose exploration items hang glider boat harp flute etc literally start back zero like started new game thats gameplay cycle cube world remember artifacts dont really end helping new areas boats hang gliders spent time trying find previous region gone let alone fact artifacts dont help combat whether good system everyone decide absolutely despise feel new changes terrible game seems punish one factors made great alpha thats exploration beg research formulate opinions quests procedurally generated overarching story complete meaning likely thing every region area literally quests different names different locations cube world used endless exploration adventure seems focus endless repetition well almost endless considering one map seed everyone game shares unlike minecraft map actually finite run things eventually ever get fartldrthe game surrounded controversy developer poor history involving limited abandoning community years changing game exponentially initially promised roadmap without letting customers know censoring community etc new gameplay cycle fun engaging real progress made ever dont want overly negative support developer long journey get leave honest opinion current gamewhen purchased alpha family played heck girls would collect pet treats fun regenerating worlds son would go exploring leveling try get strong enough beat difficult dungeons fun game fun excited morehere many years later kids grown less time game grind unfun everything seems geared pun intended long plays spending lots time collecting stats order get item artifact move onto another area cant pickup play like used game forcing playstyle dont like everything thought fun alpha removed cannot give current version good review game years ago would never bought itwe got moneys worth alpha hopefully continue play wont playing current version tried fun hopefully dev reconsiders many changes returns cubeworld unique inventive game years ago mark dont want lose hope gamei still like fact mods easily addable game makes good dont write reviews games suggest anyone looking buy game wait improve game right terrifically fun rewarding truly different alpha amazing dont get hatehave watched alot videosstreams finally play myselfi really like dont know ever read guy bought game alpha many years ago old enough buy pc minecraft came friends always looking alternative like stumbled upon game honestly didnt play whole lot concept exactly wanted alpha kinks checked game every year like years think read dealing mental struggles trying make everyone wanted pressure put apologize hope matter people say overcoming struggle finishing something big game found peace closure id love see game grow become even expected even hope well dont need write lot honestly game lacks lot things enjoyable long run like meaningful progression one biome pretty much covered everything since reset every biome region lock mechanic needs get skill trees back combat pretty boring crafting items pointless crafting materials pretty scarce artifacts get completing biome less underwhelming meter radius upgrade lantern fun get provide use really since dont see shit night anywaythis game could great state cant recommend anyone reallyi still hope devs turn around even dont adress concerns fanbase pretty much funded game dont recommend would fix messed would great levels would actually give useful stats alpha dont think bad game lot going good game cant recommend right region locked gear hang glider etc times im sailing boat randomly disappears new region really puts damper exploring huge map dont even know gona start wait game long time like many others game get still pretty good like play like walking try find staff around end game fine goldyellow gear end gona travel next region thet moment progress stop coz max gear lvl gona kill every thing take h get one think able full gear fully completed regions dont fell progress fell character stronger anything find blue weapon plus gona make half task next region easy hell dont really care people saying game ive waiting play years thoroughly enjoying dunno couple friends bought alot fun playing played alpha released years back yah stuff changed doesnt bother like looking artifacts killing getting killed bosses dont really mind whole losing gear travelling new region fun go new place get strong also think could cool changes might make game better course skill tree thing alpha interesting dunno impactful maybe would cool gear game adjusted cd damage effects skills something like dunno couple pets think pet ui stats page would nice maybe pet skills tooi think biggest thing like player coop buddies always run problem finding games play together perfect us make one friends play water mage op healing anyways fun enough friends dont like thats fair feel like people salty changed think naturally people really resistant change enjoy game enjoy enjoy game region lock putting overall enjoy game fighting works dugeons changed alpha enjoy game level system different normal system im fine sits well cant wait play friends enjoy game someone didnt play alpha doesnt live alpha version still fun play rights recommend playing friends add experience enjoy game better worse alpha list basic combat greatly improved alpha addition subclass unique ultimates advanced combat made worse removal spirit cubes olist looked cool added buffs weapons help combat olist equipment region locked exception gear effective neighbouring regions one unlocked fixes medium term balancing expense short long term balancing boats gliders reigns also region locked meaning olist exploration current region encouraged exploration neighbouring regions discouraged olistlist enjoy despite controversies difficult equipment challenge enjoyed alpha hundreds hours mostly multiplayer alone obviously worth im probably going tossed biased category isnt biased choice purchase current state without playing first would im honestly sure however say running one area solo rewarding challenging fun get hang mechanics running second area fun well couple pieces blue gear hours challenging fun worth dont know id buy current description reviews ive never felt ripped ive played plenty games cost hrs enjoyment rest multiplayerim looking forward trying bit friends ill probably bench keep eyes open updates might fix progression issues perfect worth yes frustrating yes game interesting design doesnt top list games id replay hundreds hours hopes could hope devs dont disappear id like see continued improvements game bit begin next project either way id recommend playing like voxel style games adventure rpg feel enjoyed kind realized literally every artifact region locked reason instead maybe making artifacts little sparse encouraging adventure items become nonexistent entering new region becomes grind fest move basic survivability enjoyed playing game friends family regions disappointed everything longevity regions got gold weapon everything around easy challenge point also feels like missions finding items hope modding community save know fact wolly isnt good enough developer enjoyed alpha also love game nowdo buy game expect game alpha stage changedif like gameplay mechanics buy enjoyed alpha game lot still enjoy playing beta changed overall still enjoy even hours feel bad making negative review still support creators personschoices made games design kills fun people including carfeul want buy everyone find motivation continue playing first zone completed possible game fits standards consider buying feel like case feel like might person doesnt problem game tried playing sure isnt alpha finished product ever alpha beta idk man think fun also admit music nice feel like went car dealership payed ticket draw free car arrive find got golf cart needed money repairs buying new car feel like alpha actual beta beta actual alpha happen feel like potential still treasure system updated include permanent buffs useful character skills would wonderful plus think weapons continued evolving got instead becoming useless would help feel like theres reason go next zone ive zone started might well start new character since relic upgrades hilariously get gear yeah thats cool ive never seen one drop besides likely would class im feel like game gets criticism deserves simply didnt live years worth hype yes flaws region locking gear annoying progression overall individual regions bit jank still find plenty fun requires patience like exploring completing games youll get good longevity aesthetic charming combat fun albeit unfair times apparently alpha skill based havent played yet familiar become current systems pull better feels yes flaws game half decade ago sounds like something might like chances feel like product direct reflection emotional rollercoaster developer went years worked product wish wolfram best game feels empty compared back alpha small children may enjoy currently worth price tag feel bad writting think share experience beta played piracy version beta cuz didnt buy years agowell years waiting many us expected many things watching wollay posting incredible pictures twitter huge cities huge bosses many things dont remember always tought game going boom comes awesome wrongin web developer see things actually waiting like skill threes many things actually feel frustrated high cant describei much wollay fun im probably always going know pass trought always tried add content add things new version waiting fori played hours say played content yes mean hours know content literally complete game mean get legendary whats next repeat whole cycle thanks loli hoping wollay breaking cycle make something different indeed hes current path actual mechanics broken thats think mean hell man maybe someone complain say dont understand rpg roguelike played many cant literally think years development game theres nothing play maybe im hater perspective im huge fan wollay know fix moment think game bad hours everyone say expect people obv dont think mechanics bad badly implementedall mechanics need good implemented things like skill tree bosses bassed lore game fix region lock add custom weapons add huge cities potions armors add contenti play months weeks know wollay change perspective view game moment game worth hours cant recommend im probably wrong im aspects hurts much write negative review waiting years wollay please turn bad game one everyone remember lives feel old progression system much better new one turned game feel many noticed progression game alpha beta changed much however think could serve good way guide game back towards greatness wont damn game use alphas progression tje betas exploration aspects like region system minus gear locking could see game becoming good played ton alpha would prefer leveling skill system anyday though voicing oponions negarive light send wollay back abyss nother years id want avoid tyvmas community cube world enthusiasts formerly make clear current path game taking steered clear knew loved game maybe maybe make game keep making betteras review cant recommend atm dont think project doomed either find cubeworld fun game tho one big thing may turn leaving region armor weapons utilities region locked means got god year sword region region b sword super weak basically unusable thats armor also need refind stuff region like boat hand glider things change feel better game really slows get explore regions fly one aiming quests doesnt sound like something wont like isnt game permanent stuff game like artifacts crafting material potions food find strange many people dislike new system exploration comes question whether want create new characters become overpowered new system id argue pretty innovative needs minor tweaking become hit system basically allows infinitely play character without becoming broken beyond compare encourages travel explore new area foot yeah feels like starting new character terraria know sucks hermes boots wings awhile get used system wouldnt work locations looked like crap uninteresting thankfully cube world looks incredible vistas game almost breathtaking breath wild thats saying something mention much content present compared alpha different factions dungeons enemies etc theres lot see well worth potentially infinite amounts fun friends know played hours alpha alone heres another find game fun explorative rpg flaws im interested seeing changes happen beta period first encountered cube world sometime alpha even available buy obscure site name completely lost memory dont think around anymore couldnt refind id occasionally visit page keep date development never thought id get make steam review cube world due part fact knew cube world even knew steam played alpha bunch enjoyed immensely however would reach review likely aware alpha went unupdated game spent years isolated development following years silence like many others received complementary steam key gave steam release tryall said years development isolation simultaneously kind quite unkind cube world many ways game improved example combat removal skill tree giving players full set abilities start makes much consistent streamlined set combat mechanics help make moment moment gameplay enjoyable building character easier streamlined terms environments biomes shrunk meaning longer takes major time investment find new environment type explore theres lot new content experience terms new environmentsworld generation equipmentquests etchowever release isnt without issues lot draw comparison alpha flow progression almost entirely eradicated compared alpha rpg style levelling system gutted region based system left place loot exclusively useful region obtained though loot also used neighboring regions furthermore utility items like boat hangglider treasure tracker reigns etc region exclusive region biome every time move one biome next essentially start game maybe little boost loot cube worlds greatest fault currently stands writing review almost entire removal overarching progression bringing focus away constantly seeking stronger opponents thoroughly exploring smaller areas power take dungeons artifacts simultaneously made exploration areas feel completely redundant main goal game rigid structure renders cube world pointless second cross border one region another thing keep permanently artifact buffs come form small buffs specific types movement speeds ie hang glider speed boat speed climbing speed etc well lantern light radius take many increments even make remotely tangible improvementi never managed get enough category point felt anymore powerful dont make powerful make faster faster traverse areas faster move next areas traverse faster well yet significant portion movement types youre upgrading need reunlocked every region significant portion time alpha spend exploring map traversing world fun new system doesnt allow region minicubeworld rigid structure forced world means goal area work way strong enough getting artifact youve scoured biome artifacts either stay mess around cleared biome youve unlocked move start process making slower controlled repetitive version game alpha steam release ocean biomes favorite alpha excited oceans finding exploring new world side steam version reason favored oceans oceans lack ambient mob groups open water clearly communicated location points interest one point interest island cut filler gameplay mainland biomes suffered making faster efficient progress anything oceans empty wastes dotted islands points interest located trying prioritize exploration exploration turned chore rather treat spite still fond cube world steam allowed neutral reviews id made review neutral alright would recommend researching game make sure alley even remotely considering content removedchanged since alpha well features promised yet implemented top hype discourse easy lose sight reality gameplay cube world actually like single mans passion project still impressive wollay could quit developing game time thisd last available release game buy youre content fact could never updated content fact could updated way radically changes flow gameplay everyone honestly doesnt deserve nearly much hype praise hate received game everyone outright bad little bizarre developed bubble years possibly back developed bubble wollay returned silence mercilessly harassedtldr cube world alright single mans unfinished passionhobby project hard recommend account frustrating core gameplay loop inconsequential progression allround extremely repetitive nature followed cube world since alpha still great alpha found cube world weeks alpha first taken store page found going sold got super hyped ignored reviews purchased try boy feel bad people played hours cannot get refund one hour playing came across npc characters multiple times lost gear twice due area joined two regions minutes pure walking around looking something every single enemy came across would kick whatever npcs around helps ass new idea xp leveling doesnt make good one clearly executed poorly another complaint game single player unless friends dont think rpg bunch people running around run make friends whats even point exploring also entire map revealed even bunch updates game isnt going playable long time hate say want game like go ahead play gulp trove barf still better interested entertained cube world could ever provide final rating fully recommend game one condition everyone wants buy game install free mod gets rid regionlock makes items scale fixes issues game fairly easily progress game still hopeful developer wife fully integrate changes make game reminding charm old alpha cubeworld gave honest try really years waiting lead disappointment game deviates far expected ittook everything fun like character progression made everything worse fixed stats rng loot cant even use actually getting anywhere slog grinding hard anymore game simply refuses yield point hit brick wall cant get stronger keep trying move fun anymore gave game positive review moved another region get community pissed clear wollay didnt want game like back alpha something became aparrent beta game still great personally sink hours problem play easier start new region money gear might everyone please look videos decide purchase get lot mixed reviews game friend spent days straight playing opinion far worth lot people complaining leveling system removed didnt much impact alpha like levels didnt mean anything anyone whos actually complaining go back play alpha see changes opinion better get complains still great game tho get criticisms different alpha love though really fun game give game positive rating enjoy time though completely understand many people wouldnt think theres interesting ideas done perhaps quite executed best ways main hope developer doesnt get overly discouraged negative reviews obvious interesting design ideas though admittedly could benefit disappearing bit less giving game secound chance honestly lot fun u feel adventure u find play style understand game really takes get good understand difficulty u get reset move new area lore stays plus gear stays region around keep gold consumables crafting gear well nice artifacts gold crafting materials carrying nice buy good gear right away u get shop upgrades eventually enough materials start crafting good gear crafting expensive think system use biomes first also pets carry would cool u could ride time harness region lockedone addition would would add tier plus gear like star gear double plus gear would much harder find craft overall harder get plus gear gear would global could u equipment every region balance would start stars would need powered white green blue purple gold progress like region star gear becomes weaker u find white gear upgrades power star gear star another rarity gear would upgrade star gear yu would weak first biome gear would power upover like concept state game feels like adventure xd got hours fun game play first days beta totally worth didnt play much alphathe start brutal hand holding every time gain items work zone found loved timethe game needs additional character progression get play restarting scratch every new zone gain items gets old quickly also could use many little ui tweaksfor person passion project awesomeberserker forever got boat sailed feet disappeared things like game may change review future updates improve experience worth imho got cube world alpha liking idea rpg got along lines half finished roguelite cant recommend current state got moneys worth good laughs butthis literally scam figuratively literally dont support got alpha first came loved itwell hours beta rage quits latei learning game much changedits like zone world quests gear tied zoneenter new zone starting collecting gear zonemake sure complete zone going nexti hear switch back gear zonesi hope true would nice got warning cross zoneoh well mater adapting changes first step changes alpha release massiveand well done yet run bugsthanks wollay pixie got game way back alpha released liked still like nowthe gameplay quite fun progression unique spent lot time playing games never came across anything like give tip get ahead try making neutral mobs fight hostile ones gear c savagealpha dogsthe developers really nice responded quikly questionsi found bugs considering indie game rate got back loved problem developer completely stripped best parts game went completely silent honestly best scam ive ever seen gg wollay gg got free technically alpha player still want money back games developer vanished twice hope improved upon youre better trying find friend alpha play since got offer got game back alpha even though changed game great even better friends run around see find world got game back alpha beta lot different alpha shouldnt listen everyone complaining changes game game feature doesnt inherently suck different alpha players used personally think game still amazing region locking adds lot gameplay time good thing going get better sure tweaks game could get still amazing game much worth purchase especially friends play withfor example maybe dont remove gliderboatreins miduse make cant reactivate different region wont fall sky stranded ocean let universal get themsecondly specific enemies drop specific loot like rocklings drop ores think right food related enemies drop food loot probably already works something therethird dedicated servers would awesome mmo style enemy respawning first people dont clear everything would love see world full players running around pvp would also spectacular since dying doesnt really take anything fast travel thingmight add later regardless still amazing game get friend play got game today played straight hours honestly fun ive long time much fun exploring land find monsters kill loot find everyone given game bad reviews upset like alpha really like playing got game first came like great many people alpha put hundreds hours playtime excited every time showed possible new addition yearssadly however everything alpha updated version beta removed levels removed exp removed ability keep gear removed skillsyou wanted go island bad strong sudden crossed border epic weapon armour worked getting useless unless small area gamethey added things sure end lose sort triumph sort see thisi got hard work instead repedative constant grind little show everything stops workinghopefully fixes back alpha levels untill ill play old version got key alpha way back feel like downgrade wait buying maybe another years grew cube world alpha loved game much cute design procedural generation amazing combat system understand wollays development timeline game full stress anxiety mental health problems gotta give honest criticism gamethe progression would make sense less instant somehow realistic lose progress explore new area game deflates excitement makes feel progression hasnt happened rpggrind games supposed make feel like youre becoming continually stronger game rips away instant feel extremely bad way wollay treated cube world community release alpha newer steam version guess im minority say actually enjoy game played alpha way back came fun got bored aimless lot world explore much really get people like sandboxes wasnt mecube world got lot flak separated regions individual progression loops equipment special items thats actually favorite thing changed goals start go new place still goals reachif make complaints would regions could bigger gameplay loop could last longer also ocean biomes auto give boatbut hey everyone gets opinion think fun game guess game enjoyable like old fun play sessions launch past days trying play game caused computer crash believe fun truly worth purchase lot fun friends also fun playing solo really enjoy game play lot future also dont understand people keep saying alpha better version alpha beginning also pretty difficult well end game boring repetitive way contentas well bunch fixes game lot fun game alpha still version room improvements already worth price better memories making bets whether game would updated actually playing fun hours lost interest change regions start scratch takes long fully regear time move regions maybe wait sale interested id avoid otherwise gotten game alpha years years ago better back high hopes alpha terrible enjoyable maybe te first region leveling gear farming end absolutely useless sure get ever better hope since loved alpha high hopes new release game played alpha years ago patiently looking forward major update since game current state missing numerous features weve either seen development wollays twitter means big rpg multiplayer gamer really feels like absolutely endgame true progression increases various movement ability types gear drops even legendary feel quite underwhelming say least xp talent trees leveling xp increasing power never removed expanded revised high hopes game like people first liked fair amount realised fcked game isthe alpha showed lot potential better progression system game almost every way betterthe thing hurts fact seems like developer totally abandoned game although game could use updates fixesoverall really mean really want check ous id wait sale unless developer returns would recommend excuse go cry corner high hopes game announced released steam expectations completely trashedthere seems less content alpha version xp system gone instead god forsaken region lock fetature punishes explorationand top havent heard word wollay since launchthis game lot promise opinion got wasted recommend buy game least current state hopes high thought would build promising alpha nah biggest reasons loved game removed changed drastically free exploration restricted region lock mean could explore want wont riding pets hang glider boat climbing claws yeah good luck exploring holding w half hours see weird looking tree something dying something trying find new spawn point walk distance loved huge cities dungeons xp skill tree gone god even miss ear sound sleeping inn also could well make new game create new character instead going new region wouldnt different hate everything previously acquired uselessunusable dont remove game steam library make buy game could explore another area gamejust remember refund window hours played game back alpha whenever come enjoyed greatly share thoughts towards release although realmlocked loot extremely annoying felt like crippling areas simple mod resolves makes game much enjoyable point contention leveling system believe original system much better rewarding whereas leveling feels meaningless mod mentioned disables arealocked loot definitely game would recommend anyone enjoyed alpha quite fun hours absolutely indications losing everything change land also annoying im waiting content change review feels like always thing best moments friends playing alpha sinking hours upon hours well waited waited something come felt like every day wollays twitter waiting excitement hype perhaps undoing undoing many others loved alpha base game cubeworld fun things going questing system needing artifacts level upwhich dont get started brighter yeah ok dont even mind region locking system better done skill trees combat system good fall sky crossing regions actually gave good laugh first time happenedmy overall main issue feels like soul gone game friends could go around hours beating unbeatable dungeons fighting fierce bosses kind want like game anything world cant said core game still fun id say play friends id never played long much journey one imo could make better artifacts useful keeping traveling gear travel regrinding gear fine anyone plays rogue likes fine high hopes cube world sht hit fan everything region locked everything worked hard honestly would super happy uploading alpha version game steam add biomes weapons npcs etc build game since alpha releasethe new leveling system without xp takes getting used think good alternative regular xp levelinggetting better gear way go bit like zelda games also xp system instead rely items become better played version last days enjoyed quite also multiplayer friend minei hope development game contiue current state development recommend pleasure already getting moneys worth alpha sadly game receive imagine wow reach lvl beat final raid get thrown back lvl permanent strength repeat process times total permanent strengthif sounds fun game also developer even semblance community interaction would swell happen hope game choose one im leaning towards thumbs bad game im one gamers bought played original soon came years ago back adventure game lite rpg elements adventure game lite action elements dont fault wollay trying something different messing around new version prefer older systems let start stating game going itpositive beautiful voxel world maybe prettiest voxel genre landscape beckons explore nintendo charm polish look feel sound feels like im playing classic game modern engine collecting pets great past time game assist combat double mounts etc love gaining new pet like questing find something new subbiome explore keeps magical feel open world wonderous place explore plenty different biomes hang gliding mountains boating across oceans deserts jungles oceans volcanic swamps leads thenegative beautiful voxel world explore preferred explore feel handcuffed one biome ocd allows move another think cleaned leads another issue like starting every biome gear specific biome along things enjoy slow build rpg repetitive grind arpg starts constantly id problem wollay going towards arpg rpg keep slow permanent progression would still one major issue combat underwhelming especially warrior class close range class combat feels clunky uninspired since leveling defeating enemies easy task early stages feels unrewarding get coins end avoiding combat fun game trying nudge towards arpgso allinall little disappointed never played alpha recommend checking great game hidden behind counterproductive systems maybe hell fix rerelease itll perfect tons fun old version compared one got replayability fix simply starting new game new seed really enjoyed looking interesting seeds loading playing investigating new version provides couple hours gameplay since region functionally others hours version game think happened everything good fun happened neat features adding advancements tweeted like forgot going sell game studio fixfinish point save face thinking getting dont game fundamentally broken believe steam allowed even sold knowing history clown making hours record played friends ready put away good friend figured system works started talking npcs town everything made sense fair warning region system artifacts experience experience positive lot play time says played years ago group friends good solid weeks fun ran content sat waited updates updates dried word began circulate abandoned devs cut run uninstalled moved forgotten today found mentioned steam got old account redeemed key steam took stab say changed lot better seen become really disappointed actually got less used progressions cut next nothing short grind cannot experience devs past state game justify recommending game lengthy history cube world alpha tester six years ago buggy errors needed optimization know didnt care enough good game keep playing great time fast forward experience really hasnt changed mean good way know internet hate machine works people recognize flaws game best try destroy shoveling crap developers try get many internet lemmings join process possible led game shuttered six years words effect others living breathing human side monitor people often forget thisyes cube world issues mistakes made one saying isnt true however truly believe game deserves better reception received game beautiful full exploration simple fun aaa title never meant new beginning treated suchso whats awesome voxel open world dungeons craftingwhats game difficulty needs character progression isdifferent quite fun wrap head around game currently needs optimizing polish throughoutthats pretty much strongly felt game lot potential six years ago nothing ive seen far changed opinion may cup tea truly believe fun game worth time price check watch game evolve lot nostalgia game carried far ive gotten id lying said didnt fun certainly ive reached point im rather discouraged game likely wont get many hours anythe big problem lack longterm meaningful progression gear reset every new region best gear regions outside immediate vicinity near found huge problem gives distinct feeling treadmillyou start every skill youll ever get theres progression tools get reset every new region enter gear either similar actual progress make finding artifacts provide tangential benefits arent particularly notable satisfyingits bad enjoy gameplay skills levels mean something gear works every region could find motivation keep playing id feel like im getting somewhere making lasting progressbut cant im treadmill never ends changes gets boring fast point would better revert alpha version played years agoi hope wollay chooses make improvements given pension radio silence nobody know either happens doesntif bought original alpha get free email picroma support go worth hours nostalgia fun stuff gets old futility gets crushing youre thinking buying first time id suggest itall said dont agree hate sent towards developer game regardless current state fact managed two people massively impressive deserve praise hope development continues however long takes end day still think game charm ive found anywhere else lot respect dedication wollay developer game one many play game half decade ago back alpha steam release literally everything different new features really cool exploration important mechanics great ideas well implemented game still lot fun mostly nostalgia sake think game potential great right wouldnt recommend purchasing perhaps future update fix issues fingers crossed could choose maybe rather yes would quite yes love love relationship gameplease understand even without official means record number hours played game lowball estimate spent collective hours past years playing alpha kinda hard find time play im college even hooked game time reali never found addicting game single engaging game ever played reason would stop playing due time restraints put hours civ terraria xbox ive played hella csgo games fun high game fun matter situation level sobriety time restraintsmy relationship game might reason im giving praise devoutly following game previous years rediscovered forgetting years game captured attention due fact lot minecraft youtubers reviewing giving high praise game even within minecraftinfested youtube space bought wollay stopped selling thought inside club people legitimate copies game even insider outsider mindset always held would eventually go sale would available friends buy showed friends werent interested big portion actually interested game disappointed wasnt available purchase sale status reduced normal consumeri say without doubt game fun worth dollars long deal somewhat janky multiplayer experience long enough get considerable accurate sense feelings release probably tainted glassesnote free product disclaimer due alpha key owners getting free

trying invite play filter friends list alphabetical orderwell read far thank remember cube world still beta game currently still room improvement sad see problems alpha beta hyped game finally want note issue hear people talk removal traditional exp system rpg games think fine cube world trying progressing system different way also understand exp system traditional mainstream standard refined many years gaming everyone use exp system hard weird people use exp system waiting years every time posted games progress twitter gave hope hope one day would finally released believe came birthday perfect gift ive waiting long time thoughti utterly disappointed words express disappointment communitys get easily offended pretty good portion rather huge portion itat point would best sold game game development company game future hands likely vanish another years wont even apologize fans feelsbadman waiting actually able play game years getting play worth hype gave massive world region locking colorful atmosphere lets feel like even investing game hours end still satisfied wanting play come appreciate systems new version game equipment generally tied specific zones must carefully pick battles quests feasibly win however first hurdle game finding appropriate equipment tackle challenging quests foes incredible size exploring starts lot fun quickly becomes tiresome fourth fifth time massacred creature wasnt quite field view really look systems online tutorial beyond basic command list press played first public releases many years ago really feel builds fun even respects simpler respects skill tree layers complexity removed thankfully crafting still interesting voxel based upgrade system still present feels combat never ever become complex first times figure elements class outits difficult recommend game right really feels unfinished unfinished game feels unfocused world creatures within beautiful way interact fun interesting sometimes player goals feel like work enjoyable experience hopefully updates alleviated given history developer updates past would surprise picroma completely disengaged another years see another substantial build followed game since alpha wished good much potential years development time version good would recommend purchasing alpha version dedicated website version wolfram please come back craft us masterpiece know create lot fun beta version got boring fast speaking alpha players perspective disappointed wait years update wish wollay updated alpha create entirely new game im sorry writtin harsh bigger expectations beta would look likemy wishes kept alpha hud kept old skills class kept skill tree system kept exp farming leveling system kept old structures like castles dungeons forests etc kept unexplored map added quest log added skill added new structures like beta added towns cities etc added creative building added reasons go explore example traveling biomes transporting items gifts npcs npcs eventually update optimize pvp made gold coins platinum coins use endless weapon armor customization designers animals meaning pet food massive region boss requires defeating smaller bossesthrere many cool features beta small would make big difference alpha example friends list flying friends free hope near future get see points writtin speaking hope yet game responsive bugs beta despite changing anything core gameplay related expect cant change whole game week ill give time vanish face earth well thats ill make final judgement never happy title screen edit expected still good never posted review dont know ever againthis game great experience past still alpha play time timei cannot play beta already havei decided play single zone instead exploring expansive map terrified idea resetting progressi moved different zone hours decided would rather find literally every single inch anything starting zone find equipment important movement tools againi loved old systembeing able progress infinitelyhaving skillbased enjoyable although rather empty gamewas incredibly fun online played friends years ago kept sanebut game feelsconstrictingi cannot progress towards goal game anymore besides finding artifacts improve abilities percentages similar chance find shiny pokemon pokemon gamei dont want explore cube world anymorethere finding unique exciting terrain anymoreif really wanted could fly ends planetfinding nothing climbing speed upgrade hours grindingpleasethere nothing look forward toin game never written actual serious review felt like really needed step amazing work wollay put gamei one guys bought way back alpha version really loved game mechanics put almost hours release clearly see difference alpha big changes wollay said went back several times make mechanics ground release really looks promising course finetuning left overall amazing game play game compare alpha please try long enough understand changes made enter game open minded like bound alpha really think great time really understand big changes wollay made game well thought ofgive try see effort wollay put game typical rpg clue people complaining playing game around hours strait love yes first hour two spent running around dieing trying different classes finally found class enjoyed archer rouge got foot hold amazing world game took also played around multiplayer heaps friend figured could fly one another great agree game could leveling system class dont think holds back game hours played mate nearly completed first region great fun would highly recommend giving game shot get chance go open mind hopefully someone reads gives game shot cant wait see game ends updates keep great work wolly experience alpha anything besides current release really enjoyed game far game lot travel time beating stuff get used little game tells beginning id say two things id say hold back perfect exploration game really feel game shouldnt much flak motivation energy bother review heres short quick opinionsunk hundred hours day im guessing basically im saying im experienced cube world players loved game literally wanted cubeworld quests bosses dungeons fun didnt get instead got poorly designed poorly implemented rework entire game ones denying update absolute trash sucking wolley loved cubeworld broke heart many even like new system simply implemented correctly straight design choices bugs mean intentional design choices quest items spawn certain locations entire progression system wrong opinions subjective isnt simply work well previous systems sad new decent content like bosses dungeons quests locked behind system go anymore details game sense progression art form videogame explain thats original cubeworld one knows honestly even worth completely lost motivation beautiful game played hours beta version cube world would estimate roughly alpha came ive enjoyed versions one main reason exploration aspect different biomes joy explore named areas like huge mountains incredible procedurally generated areas filled enemies quests hidden secretsregarding changes alpha beta understand reason change progression start unsure would work started new ranger character called bert set first region first thing saw group sheep thought problem charged bow ablaze ass handed spawned another unknown area set dodging different mobs running spotted patch started new players next village middle nowhere feeling lostby chance found village started chatting everyone could see map started fill points interest differing colours investigation showed difficulty areai set found volcano strange blue teardrop called treasure spirit stage idea managed beat low level mobs realised gear woefully powered anything green aboveas walking teardrop appeared led cave chest found blue level bow game changer finally could start take slightly tougher areas game opened unlocked lore dungeons really started enjoy game cleared map every dungeon entered supposedly artifacts strange purple force fields blocking areasit turned needed destroy crystals hidden towers one guarded sorcerer tried multiple times even fully maxed gear potions active got beat every time decided take step back think idea climb tree near tower snipe worked turns sorcerers cant climb trees managed kill boss destroy crystal completed first region artifactsi ready move new region knew power would disappear would starting good amount gold artifact gains knowledge made big differencei started slowly new region got town back swing found enough differences generated biome wetland quests really enjoy found huge mountains underwater caves vicious cyclops guarding legendary gear also watched sunset sailed back town pet biter beside felt goodthis game explorers like leave reality behind adventure best way play treat region new game new things see go explore quests require strategy solve helps keep things interestingim sure game everyone would say give go open mind think pleasantly surprised owned cube world since thoroughly played alpha beta versions game turned regular boring rpg level much everything easy stop playing game uniquely styled rpg instead make new character level slightly going difficult challenges every region nothing gets easier makes interesting opinion think artifacts could buffed bit lot people good solutions complaints people however couldnt stop playing game truly interesting think maybe added gamemode alpha style kept beta style well people would probably inclined play theyd choice whether want play hardcore style think shouldnt say bad traditional rpg like alpha version plenty people good time many people giving game fair chance pros consistent sense improvement gathering items always lookout better weapons armor feels great finally find pet system great think features pets could added make interesting already lot detail thought put theyre one useful things game implementation regions different biomes detailed different buildings dungeons awesome music wonderful immersive soundtrackcons need reason kill monsters level bypass anything isnt legendary would like reason benefit continue kill weaker enemies slim chance getting weapon boats glider reins permanent dont really need explain one ocean biome dont want swim island island find boat tutorial needed new players basically impossible know supposed unless look online play game since alpha got say nothing used however still think good game deserves love getting right played game since alpha like wouldnt recommend past knowledge game want try something new give try played cube world really enjoyed even tho keep dying startnow load press play go white screen cut even crashed computer really like game far want play soon hopefully ever wrong fix soon played cube world hours fun perfect beta game built two three people cant complane fun look forward updates game alot potential played cube world dont really like itwhole idea game cool actually rpg game without major rpg mechanics character got almost progression system always lvl thing change gear base gear hard beat even passive mobs actual quests dungeons need look better equipment luckily found epic weapon one altars able clear dungeon get fun fighting dont understand zones system entering different zone gear collected becoming totally useless look new gear also find even climbing claws boat glider cool game hours fun grind one zone without patch adding character proggression playing exploring new zones useless look exactly different biom played cube world almost week bad game problem game difficuilty progression system start cube world dont know anything dont good gear get one shotted almost anything tutorials hell didnt even know get quests game talked every single npc first town yes game hard needs clearer objectives different game alpha another complaint side artifacts reason play game get artifacts hard even worth artifact dont know permanent upgrade breaks region lock rules let keep rest game would cool one thing artifacts useless boost stats like riding gliding swimming would much cooler gave ability good stat enjoy difficuilt games sure give try dont like get refund otherwise wait sale enjoy game things need fixing played cracked version alpha man worse things liked skill trees exp based progression skill system gone replaced utter garbage im refunding game think worth price recommend played hour thing run around trying get beaten bugs much stronger best game played four hours relly like little hard understand first started relly enjoy myselfi recomend game played since early alpha years ago still favorite game date could recommend game much fun get back explore big open world really enjoys new combat zone systems providing game play loop real nice allowing grow power overall play highly recommend great friends great job devs played alpha disappointed well version game steambut believe get better recommend playing iti still love cube world pleaseif game would get developer promised everyone would happy played game alpha friend hyped saw got released quite mixed feelings game though system mechanic changed instead able equip strongest weapons gear immediately needed level order equip wish traveler like pretty hard time loved high gear entering new zone causes gear get low quality rubbish ones quite unnerving multiplayer sections also fixed got way worse first lack performance joining player host always huge delays minutes dying spawn server trying catch also would really appreciate option let friend spawn town thousands kilometres away never reach stuff find quite interesting instead annoying say hate lose collected items zones like riding gliding stuff alright leveling system could still interesting combat though added back improved buuut instead removed entirely getting items feels repetitive zone game still carries lovely theme enjoyably cute looking sounding always found way cute look friend bein chased mobs sorry buddy keep running seem changes mobs immediately chasing sight anymore least distance much shorter dont get beaten every half minute anymorehosting joining server friend much easier going game opening menu click host join new areas music added since alpha carry loving detailsthe quest system got improved single zone makes hard keep running friend curiousity gets better lot little avatar enough make look sweet sometimes absolutely ridiculous feel like good game issues need know beforehand never played alpha might consider changes normal recommend playing friends yet always try could also local issue friend focus zone though want improve feel like moving remember lose gear could get quite repetitive getting items next zone thoughwith mild lack improvement still recommend game put many hours game steam say one best games ever played really enjoyed game lot far lots fun grinding worried whole region locking thing first heard found items use couple areas one got feel way better conquered two areas far im looking forward morepeople keep saying good alpha would disagree game upgraded every way possible even new progression system better take someone played original alpha really enjoyed tiny time frame ive died mean played lmao really funpeople might like new system honestly really fun though havent played much might change doubt game seems get fun difficult gets say liked alpha item region lock good atm also many features canceled say hype kinda killed game fast soon played game noticed game much worse alpha released years agosince hasnt update yet wouldnt recommend game since game isnt could beand im pretty sure game wont get updates future better leveling system better progress system maybe better story would great waited years get love alpha wolay fixed annoying alpha questsno fast travel fixed great thought first glance took deeper look found wolay made game fun old comer borderline unplayable amazing wonderful beauty grind taken away removal level based system frankly furious wolay reading think game would benefit readdition level based system grind would suggest playing alpha instead waited long game release finally thought going greatest game ever played found regionlocking exists disappointment felt time almost crippling honestly prefer alpha lame excuse beta thinking buying game dont game current point unplayable fun like hours loses magic game supposed open world however restricts gear items boat one region dont waste money game waiting long finally people may saying bad good actually play quit playing minutes main complaint region locking even bad wanted game long remember six years ago wasnt old enough make money buy computer could even handle cube world let alone buying game taken websites store kinda heartbroken felt like would never get chance play game even though game six years later still feel way back theres much still desired title many mechanics missing actually game point majority time spent walking circles talking uninteresting npcs cute dialogue noises getting rear handed back silver platter basic enemies latter isnt lack skill either barebones even call progression system doesnt allow player skill even factor gameplay enemies hit way combat kiting npcs succeeding incredibly low chance get better gear leveling experience removed would okay replacement incredibly antiplayer loot system character level based level gear equipped straight fit gameplay surrounding cube world whether player even survive enemy attack entirely dependent whether lucky enough gear drop incredibly low drop rate turn leaves user enjoyment luck rngthis prevented enjoying game case point half hours ive played feel like ive gotten nowhere understandable lack direction voxelbased randomlygenerated open world game today execution subpar always earlier releases much fleshedout fun ive seen isnt game wanted bad six years game sitting somewhere wollays backup files hope someday give us isnt late game fixed havent played much peoples experience pretty clear still needs changes havent really played hour yet played alpha time alpha every attack certain flow even climbing walls felt good beta cant say feelings carried alpha found never getting bored played hours cant seem get play hour wollay know might going reviews feeling really sick stomach bad reviews completely understand anxiety attacks need listen customers want game amazing right doesnt charm alpha didupdate find stuff took almost hours even find dungeon cant complete equipment weak trying find good weapon depends rnggraphics beautiful good decent bad good allgameplay good good meh goodaudio good good bad baddifficulity press easy significant brain usage easy learn hard master difficultstory story text audio floating around average good outstandingprice free worth price recommended hear lot complaints game theres enough content someone content explore countryside level character move next countryside repeat smoothly colored whimsical graphics awesome varied aesthetics skills good number races classes try honest god dont get people freaking game close perfect indie game come long time super technically impressive person projecti guess totally sucks ass tho spent years projecting dream game onto victim large hype cycle give honest shot open mind prefer alpha almost every way find annoying dont ui party members also played like hours alpha total got completely burned multiple times honestly see many people played alpha upset get play time first time player game full release really enjoy game fun exploring go npcs get information certain locations items combat enjoyable like races included game lizard frog etc would recommend game especially get coop buddy join con game confused research level level system many artifacts game gear based entering new area gear basically useless awesome honestly dont get negative reviews problems cube world almost entirely balance issues half everything wollay promised added game shown following reddit yet everyone acting trashed game didnt follow promises ditched game goodwell im tell theyre wrong start playing cube world jump colorful dangerous world adventure explore region progress find key items access new areas obtain new gear help traverse map take progressively stronger enemies progress exploring every place see highly detailed world map combat dynamic nuanced different enemies take different approach fighting cant always easily circumvented gearing max exploring world taking unique challenges different regions fun engaging found staying late travel new places several occasionsas downsides gear crafting purchasing needs balancing reworks fill progression make worthwhile use resources useful tool smooth progression artifact bonuses need progression curve ideally following horizontal parabolic curve rather currently shallow linear progression order make appealing noticeable effect early game without diminishing negligible amounts late game items help smooth jarring transition region next theyre rare theyre unreliable theyre easy obtain highest tier lowest tier meaning theres reason go anything else loss transportation items across regions needs similar mechanic among various balance changesbut game still fun none downsides make game bad limit good game bei hope wollay keeps working cube world think game good lot potential could unleashed simple changes frankly nobody give dreams people arent satisfied progressi definitely would recommend cube world fan open world games enjoys aesthetic game able look past glaring balance issues hours fun hope wollay continues develop game something would recommend even people honestly dont know many people hate new version cube world first yes game changed majorly bad things like region locked items leveling get artifacts help small things make people go away say u god like weapons could kill everything one shot would get boring pretty quick still far better alpha version main game still hasnt changed really leveling system regions still great looking new monsters help make fresh recommend game friends seems encourage teamwork also fun alone better close friends thats got say honestly dont understand amount bad reviews game getting think come cube world alpha fans feeling betrayed gameplay changed muchi also played alpha felt pretty empty alpha duh new version game seems interesting fun played friend mine hours plan playing morei really like game maybe stayed time beta fair years alpha little short beta mere two weeksplease wollay even critics harsh keep working little gem still believe become truly wonderful game tho ffs get team members cant keep working complex game alone already puzzling youve managed build something good alone ill give years development lot honestly dont understand seems like awesome game tweets product end seems like even half game saw region locking honestly biggest thing removal type leveling system xp systems help feeling progression cents honestly feel bit betrayed ive put hours alpha extremely thrilled found finally fully released following game extremely closely come find closed beta wollay didnt make game compatible intel graphics cards rip laptop play alpha fine way discriminate intel users betray long time fans supported spoke highly throughout years youve silent honestly think pretty good game played years ago think massively improved honestly wish could still love game much content removed alpha release gameplay changed much get pleasure playing gamethe entire time playing kept wondering would get better didnt went back alpha wondered hell game went wrongdont buy game wish could say worth year wait honestly wish didnt write review game massive let time waiting updated hope things game go better time bearly give yes dont want creator get another mental breakdown hope game keep getting updates love hope game gets fixedessentially items determine strength leveling doesnt seem mean anything anymore gain artifact adds useless stat swimming speed oh boy youre level entering new region feels like starting new character items region locked items used anywhere seem extremely rare quite jarring exploring longer able use hang glider boat entered another region repeat quests last region order gain game great could explore anywhere actually retain progression terrain also changed significantly seems like interesting features templates havent come across mountain ranges like remember giant ones seemed stretch heavens exploring seems like chore start square one entered new regiontaking account think much game like bought game alpha wouldnt buy price hoped official rerelease game would somewhat like alpha back progressing much enjoyable skill tree gear progression exploration wasnt punished encouraged gain better gear items restricted regions leave region gear founded would become useless quests neccessary items hangglider boat repetitive shouldnt taken away found decided go another region hoped wollay would release fix soonits weeks single patch lets seejudging older alpha footage game much much better state xp system skill tree anything version doesnt anymore get wollay wanted something unique sadly turned south really fastyou got good gear better stay area otherwise useless thats right region locking rpg imagine playing borderlands going new dlc area suddenly legendary gun suddenly deals damage instead collecting artefacts hope enjoy climbing speedthe cool thing like game map instead randomly generated rather get dropped random location gigantic map nomanssky style wollay even got house coordinate game actually got huge revamp would means recommend please dont spend bucks game yet cant give positive loved alpha im kind meh thisnot big fan gear based progression spent like hours probably killed blue mobs get blue weapon class plenty hour farming tons purples getting many items cant use none cheesed star gold minutes completely skipped purple lucky gold wep drop everything easy except mage bosses literally getting one two shot feel like cant complete everything region get hit twice mages im dead half gold half purple armor liked setup progression alpha better like world one better feel like made progress hours like minutes progress progress hours alsoi could care less region locking want able get stronger outside hoping dropin opinionif world old level system levels region specific would still better opinion cant recommend game really happy see released alpha backer enjoyed hell alpha bought bought rpg walking simulator attempts pointless combat zero progression want explore game choose going new region rolling new character well essentially thing progression reason invest time single character unless want really big light radius review wont count got game alpha backer people know certainly game infinite progression enjoy good glad enjoy wouldnt bought game known feel like kind lost way game years silent alpha felt way like complete game dont know much play game feels like wasnt even close enough gotta say one unfortunately love game love game fun difficult prevented friend buying game worth state despite great potential starting pros game still many good sidesprosgreat ost music hypnotisingdecent combat systeme requiere bit aim

incredibly empty boring others nice boring run inside hoursfor game repetitive hard bad way dont give feeling acomplishement first hours playingit great potential cant recommend want cube world ever play wait game years cube world want say ive game supporting since beginning coming back game full release heart warming love yes things different maybe people expected game im enjoying im still first region know basically restart move im loving hope creator okay know gets negative feedback doesnt well know want baby though want start fun game world amazing traverse quests fun however combat progression taken massive hit quality almost point fighting anything except certain quest sites progression ever region locking gearmobility artifacts absolutely nothing combativedefensive stats stats upgrades abysmal swimming climbing shit glider riding really dont anything relic upgrade really hope wollay continues update game hopes becomes something walking sim want start stating game much potential potential many aaa games came lackluster content like destiny etc wow game gone downhill preface experience game alpha player since day came following games development past years many others enjoyed alpha immensely putting probably around hours playing many sessions lasted around hours brother friends however noticed waiting months update lost hope game loved wasnt going become constantly teased wollays twitter years later even found playing got bored finally moved onto gamesnow beta finished full game released tell anyone expected anywhere near adventurous exploration rpg hoped could playing today instead feels like wannabe legend zelda horrible mechanics drab movement overpowered enemies sense accomplishment whatsoever rather fun game explore friends go far away lands search challenging dungeons worthwhile loot stuck home region unless want start furthermore many interesting mechanics alpha taken like spirit cubes fantastical upgrades weapons alongside regular wood iron cubes even skill tree allowed interesting ways could upgrade character climb ride fly faster normal alongside slew mechanics alpha amazing teased content past years wollays twitter mostly nowhere found leftover game files would like tell replaced worthwhile system alpha full release level artifacts give small upgrade lamp light radius glider speed swimmingdiving speed increments lamp radius upgrade increased glider speed etc whereas alpha leveled fighting enemies got skill points unlock skills skill tree upgrades artifacts leveling gave increase strength allowed venture world full release experience even exist skill trees taken replaced ultimate move permanently start game cannot upgraded made better way abilities also stay shift ability right click middle mouse never upgraded way staying completely static disallowing diversity games classes subclasses per class equipment bought hard earned gold alpha replaced equipment find world fine realize cross border explore world hardearned equipment taken away goodbye glider boat reins etc rediscover meaningless repetitive quests make walk across kilometers land able equipment hour ago also hardearned equipment weak starting equipment even worse find equipment thing weapons allow leg next regions however far rare work neighboring regions finally point progression system game get artifacts give lackluster meaningless upgrades traveling abilities weapons equipment taken away move next region spent hours conquering difficult dungeon previous land point travel ability upgrade cant even use equipment anymore point game find artifacts level dont even make stronger give special abilities whatsoever point fighting anything moving new region losing stuffin end game changed triedandtrue method experience leveling terms vertical horizontal progression horrible mishmash flawed progression ideas worthless gameplay could rate game today would say nice game exploration fun gameplay fine beat first dungeon find nothing new interesting without starting could rate alpha wollay teasing past years would much closer offering lot content explore fun gameplay infinite fun friends many years come cant get want know played game five hours played alpha upwards hours ill try make simple write prosmixedcos compared alpha general feelings tldr never played alpha give shot wait get mans sky treatment future updates game large shallow puddle wollay trying best give time figure things way works communitypros graphical engine much better runs smoothly map marker system much better like zoom mini map though markers could easier see map maybe add black outline make slightly bigger zoomed quest system works better stumble onto questing way often exploring like use spawn points fast travel points way enemies interesting uses game crafting fun interesting bioms explore intuitive crafting system normally spawns near town give easy quests things unique cube world charm bring lore factions actually reasons talk npcs quests see saymixed xp stats skill trees skill tree whole zone system interesting concept see many balancing issues whole map shown fully generated without need unique seed loot based progressing system really weak start hud simplistic prefer traditional information packed hud goes lot rpg roguelike conventions hud game systems mini map could improve looking like old version functionality new versioncons times feel completely aimless sense real progression loot loot progression system randomized dont map uncover already fully shown clearing map fog makes feel like youre something right lot loot drops wont class loosing mobility items cross zone always especially exploring islands real reason explore beyond bordering zones lot crafting items recipes compared number items problems world gen buildings inside dungeons cross zones making impossible beat spawn locations far making ur walk boss minutes long sometimes bring back old spawn system use new system fast travel points quests marked easy medium way harder start would nice given items craftingweaponsarmor completing quests towns world gen less detailed varied ex tree typecolors town size layout making harder get game way keep track quests real quest lines types quests must haveplz official modding support modding keep game community alive decades take lot pressure community devs community already fix made game better look skyrim stalker minecraft fallout many gameseven flaws would still recommend game someone hasnt played alpha wants experience something interesting fun friends played alpha maybe wait bit new cube world still fun still charm compared alpha feel work progress game breaking bugs lot missingchanged features one would expect rpg roguelike probably due wollay scrapping half game months release great potential though like mans sky needs good team testers feedback dedicated support though updates addresses community issues im going continue play alpha keep close eye gamejust dont hate wollay much hes trying best make vision come true also trying make game everyone likes give room breath im sure hell come back address concerns dedicated community know lot people hating game currently massive changes took place years updates communication devs get pretty clear lot people prefer old way progression alpha standard experience level based system personally still enjoy game played probably hundreds hours alpha like lot people enjoyed new system different dont get xp items used progress move around faster region found exploring world npc telling get artifacts region youre move next one loot becomes obsolete new zone items boat spirit bell found nothing carries new area essentially start fresh artifacts find give small stat increase carry throughout zones however small problem artifacts dont appear increase ability damage duration movement based stats disappointing isnt end worldi major problems find items pretty easily within hours grinding exploring im taking dungeons area system works like rpg essentially traditional rpgs best gear beginning zone help endgame boss game gear still behave like essentially treating new region harder difficulty really major difference games abilities start people prefer unlocking abilities time fine doesnt mean game terrible get startthe biggest problem release game devs explaining much leaving player figure everything works managed figure things quickly others may need guidance totally acceptable however devs gave tips launch beta mob difficulty based color dont think full tutorial necessary controls easy learn better descriptions open certain doors buildings dungeons neededoverall game looks stunning back years ago still plays similarly expecting content years yeah wont lie little disappointing make current content game bad least still lot since havent touched game years feels like brand new experience love game currently look forward spending time know features removed stuff changed think game awesome like remebered know playing fun game know back story game development know happened disappeared said leveling system changed probably worst change ever game needing time release need need people help devs required help finish aspects game regionlocked gear something need help onliterally reverted back leveling gear based level star level item worthless youre fighting level everything feels like level get gear also needs small tutorial taskline give idea everything game offer youre going strings attached gameplayfix theses add game nice game enjoy friends right feels like someone holding something forced release game cube world wanted isnt cube world fans wantedthe game good missing something every game usually recommend developer needs hear feedback get change stuff nobody wanted changed know reviews game mixed lot complaints going around enjoying would love see changes players mentioned classes grinding otherwise willing put current status game awesome give commitment like hours grind beginning little tedious annoying dont good rng game amazing play friends beautiful landscapes defeating bosses almost always drops good gear continues progression area looking fun laid back adventure solomultiplayer game definitely good one looking forward future patches like make game even betterps btw want start game like absolutely broken op make character wizard dps actually dumb attacks fun know game came lot hate however think absolute masterpiece worth time know review one positive id like state didnt play development dont know changes id like start feature bothers region locking gear feel like gear wasnt completely voided whenever crossing regions wouldnt big deal friend finished region started huge hassle getting anything started next going taking highest tiered enemies hard time even damage small beetle next region frustrating personal opinion criticism game id like see small tweak even gear power reduction although seems like huge deal see added otherwise love game ive enjoyed hours game besides one hiccup launched game spawned ocean biome happened beautiful land generation previous version islands small flat pancakes opened map already discovered every ocean biome looks disappointing also happened fish ocean completely dead sincerely hope sort bug like aspects new version im gonna give positive review new version lot flaws wollay doesnt update tweak game goes hiatus update review negative one like get items want go new region also yellow items new region uselessfrom hp dmg add levels make every region harder harder make legendary gear legendary common dplaying friends might make repeating grind fun alone neahupdate found keep gear regions find example iron gloves anything end name like like like like like made yes like like like recommendations community think itll solid game like hope put old skill system game like casting vote ratings like like like know people upset region locking implementation artifact based leveling instead standard experience leveling still thing game great potential great play friends regions still huge plenty explore moving disagree people saying game lacks feeling progression get new armor region obvious enemies fight ones cant favorite part game killing enemies getting new food items using get new pets havent much time play yet update opinion game changes note bought cube world around believe played alpha like sure feel region locked gear kinda makes sense basically enables exploration direction without numbers get bigger like many games feels weird maybe thats ive never seen done beforeive seen comparisons loot based progression games like terraria minecraft yes better youll never feel like lost progress even stuff still gets harder around cube world could definitely still use tinkering department still enjoy purchased back whatever year first offered alpha release son definitely enjoys watching play offering theories certain things way thats makes fun kid name pets decide let using location map visitthat said boss fights dont feel right inability anything damned laser mages gets grumpyi dont know worth bucks fun far hour mark still discovering things like itsure things make game enjoyable like region block level progression game still fun maybe changes would better like bringing back exp system something similar everyone including loved im one people played alpha version changed lot still love picroma hasnt given game like levels customization character debt pet system skills game none exploring game even beautiful graphics weather either day night ambient definetely alpha better like many others waited many years game like many others disappointed game waiting least one waiting game years still feels incomplete xp completely taken game honestly feels like alpha extra bits pieces truthfully large let hopes game think time finally let cube world rest heart game would never like alpha zone lock mechanic shit locking stuff get hours gameplay one zone pretty bad get another zone need get everything get decent stuff game pretty easy progression degression like art style gameplay elements need changed like extrem additions added alpha version love exploration matter far go theres always enemies fight loot collect fun would much like friends get hands try playing multiplayer like game fun especially playing friends sure funyes understand people disappointed due massive potential yet utilized plenty waited years like even though understand negative reviews even less every alpha player even value money nowcurrent downside negative reviews boil lack rewarding progression feelingjust put also right progression artifacts bit climbing speed light radius whatever little bonus time amount feel rewarding sense progressioni think main issue comes simply lack communication last years degree understandable people lacking experience community management sure good gamefixes main issues quite simple good redditsteam posts like artifact skills equipment progression finding example addtional gliders rather unlock region prestige system meaningful levels overregional conflictstory many quality life improvements would get workshop support point ideas community would solve itselfso recommend game simply due reasons enjoyed far every minute hours play time bucks hour fun seems quite fine developer said still wants add specific elements game work thought current state already enjoyablechanged recommended last point statement continued development deleted blogpost leave like see actually like game im going lie would rather turn back like alpha still like im blast friend playing like game much sucks beta game leveling system liked took leveling beast person map really like find like kite boat rope ride pet good game needs updates would good game really nothing far like game endless challenges done whit area move complete area simple fun although difficult understand start give time understand becomes fun lose gear pets items like potions stay dont lose items cant used different biomes found think like dont get bored good armor wrong like game think people dont like comparing

everyone people would play wolfram remove region locks make separate worlds maps obscured fog exploration thing againgame okay shit better alpha like version game alpha version strongest weapon area doesnt mean strong another area kinda like region lock system however prefer tutorial start kinda hard beginner region lock system shouldnt apply gliding boat well enjoy playing game like liked lot lvl system think region thing dumb liked everything game alpha lacking stuff sure super entertaining gamenow nothing super dumbed version former self main game mechanic relies bdoing thing againb without type progression sure theres progression every region region done theres nothing left bstart absolute scratchb another regiontheres thing gear super rare makes gear also work regions bbut theres way knowing whichbthe things keep artifacts increase utility attributes light slower use oxygen underwater quicker gliding quicker ridingyou level artifacts literally nothing number theres stat increases anythingin short enjoy thing endlessly without kind progression game liked leveling system got keep items thats gone kind ruins whole excitement years game liked loved actually dont feel like playing anymore liked ultimately stopped playing problems regionlocked gear fun game explore find different tools time started new region loved visual design enemies pets landscapes envisioned game would enjoy seeing new landscapes fighting different creatures collecting every pet finding every food etc wouldnt get old really didnt get old got frustrating areas couldnt access get equipment needed access areas couldnt access equipment locked areas realizing way finish region without cheating modding maybe finding artifacts regions eventually getting back one seemingly brokenmy enthusiasm ground halt honestly enjoying three weeks didnt feel cheated felt disappointment enjoyed game could tell things hadnt tested werent likely fixed im sad couldnt continue enjoy playing liked alpha liked alpha played quiet lot like comments suggest beta lot wasted potential cannot recommend liked alpha liked old cubeworld like new one people complain region locking prevents locked friends hop join friends without overleveled outgeared sure isnt convenient system hope skinsaving system implemented still look great favorite gear matter regionlocking takes old grindwithoutsubstance gameplay loop

gear travel doesnt need slog bugginess ai lots variety still needs make regions feel truly differentdont go expectations anything like old cube world typical levelbased rpg explorationdriven adventure game fun combat easily worth liked original whatever liked start game continued cant really love like alpha release im little upset whole game got stripped way repetitive zonesbiomes little story get ok dungeons ok challenging wish old skill system kept stats reset move different zonebiome feels punishing rewarding old skill stat system bioms would adapt rather descale user biome overall liked game start didnt get feel alpha right rather would go back playing alpha sorry say wollaypicorama fked overall love cube world played since alpha games dev disappeared selling bunch copies would get torn apart cube world kept playing hoping finally alpha players review bombing game alpha build let explainthe alpha build vertical progression game fight monsters get levels get gear level fight monsters rinse repeat started random world generally hostile creatures travel packs pick fights carefully die things like squirrels seriously squirrels worst beedy little eyes ahem sorry dont know came anyways youd level aimlessly explore find dungeons level get gear die lotthe released version reviewing different beast yeah still die lot dont even think attacking squirrels spent time crafting finding better gear longer level traditional sense vertical leveling swapped legend zelda horizontal progression system talk npcs learn things tackle fights order choose yes find loot gear still vertical progression overall region horizontalthe map structure changed well instead random maps one game map mapnos infinitely big functionally least every player starts different region candy hundreds thousands kilometers apart order play friends join game use npc fly anytime change region gear goes storage start part people issues within rpgs progress new area shiny new gear last dungeon shopkeep boss etc starts feel like old gear monsters increased difficulty force need new gear thing happens except nothing made harder start back functionally serves purpose also means one come region join fully equippedif take game like rogue lite explorative open world rpg works great find plus gear carried well artifacts function traditional levels goal find carry perks next regionall works game legitimate fun get plenty time best friends game tough really breaks stories build along way running forest night accidently finding ogres dying panic friend feet away laughing got agro hes fine right find love cube world progress cut want experience game funi hope changes soon make review positive one love cubeworld lot fun however dislike region locking feel like take game would much better love everything game except region locked equipment restricts true exploration biomes although get permanent buffs region done dont really appreciate swimming speed weapons gear inventory items vanish took step leftgear count false progression prolongs true grind gameits beautiful game good emphasis exploration currant equipment restrictions really irk cannot recommend unless dont mind gear reset everytime want go explore world beyond play friends love game love wollay good game love world looks map game play love love love love expected still love playing love greati probably grow bored month two two days ive played hours feel got moneys worth love love itshure things could changed like boat cross border stay boat get gonesome artifacts options maybe base dps love love love game personal view game dont like shove arse anywayi love fact game actually hard easy kill mobs cant stand move allyou need doge need run actually use potions healing items fighti love every zone harder fact mixed level mobs everywhere kept toes dont get killed yes zone harder making armour worse still better started need work gain better armour thing making mobs stronger except way easier code make way less bugs would loads numbers screen otherwise arent happy change pretend next damage health see literally exact thing problem see game artifacts give levels arent powerful enough think add base damage base health artifacts would neat also removing ways transport doesnt make sense could keep ways transport buff artifacts would make perfect game love playing family learn game mechanics start playing zone becomes fun keeps mind busy hours recommend people watch videos stream see like right different game alpha loving much exploration hope devs add things future love rublox love running around seeing world current way game cant bother working get good gear lose leave zone dont mind high level stuff time run losing gear every new zone isnt id want love sailing spoiler cubeworld spoiler love developer never gave project im really happy continued development nearly years waiting said game waiting pretty much knew gate going like game nostalgia thats still true many things changed removed even game years agowhat going developers head introduced region locking removed old leveling skill tree system game progression aspect stats based weapons enter new areas stats get completely reset ive played three hours im still level goal anymore youre supposed find artifacts essentially replaces traditional leveling artifacts crazy difficult find find increase base miscellaneous stat dont affect combat allthe old game goal purpose gave incentive play theres nothing progression removed almost entirely please please bring back old leveling system skill tree hope developer listen criticism fix game know must disheartening hear feedback fans putting much effort game years hope understandable final product looking said think really cool developer give keys alpha supportersim definitely going come back game region locking removed traditional leveling returnsit would great least option steam beta settings switch back alpha version love artifact system holy crap remove regional equipment add skill tree make infinitely scale want gods sake love artwork overall look game however gameplay live expectations fell short love fact theres life cube world long since updated really appreciate getting steam key despite immensely enjoying alpha version cube world cannot recommend beta versionthe removal xp mystifyingly bad decision opinion used could kill higher level mobs level gear based one remaining quest first zone spawned character hp last mission one npc hp constantly oneshots barely make dent killedso leave zone gear zeroed essentially start scratchi mean cant build sculpt environment cube world exploration add penalties games root playstylewhat remember cube world alpha heading random direction exploring would pass biome biome finding new creatures tame new sites see nights pitch black needed get city find sleeping bag stuck eventually would get lamp lamps different rarity levels specs press f turn lamp youre apparently already carryingi really dont feel magic alpha featurewise gone dramatically reverse thats shame love game waiting dont listen negative comments bum hurt like every rpg play think differences refreshing beautiful game one problem game heavy processor play games light laptop hope optimize game really get stuck well done wollay pixie fantastic beautiful game love game really needs skill system progression without feels weightless coming someone whos played beta cube world cant recommended old fans previous combat love game ive playing quite lot cant stop wollay pixxie nice job deffinitely recommend anyone love game yes perfect yet hopefully wollay reads comments brings many updates fast one update per months fast cause really save game dont mind biome locking makes grind even harder plus gear one thing wish better artifacts actually give something good character cause boosts gives small dont even notice itbut like said enjoy game lot cant wait see updates hopefully come soon hopefully wollay listens community well real critics ones yelling sucks love game love game love game following years tutorial helping new players didnt know home work game love game pick game play pick homework find play love game best game disappointed love game like miss old aspects game feel artifacts gave swim speed would bit better unfortuntly love ya wollay got wrong time love game great leveling system akin terraria total open world love game since good little worse wollay reading bad comments hell feeling bad wollay read review means never give game lot potential work love game far love game much holds special place heart always one favourite games time love game heart waiting years completed cant stop playing love game really stuff added removed let zone gear lock stupid able keep gear adventure game sure artifact system cool really start gear go new zone keep small buffboth new old cube world flaws play game hope inprove bad reviews love game fog covering screen see absolutely nothing wait minutes go away love game mainly even good game agree needs content region lock kind stupid still believe deserves positive review rate game would give dont buy game gets better buy cautious negatives love game waited years get hands steam copy id say well worth wait thats say without flaws though game definitely needs better reward leveling think boats probably transfer regions love game super difficult really great experience would recommend especially wollay ends adding better reward leveling love game love game ive playing prior steam release different thats ok easy move slowly explore get strong enough take bigger challenges stuff drop like sack potatoes makes satisfying come back later revenge nothing obvious handed either adds satisfaction discover something interesting feels bit old school love excited play family releasedhonestly easier im sure would enough content keep playing hard time putting love game bought alpha six years ago loved played since game may even put favorite games list definitely would put excited gamesbut sadly version fallen short removal xp leveling system makes fighting almost enemy main overworld completely useless also region locking makes game feel repetitive boring right cannot recommend game keep checking see changes get made changes wollay sticks game change review right twenty bucks worth love game unique mechanics work lot people want game like changesfor one rather province skyrim tamriel imagine skyrim unlimited procedurally generated amount skyrims thats concept wollay working onevery region adventure loot special key items end region get artifact level move onto new region start new adventurevery cool unique concept imo loved cubeworld ever since even drastically different still love cubeworld game hold hand really immerse order full grab lore story world progression system needs little work comes regional transitionas far progression system goes could work well instead player losing stats enemies become stronger like become etc like alpha instead go would bring back infinite progression get stronger monsters keep getting strongerand definitely lose sailboat glider reins mean wow completely sucks instead turn artifacts upgrades alpha got travel device could upgrade travel devices skill points obtain glider boat etc enter new region find another boat upgrade existing boat like making go faster glider longer mount movement upgrade also happened leave first region without finding boat glider etc always get another regionthese simple changes make leveling completely enjoyable even still find flute harp treasure stone etc every regionoverall game beautiful soundtrack awesome game play actually enjoyable please work progression system good starting point needs little work yes recommend know wollay dev continue working game feels right loved years ago still love nowpros exploration rpg rewards exploring neat locations explore music good great voxel art fun character abilities smooth controls gameplay skill rewarding gameplay easy start coop endless difficulty pet dogcons region locked travel items forcefully slow progress little incentive fight things outside points interest lot walking map fog war weapon customization feels useless fights feel impossible even proper gear single player friendly overall levelling feels unrewardinginbetween dying penalty crafting rarely worth region locked gearedit still stands cannot recommend game developers abandoned still feels like early access loved alpha loved alpha love could improvements sure game still already great absolutely region gives hours gameplay even go slow problem fresh start time still plenty fun honestly confused people play short time get upset start couple hours gameplay hours long max stats would probably lot upset current region locked gearas suggestion think good simple improvement would making travel gear reigns boat hang glider climbing spikes nonregion locked still available region instead artifacts upgrading speed things finding new regions versions would increase speed travel items artifacts could boost base stats minimally instead much game change would allow bit easier travel exploration actually boat across ocean ride border nearest village make artifacts bit impactful going new region personally like weapons wearables region locked give meaning moving region region loved alpha played hours years checked twitter reddit discord updates cube world couldnt excitedoptimistic sadly disappointedthe alpha content game current state region locking gear removing xp removing skill trees removing hotbar removing underwater fights making ocean infinitely less interesting things make different game alpha cube world anymore disappointment game salvageable cant see ever good hoped would current state wouldnt recommend game worst enemy loved alpha game everlasting feeling impermanence towards work beta huge letdown id completely fine regionlocking exploration game artifacts highly coveted actually something make ride pet faster something similar sort change game make work feel like genuinely matters cannot recommend game loved alpha version game played replayed friends amazing game sure needs things added improving gear zoned move different zone core great gamefrom playing alpha version see great things cube worlddont take plebs voting game giving fair review try loved alpha version tried love version instead getting really cool update taking game next level got new game feels like alpha plus game barely anything alpha game feels really empty beaten first biome beat next biome restart zero really annoying play biomes different biomesthe potential game high hopefully fix loved alpha gameplay good thing dont like rastart get new biome understand makes game basically infinite endgame endgame alpha rewarding would even one early game difficult loved alpha definitely like alpha terms progression wish better alpha sadly looks like modding community might able fix major issues people game dont know long last dont think game worth money yes copy alpha loved beta game loved loved isnt even strong enough word describe much enjoyed beta realm possibility apparent start game truly overwhelmed good new game looked like going even better wasnt matter hard tried enjoy first world eyeopening enjoyable felt like original content first reached new world realized different horribly game taken turn wasnt fun anymore exp removed super repetitive thus game isnt would enjoy pains say dont recommend loved game back great still great whole artifact system flawed makes game never big goal little baby steps forever loved original aspect alpha lot changed beta approach leveling gear needs work though swapping areas nothing tiny boost meaningless stats doesnt feel satisfying lot fun however since allows maintaining difficulty explorationmy one request would update alpha nearbugless state allow players revert alpha beta going properties game selecting version want play betas tab way allows people enjoy legacy game maybe add steam multiplayer alpha people dont deal portforwarding loved game hope game developer well loved game first came much potential back reason got changed kinda messy grind resets whenever go new biome shame man damn shame hope change review future loved game first came alpha state love game however agree majority public say newest features arent exactly way wanted new leveling system isnt exactly wanted level scaling isnt great either still love game play even knowing flaws would want everyone else things like alpha beta first alpha didnt reset gear every time went new zone spirit cubes fantastic think need brought back anyway wish say wish great gaming experience loved game loved game become mean like starts get really fun constant state improvement beginning game hard going die often dive missions suited gear improves gets really fun game time going traveling although wonderful soundtrack comes along provides sort peace mind cannot express words travel lands far close different areas begin emerge playing different soundtrack adds gameplay overall would recommend game looking chill yet fun sort game play friends great pick would describe game legend zelda minecraft mix mean said already thousands timesalpha cube world thisi would loved alpha happens dont communicate years learn mean kinda fun problem get lot progress lose mean im enjoying weird development design choices overall still interesting game mean better friends mean yeah sure downgrade game alpha might unpopular opinion thoroughly enjoy game think exploration fun yeah price little steep type content youre getting overall joy play might minority im enjoying cube world stands im type player wants repeat experiences microupgrades equipment basically chasing power level ultimately means nothing due lack end game wanted id play cookie clicker insteadmy goal playing game see every biome offer tackle every combat encounter thats designed appreciate unique builds course tame every pet possible version allows arguably quicker beforeim hours ive conquered biomes time ive done ill likely hours clocked thats money well spent think price per hour compared media like movies etc empathise people want old alpha system back aspects build id love smoosh together create sum best possible happen long wollay isnt dissuade blind rage somecombat fluid skill based aim projectiles think positioning visual aesthetic gotten richer dropin dropout impressively seamless making playing friends easythis im optimistic new improved versions could way miss alpha also enjoy current version come hope see updates future glad supported game alpha cant wait see big things waiting future game interesting kinks choices make feel unique game satisfy players game game enjoyable community developer miss alpha comparing alpha version literally definition chad vs virgin meme wollay really fcked game alpha great dogsht honestly miss old rpg system hoping update instead scrapped favor new loot system feels like thrown togetherthe skill trees ditched large bummer enough variety skill sets enough spells

special buy change review game stands serious scam people denial sheer nostalgia nostalgia even defended wollay twitter twice currently game worth price asking worth defence getting never played alpha fun far give chance maybe updates soon never played alpha neither beta dont care disappointed full release game really good need balancing sort tutorial super fun im glad thank wollay never say game absolutely horrible levels gear like trove gear nigh impossible get starting game nominated game storyrich game joke game story oh rich recommend game case youre looking mod changes made steam release unmodified unlock tool traverse world like hang glider boat leash ride mounts even weapons armour get leave region none still available works zone region large theres probably several hours gameplay first region get second walk border new region back square one unlock relics boost base stat everywhere could hours work healthremove restrictions mods like region unlock uarishackstv youll get life set region center move harder things become thatd add challenge multiplayer stretch game bitproblems still exist however lots items pick world cant use certain classes play mage ironcotton balls become useless youre unable use upgrade unlock equipment doesnt tell youll gather stuff cant use time frustrating happen friends play though reduce chance epic drop get sold bugger coins later onit fun need know kind experience youre getting play friend recommend game mods find alpha version game web new progression system ok doesnt really give anything completing region mods change get relics fix see going game sad see fall little flat game still great doesnt really give hr game play hoping beat first region got bored mod game keep going note devgame super fun think needs little work sorry hurts know baby spent years need tweeking needs better rewards relics takes good amount effort get end dosnt feel worth started playing long singleplayer stand point fun thought feelings rng based game fun play game multiplayer horrible system get randomly chosen spawn may turn friends worlds apart eachother another problem game hard start without much information may find difficult level first levels many low level mobs spawn able level fast game become extremely grindy system game promises improves rng style systems spawn difficult mobs around may sound like complaint believe game huge potential become great game right early launch quite appalling disappointing half expectations since initial alpha launch originally came game hearing good things alpha excited wasnt able get alpha met dissapointment game actually released around hours play id gotten first artifact travel new area nothing carries doesnt feel rewarding anything artifact boosts minor anyway theres help theyre eitheri found bored didnt really feel like playing anymoremy final verdict go fucking play trove originally got game back first gained popularityyou know meme skeleton sitting computer thats waiting updates game finisheddo buy game never done say maybe developers one day change opinion instead go play trove originally positive review im changing negative reviewthe good game looks beautiful music great little variety gets old quickly combat seems new skills added nice respawn points great addition game new npc types new creaturespets new buildings quests dungeons etc minibosses lore added game bombs usefulthe bad updates since release fixes mp exploit artifacts next useless zone locking really messes flow game especially using boat travel cant find weapon night time dark cant really anything since cant see foot front forces go town use inn hang glider completely useless making land travel slow npc ai hasnt updated easy get boss stuck tree corridor building etc dont care new crafting system removal crafting items majority community would rather alpha version game back instead current releasethe unforgivable made change review positive negative lose respect wollay pixxie since supporting game first came communication since release single worst thing thing devs could done expected since wollay us past six years deleting blog fb accounts removing planned update website simply amazing leads believe people wiped hands clean game causes also lean towards notion took money ran believe well hear believe update game anymore originally defending wollay mental struggles bullying events listed cannot defend anymore manup dont let sticksandstones get support product simply lost desire even play gamethe uglythe community went one least toxic becoming toxic gaming environments ive ever experienced discord steam forums went shit least reddit somewhat tame sad truth probably mostly adults acting like children platforms people ashamed grow tfusomething look forwardsome great souls making mods change gameplay completely small qol changes devs lazy fix past years hope game continue hands people since devs disappearedfinal notei highly recommend skip purchasing cube world dont reward developers like download alpha enjoy true experience cube world thrown together haphazardly current disaster currently supporting developers like sets bad precedent gamers originally positive review planed game current state cant rightfully recommend cause dont think like playing great alpha still see find way get play patiently waited years hoping game would one day come new content expect entirely different game game design fundamental level work region lock makes absolutely sense place game like game matter personal vary much enjoy game yes things enjoyed alpha game lot charm mu son enjoyed playing vary unique game play unforgiven start challange quite enjoy could use little fine tuning things could improved really continue enjoy playstyle art style many hours come one things miss ran across huge boss would often tear ground leave destruction path made feel really careful personally believe better got course still flaws biggest one progression really existing artifacts seem games main objective dont really help weak make difference somethin easily amended reigion lock good gameplay addition imo makes replayability better players keep boats gliders reins switching regions however overall enjoy game right personally dont like region lock overall still enjoyable especially friends personally like game never part pre alpha initial release game watched many videos streams understand people coming gets old aggravating personally like difficulty aspect game absolutely love new leveling system work progress game made developed along patched bugged total two people great would recommend anyone loves rpg like games course theres still room future updates dlcs thats gets excited dont let negative reviews get keep working pace theres always gonna two sides people dislike game others like absolutely love personally like ingenuity come design ever challenging thing id change little custom ability leveling lore ties world story progressing zones personally really enjoyed even tho first pretty much fuckes ass play fun yikes new update bad dev vanished like issue solve want recommend cant played alpha multiple hours got chars lvl played beta guess share honest opinionwhile alpha flaws considering lvl progression difficultysystem alpha things rightplayers able improve characters using skill points felt like u become stronger u playloot fine distributed early game like lvl felt pretty good u noticed flawsmonsters either challenge nearly unkillable efficient way lvlgrindplay get quest defest roaming bosses reset time againalso world alpha felt quite empty dungeons pretty much always thing changing regions also didnt really change things dungeons looked pretty much every regionthere quests less aimless wandering around creating challenges gothe beta things better gives clear goals lots quests every region world filled enemies strength ranges start fresh character barely beatable totaly possible beat wich great logged first loved hard difficulty game presents youthat progress gear balancing benefits makes game really hard start super easy u got lucky drop time skip white green gear directly aim blue itemsi like aim reset entering new region feel like reset bit hard keep pets good think shoes glider boat carried wellalso id like collect stats leveling gear loose wouldnt feel punishing also provide greater goaloverall like direction beta taking alpha build think way go changesadjustments madeim looking forward great future game played alpha released say liked good rpg game didnt stand much gamesnow year counts cube world finally admit nothing like alpha buying game looked like alpha disappointed however buying game adventureexporing stle gameplay might enjoy iti enjoy new quest system leveling quite unique mean try name another game leveling system one would like see enemy scaling state game either getting shotted basically invincible controversial topic like region locking gives challange got bored aplha hours nothing worthy fight anymore change would love see reins hand gliders boats wouldnt region locked kind kills funin conclusion looking beautiful adventure game endless biomes explore friends would recommend game played bit alpha true game taken strange path although think game still fun played lot alpha cube world almost everything made old one good removed find download alpha play instead even stable version crashes often well played lot alpha version game using pirated copy guess paid thank wollay alpha actual game played ton alpha really loved excited come disappointed everything great alpha stripped extremely unenjoyable mechanics like region locking getting rid traditional leveling mechanics completely ruined game unless lot improvements made zero desire continue playing game played ton original alpha enjoyed linear generic rpg progression current system regionlocking feels especially unpleasant sail across region border character dump boat ocean longer know sail boatthese systems need fleshed explained theyre going feel good player definitely work progress world great systems fleshed made fun itll great perhaps wait purchase played loved game alpha game progression changed lot find type gameplay apealing others game still feals like beta needs polish progression might need tweeks played alpha beta lot great times playing game years agothe beta difficult alpha version get kind frustrating times first start playinghowever think progression system really unique adds level difficulty progression many enjoy though ive already gotten pretty used already enjoying game thank wollay great game played hours sense consistent progression whatsoeveri enjoyed cubeworld alpha literally sparked fun played hundreds hours outside steam want put positive review support wollaywe love dude negative angry people never accomplished anything lives mad changed game bitmuch love friend played region hours got pet reigns used ride pet need leave current region lose everything worked forim basically starting putting time reason satisfying fun anymore played alpha game went viral changes made released game questionable making almost unplayable due lack progression played game fun couple hours add couple mods like cubegression cubetravel cubepatch game gets pretty fun highly suggest play game mods played since alpha personally think game wonderful take things take account dont like grinding min maxing etc play casually fun friend two hours upon game hand information expect figure stuff mmo even really rpg adventure action game go wanting get crunchy numbers wont good timelast thing read negative reviews youll find two kinds reviews genuinely dislike game state want constructive change spewing hate wait years game expected taking sides saying dont take every review full face value played alpha betai honest game perhaps good idea region lock equipment full potential original region got artifacts items permanently boost utility stats needs changed rebalanced lotregion locked equipment retains use end neighboring regionswollay dev lot plans years ago really good plans scratched sorta like started game bad requires lot polishing get good strongly recommend wait couple updates intends upgrade game otherwise dont buy recommend another voxel game like trove perhaps hytale comes xdscore played alpha disappointed gave game fair shot think game fun hours however first clear region starts feel aimless pointless due fact one region loop reward completing loops artifacts increase mobility small margin affect combat opinion enough reward fact become stronger equipment equipment gets reduced nothing new region means youve basically beaten worst game throw one regionunless enjoy sent back amounts level one every region mobility increases gained permanently character work specific item region eg reins boat etc random chance spawn region artifacts wont even anything recommend game september played alpha back enjoyed game thouroughly version game lot stuff replaced gameplay wise lot people like personally way game right allows exploration completion factor great love games region pretty satisfyingunfortunately gear one region usable another region im sure might changed someday wollay updates game frequently small changes bug fixes believe take consideration everyone asking recode features teasing twitter past yearsi believe game eventually become looks like tweets right hes making sure works together perfectly fine add new feature back bug fix feature added edit wollay ditched us longer recommended kept original review seen played alpha well hours ive played beta currently meme moment shit game please dont let stupid people people barely played hour try sway opinion gamethe game fun combat fun exploration fun classes different enough change way play game still fun dont know creator wolly went quiet years years people started harshly negative bash game one man team wife pixie work well isnt company behind game two people best game fun hope wolly stick keep updating game ignore memers want tear game fun ive got worth like exploring looting bit grinding youll enjoy game played alpha quite bit first came loved game time really looked forward thought might become new version definitely wanted playing many hours ive decided really like incarnation well love collecting exploring region locked gear make every new area new place explore careful beginning learn progression difficult get powerful weapons armor new region ive collected artifacts far dont know help weapons armor hopefully collecting enough new regions become easier easierim working father husband game easy pick play short time without relearn last time able play played alpha death adult played full game much many us buy games graphics neat game fun dont get core gamebuilding concepts care debate game cute fun easy spend hours exploring terrain still large enough learning curve exciting adults sure improvements make happen coming weeks months release solid use played alpha loved played release still absolutely loved negative reviews fair points release deserve nearly amount negative reviews received game much fun havent enjoyed game much playing long time hope developers continue add features polish house building function character customization ui could use refining positive experience whole definitely worth buy played alpha amazing game waited like ish years update whole time waited knew game abandoned mind update finally comes however pretty disappointingit feel like years went game game actually less fun alpha right nowi hopeful game gets fixed becomes great guess wait played alpha years ago whatever reason game removed profile website bought steam played long realized point playing game whatsoever dont level region locking hinders exploration wouldve happy originally promised didnt play much cant speak much new systems time fight anything im gonna benefit fighting found avoiding enemies running around people might like new system wollay implemented cube world lot potential quite since wollay gone silent doubt therell improvement time soon youre fence game go reviews saying save money buy something else played alpha years ago review im attempting unbiased keep mindits extremely hard look game like objectively sensational development surprise comeback recently trythis game undeniably certain charm one games feel compelled wave npcs beautiful artstyle incredibly atmospheric timesit isnt easy defend games shortcomings really doesnt give much direction could certainly learn love tell depth significant amount content surface level hard reach bottom line dont regret purchase years ago really dont lot reasons shouldnt end day im glad bought think youll glad thats positive review isnt kind developer see issues game take money run im sure many issues experience addressed pointtheres good chance youll like game feel spending justified sincerely believe played alpha personally found boring past hours playtime beta got free figured id try actually pretty fun much longer time alpha understand kinks progression system need worked like making artifacts significant interesting overall see regionlocked itembased progression much enjoyable biomes also need reworked like making oceans visually interesting boats prevent freezing ice biomes still beta however consumers expect problems games beta long stuff like fixed release game problems played alpha ive played different enjoy played alpha finally getting chance try game sadly disappointed core gameplay loop hasnt improved progression feels meaningless would write longer review think fair review game deserves would randomly generated oneedit ingame map fantastic though played alpha confirm current game different experienced back made lot alpha players angry arent major changes whole point alpha stage development think lot people dont like current release simply different genre roguelite rpg doesnt mean terrible game sudden shift style could lot smoother devs communicated better last yearspersonally enjoy alpha im enjoying current release areas definitely need polish adjustments eg region locked glidersboats foundation great game already place props developers actually following releasing game didnt played alpha loved game much fun exploring leveling combat finding awesome gear customizing gear soaring around glider probably hours alpha exploration real purpose world map wide open real reason explore see fly anywhere leveling done artifacts seem grant minor perks movement stats skills unlock gear regionally locked leave region venture another sweet gear gathered uselesscombat good wasthe game lost made fun longer sense progression longer drive explore fight droves monsters gain sweet xp unlock skillsmake ones unlocked even betteri sure happened development really hope dev bring magic back game make alpha cannot recommend game played alpha quite bit playing like going updatesthe alpha fun lacked real end game game became stagnant easy right gearthe beta potential lot replay ability understand needing set back leave zone really hate gear useless mechanic like direction game pushed mechanic think game needs sort progression system feels rewarding want see unique quests toooverall like think lot potential almost completed first zone hope game doesnt feel repetitive one zone complete played alpha several hundred hours loved progression system enemies scaled level approachable could actually explore groups mobs random level destroy loading new world still copy alpha click run version loading compared years later sad year old version fun played alpha shortly releaseand ive enjoyed game since thenthis latest group updates amazing genuinely hope actions trolls unhappy children hasnt scared wollay away continuing make updates publica beautiful game exploration enjoy friends played alpha exhaustioni bought game new releasei liked progression looplook past negativity game still great played alpha version back fun game awhile felt really shallow lacking content also poorly balanced however needed expanded upon would fantastic game unfortunately isnt happened six years later game changed fundamental level better im even sure could call game rpg anymore bjust things noteblistskill trees removed game nothing replace levels experience removed game skills unlock none gear interesting simple stat upgrades passive abilities hit effects anything like every time leave region gear gets taken away reason fight enemies strength level enemies every region game never gets harder first region listyou also collect things like hang gliders boats moment leave area gets taken away reason find game justification either completely baffling collect boat one region try sail neighboring ocean boat bdisappear im riding b game chock full things like feels like developer trying waste timethere zero progression mechanics beyond tiny upgrades movement ability take hours get im talking things like sailing faster swimming faster etc ibim kidding form permanent character progression game bionce youve played hours youve seen everything game offer reason go different regions gameplay fundamentally thing real progression varietyi could keep going every single confusing design decision game wouldnt really add anything game isnt fun consider cautionary tale developing game complete isolation outside feedback years may bad idea played alpha years ago heard id get free beta access well full game free excited finding core features game stripped away disappointed honestly think wouldnt gotten game free wouldnt even play someone paid money mean like something like played alpha would suggest fixing hud adding leveling let us choose seedand make dungeons frequent put map marks walk without even like alpha game potential please something played beta hours feel like hours deserved game sad pathetic husk alpha feel like worked years maybe couple months fact lose equipment going new zone one stupidest game design decisions ever seen hours played game feel like basically accomplished nothing even find artifact would gotten pathetic boost useless noncombat stat anyway go new zone start process basically like made new character way improve characters combat stats reason wollay decided remove experience game played game long back alpha kind feels like played older worse version game hope make game fun somebody figures way mod game back alpha new buildings stuff wollay obviously isnt going fix gamei disappointed wollay played crap original alpha version cube world pirate unavailable purchase missed ability played friends got high leveled almost classes warrior missing excited found game released days happen people feel possessive game good reason original alpha taste game lot potential current version feels similar stream lined good bad played every class almost completely max gear yellows better starting areas quickly realised one form grind broken larger form grind instead grinding levels going broken dungeons randomly generated hunting world bosses loot grinding special stones upgrade gear something different new system main game play loop comes gear progression questing killing monsters talk npcs wandering towns gain locations quests information tell places get vehicles glider boat climbing gloves remove stamina requirement climbing instead leveling stats skills everything relatively increased based gear equip crit gear make particular classweapon combo build work better alternative regen haste stats enjoyed system though miss able get elemental stones upgrade particular stats gain effects particular enjoy rogueninja lots haste regen double dagger poison two handed blade fun right clicks ninjutsu really good engage tool long actively dodge attacks use right click key moments gain crit next right click mana fun active play style combat quite different depending weapon youve selected available choices class two available specialisations take part rogue assassin able stealth every fight properly geared one shot even starred monsters different mobile ninja engage handle fight like knock knuckles right clickso get access full class kit constantly change weapons swap specialisations game gives lots room try different set ups easily wish form long term progression tiny bonus movement stats though quests enjoyable certainly appreciate technical challenge creating much random generation scratch game doesnt enough long term hook huge shame consider much fun could built gear went la diablo gear actually depth robust crafting systemi think game worth dollars even get sale wollay doesnt deserve lot hate gets people feel really passionate game good reason clearly something right one man originally meant pet project people begged release game basically simplified randomly generated voxel bassed skyrimzelda hybrid game interesting combat real long term character progression effectively infinite quest generator fun action combat wollay decides add progression somebody mods game masterpiece game certainly everyone played game lot back alpha stage game still great fun play definitely enjoy playing would recommend others try played game release since probably spent hours playing one promising games ive ever played couldnt excited full releaseso bought instantly moment came big mistakei gave version chance really alassuch huge disappointment like backstabbed dear friend played game last week since bought alpha waiting six years worth would say game still finished main problems game game design seems like wollay decided start threw things already alpha like exp skill trees favor significantly frustrating item based progression system would problem item based progression system normally poorly implemented region locked progression doesnt really make sense hang glider boat cross region line disappear also poorly balanced starting extremely difficult start white enemies easy quests hope good rng rewarded better gear actually fits class game either way easy way hard fun game played one region knew wouldnt want play unless going start another class lot content alpha quests areas markers map huge improvements game falls short bad game design core honestly sad maybe future game improve possible wollay may change gameplay everyone dislikes maybe combination alpha betarelease game design problem seems like item based progression progression even levels anymore dont even anything really affect way artifacts items get keep besides plus gear affect stats like ridinggliderboat speed theres really nothing keep going levels anymore would able get another skill point get bit stronger thats gone tldr bad game design much item based progressionbad regionlockbad balancingbad contentgood played game alpha beta completely different game underlying problemthe biggest issues artifacts next nothing gear get one region worthless region unless get item little progression game essentially value rest map regions pretty small speaking map map everyone random theres fog war completely explored defaultthe alpha addicting traditional exp leveling system rpg like skill tree add top unexplored map theoretically endless things find loot kill youve got dream game gone hasnt replaced anything meaningfulthere lot changes people like like two aforementioned points think main issues honestly artifact system conceptually great fresh idea dont value think still exp monsters skill tree artifacts bonus stats wollays biggest mistake working alone cannot program alone guess got new fresh ideas like artifact system getting burned alpha game got hyperfixated changing stuff completely transformed game wanted alpha content instead got disappointment got refund played game realized region lock thinly veiled obfuscation lack content within gamethanks wollay im happy waited years thisi suppose ill region lock playtime game played original alpha heavily first came elements original gameplay miss reached endgame quickly became repetitivei love new version allows sense progression area retain original feeling levelling without endgame overstaying welcome heavily encourages exploration sense adventure played original hours beta type thisalot people complaining region lock believe nice way keep playing character maxing equipment best stuff region easily oneshot almost every enemy locking game would quickly become boring keep open mind try look things positive way tons classic rpg games perks trees play absolutely hate thisedit changing review recommending might change laterthe reason game isnt seeing updates changes content run dry something happens review stand right played game years ago alpha build honestly changed theres region locking equipment thats far positive thats less meaningful change find nowhere near enough content warrant price point untrustworthy developer seemingly drop game moment extended period time want similarbetter experience time money play breath wild trove minecraft played game years ago alpha tried first time week ago wollay changed game quite abit since say alot fun alpha beta really nothing work towards current build removed skill trees lvl ups leave zone start start gear accesories got first zone useless next zone go game poppin steam atm wollay swimming money anyway idk something since took years changes played game back im happy playing couple issues right hope fixed later edit fixes came played game back alpha found game fun couldnt figure progress lvling system grindy enemies brutal stopped playing never much funthe beta game steam completly different progression system based finding itemsgear area leads game loop getting better gear fighting area bosses moving starting fresh small noncombat buffs think prestige bit unbalanced atm potential alpha imo somebody works designing games making games see much promise new system different every game able succeed changes probably lots negative reviews people expected beta alpha dont buy game want play alpha waiting till alpha wollay decided go different direction dont like spend money elsewhere one love new changes flawed may still enjoy beta played game alpha thoroughly enjoyed playing every minute ended quitting thought game abandoned heard getting released steam excited played beta got even excited ive consistently playing every night friends im currently level rogue ninja theres something fun addicting despite people raging sure problems base game extremely fun engaging played game hours still like understand game everyone refund played less hours dont like played game hours uninstalled dont plan ever play againthe quest system cubeworld quite boring much different going dungeon clearing even quest besides cant even see npcs might quest youonce enter new region loose equipment even movement items pet becomes weak become one shot anything except weakest things hp also didnt seem increase better equipment equip unlike region tamed inand loose movement items change regions would want use goal getting artifacts pretty pointless thing increase effectiveness movement itemsyou unlock lore regions finding small pieces lore seemed pretty generic short uninteresting even sure lore randomized notyou teleport revival points unlocked already must say least something positive gamethe combat seems quite bad special thing really dodge roll positioning cant even command pet attack removes option use pet make distance enemys strategythere many different pets tank pets dont evne seem much hp melee based pets limits usefullness tank especially loosing hp region changealso keep mind others buying game many years ago developer became silent didnt deliver promises gave supporters promises better skill tree instead existing skill tree completly removed promises rare pets none pets seen yet also many promises werent delivered yet many yearsbe carefull buy game already completly meets expectations dont expect game updated even get promises dont buy untill updates actually wish already added played game alpha years ago alot fun play together othersa lot changed since still feeling plays nice hard sometimes simple fun changes still made creator hard work give time enjoy progress game makesits fun movement super nice combat pretty good looks nicei recommend play together others really different played game first came alpha years ago honestly feels like good quality features taken replaced new unique features dont work rpg dont feel point leaving zones reset jump going nothing overpowered fast hours struggle completing quest getting lucky mage mechanics got staff insanely overpowered killed bigger mob got another better weapon min later im already highest tier weapons played game years ago first iteration released let tell game magical six years later whatever im gonna look magic simply gone cube world fabulous game changes made progression pretty much ruined people old days played hundred levels played till level play levels though amazing system losing progression area ridiculous losing glider boat reigns also absurd combat definitely better classes actually little fleshed dungeons fun personal favorite thing addition items like harp unlock parts map however changes worthless progression changes losing progress pretty much nothing painfully unfun overall ruins experience played first came didnt want leave review answer back hints community dedicated game even subreddit awful alpha felt vast lifeful dungeons looked felt like crawl something hardi want say outright buytry etcgear region lockedthere xp systemlevels arent tied making character strongerstarting area exceedingly tough lot promised features game game gutted wasplus side lot explore doesnt make lack inbetween progression really needed thispurchaseplay risk played first released years ago fell love art style game playsure new version changes heart still really enjoying playing played years ago really enjoyed potential developers seem keep vanishing game isnt great current state ive heard install mods get play time havent tried cant comment personally wouldnt buy recieves steady flow updates pretty much enjoyed actually cant wait new content come purchased cube world girlfriend release much enjoyed earlier iteration game since reluctantly refunded writing review level class progression obtaining xp power character determined gear loot gain exploring starting region wouldnt huge issue gear obtain one region didnt become obsolete moment enter another hope one day reverted want enjoy game much potential best bet would hold buying purchased alpha version game six years ago wollay announced game coming closed beta also announced purchasers alpha would recieveing key beta excited lots talk going game wanted see changed alpha knew said changed lot played alpha pretty regularly year sorta felt likewell level challege left game expect bosses overpowered impossible defeat quests beat without effort great run lasted well worth money spent really liked reviewing alpha different core game mechanics reviewing version betafull release game version different different doesnt mean bad reading comments reviews entered game little nervous almost immediatly killed cow lol like oh wow weak seems lot harder remember played figured new mechanics game work ya know whathonestly really enjoying know many disagree think game well done like game mechanics stand including region lock played game around hrs masteredconquered biomes completely character steadily gained progress travels love design keeps game fun exciting doesnt feel boring like starting enter new biome like challenge rebuilding enter new biome like surge excitment running away stronger enemy kick butt also love feeling satisfaction find special items beat harder quests defeat artifact

lion devildog hope types quests added artifacts instance could fleshed id like id like see battlesobjects like circle power gain power defeat region covers maybe surrounding biomes youre see direction going world endless therefore artifacts well eventually ill way better diving still hope wollay plans add things future wants ideas ton shareloloverall id give game strong scale room changes improvements game good stands well worth opinion purchased alpha thus experienced game beta still core good game decisions made wally removed almost progression game thus interest playing game cross new region practically starting something simply need purchased game back right would recommend game fun time however one two game loops take anywhere depending lucky get gear drops really worth continuing playingits alright game dont get wrong however waiting years sparse updates developer im kind disappointedalso another thing worth mentioning game windows supportso make sure hardware compatible beforehand purchased way back released game back levelling system longer working via experience longer talent tree would say skip states game rpg like exploration works would say wait salei would recommend worth put least hours alpha excited hear getting full release wanted developer removed leveling system instead putting skill points things actually want use able customize character find artifacts weapons work area currently completely discouraging exploration bring leveling back abandon awful artifact system game would worth lot price tagthe alpha better put hours alpha enjoyed enjoyed beta toothe beta flawless require pretty big changes become masterpiece everyone expected however still pretty fun well worth measly costs tbh gotta bit big old whinger think game worth get didnt meet expectation owed waiting years game quite like sure progression bit iffy im confident devs work something theyve stuck long dont see abandoning really appreciate game ive played beta hours ive beat first region came knowing region resets gear artifacts give minor buffswhich need improving got dive stamina reduction first one treating region like mini adventure defo way go playing game personally treating like region new save file mini story enjoy replay value friends enjoy gameplay tooi would like meaningful buffs artifacts except im content honest lot games days give hours literally game infinite replay value appreciate lastly away random generated world boot map zoom much get scrolling youll ages maps big youll never get took hours one easy region really cant say didnt expect something like still im disappointed time go find alpha pc somewhere really cant recommend game region locks really killed game dont find fun get characters items reset every time go new region change review fix day really desperately wanted love steam release ive played game picroma purchase since release would happily play unfinished beta version interesting maybe couple hours realize exploration combat gated stages find lvl weapon kill lvl mobs lvl weapon lvl mobs etc version cube world insult even beta finally quit large dungeon generated way made stretch different biome since character progress deleted explore new biome weapons armor basically deleted boss room want love game ive seen however currently aint chiefedit really want change thumbs im still excited see game

lock regionadditionallyremoved option dedicated server present alphachanged progression regionlocked loot including boats mobility tools water levels especially awful manually swim island island find another boat specific region unheard rpgremoved multiple abilities per class instead opting long cooldownremoved xp leveling completelymultiplayer suffers bad rubberbanding issuesprogression early stages game consists getting one shot everything really dont get negative reviews especially people played less five hours much issue game isnt like alpha anymorethe progression system changed instead simply killing mobs getting xp find relics raise level also raise ride speed swim speed lamp radius etc fun start somewhat fresh every new area would boring one set legendary equipment first hours gameplay kill every enemy one hit alphas system mobs unsatisfying feels lot balanced still challenging loot system improved simply helping supplier gnome get good gear class reason isnt issue start new every area tricky get better gear doesnt even take hour get good stuffguess problem players dont understand first really enjoy cube world love open quite enjoy running across terrain killing stuff go hope future additional features feels quite empty clearing region two could much would nice see features dev showed twitter within past years classes wider range quests would perfect cities would also great see areas map especially ocean biomes hopefully see added soon really enjoy cube world really love much new things explore join friends big difference power think classes balanced also feel

hours full release thats really type game really love game way works region lock allthere bugs think little bit still crashed game made impossible go certain places fixed region lock play first region find gear work next region help find even region travel towollay said going updating game launch things isnt end cube world updatesedit wollay apparently working game community discord pictures dm picture skill tree levels really love game whole heart removing exp region locked items infinite game loot ruins game endlessly grinding goal reward aplha goal would getting levels exploring getting best items dont even wanna explore world know walk one direction lose hours time reasonin short removed purpose game fun factor hopefully game gets fixed reccomending game state really love game hard start get hang start enjoy play hope game keeps evolving future truly become masterpiece potential years ago lot potential today wellthe thing really miss alpha skill trees hopefully theyll get put back game point dont hate direction game going think new mechanics still need work im really loved alpha younger ever since ive following game since heard going get another updaterelease excited beyond words especially following wollays tweets emails videos beta dropped however seemingly large lack almost everything weve seen sure theres things like grand arenas dungeons quests lore many many new monsters itemsthe issue game lies core mechanics seemingly lack well alpha mechanic present almost every single rpg getting exp leveling able put points skill wanted every level felt like getting stronger every level outside equipment good game would able fight stuff higher level gear able utilize skills well beta doesnt though star rating equal terms weapons hit like wet noodle mention gear isnt level one shot basically anything ingame tutorial give info skill either wing find buffs certain classes get would like know basically anything want level progression back bunch new skills drip fed years least somethingcurrently sort leveling system game based around getting artifacts take hours even begin start getting per region unless youre lucky gear drops rich ill get mean per region artifacts poorly thought system think ever seen rpg getting artifact means upgrading utility items yes im talking skills talking lantern radius could buy upgrades alpha boat speed hang glider speed pet riding speed stamina depletion upgrades amount equal dumping glass water swimming pool barely noticeable need many artifacts even becomes slightly useful whats even worse affects things get per region goes final gripe current beta systemper region item locking gear get per region locked region includes weapons armour hang glider boat pet reins instruments used gates stuff get keep crafting materials money pets foodpotions imagine walking shore beach sailing nearby ocean boat magically disappear right underneath basically forcing either go flight point get somewhere ocean jump water whole kilometer get anywhere could also imagine youre hang gliding mountain next region sudden youre dropped sky sending spiraling ground die fall damage outside two get weapons armour needed gotten every single region makes tedious work unless money go buy terrible gear shops small saving grace still laughable gear get makes gear usable defined amount land around makes getting artifacts take insanely long actually go around grinding random random source get gear spend another hours getting gear get riding speed whatevermy final thoughts game follows like cubeworld honestly cant justify purchase basically anybody major changes made core systems really fun punished game wants go around explore id really like see return leveling system skills mean something hell could make areas scale level farther go something artifacts need something least let choose im upgrading get one since useless please least change glider boat region locking thats least could build shown late looked best thats got hyped funif major overhauls go game ill give rereview im going give negative enjoyable way alpha really really want love game fact skill tree removed leveling nonexistence compared alpha makes give good review come removed reason ityou promised features never came really think people leaving extremely negative reviews either havent played game enough simply dont know gameflow actually works game designed playedclear regionget good gearclear final dungeon find artifact better gear allows domove next regionthis increases replayability youre getting bored cause constantly finding new items getting new pets exploring new regions system perfect things wolly improve game needs progression little bonuses artifacts enough needs direction lack direction communication think contributed outrage game ton fun even flaws please dont see region locking assume game terrible many people game beautiful lot id recommend giving chance really think game lot potential back day still stands currently wouldnt recommend anyone unless feel like burning cash patient people im sure folks heard whole region locking thing havent really boils key items glider boat must found region work picked armor weapons disappear downgraded starter gear outside obtained region fortunately gear easy find useful finally problem gear works kingdom every region surrounding region got outside useless yes may take time finish entire kingdom assume start farming gear outer regions kingdom forth long youd like keep exploring monotonous feels antifun hurts honestly id even call system punishing degree know wasnt intent idea behind region lock probably keep game infinitely playable unique idea merit merit could easily multiplied fine tuning im sure wollay pixxie knew would result community backlash folks dont like idea time essentially going drain dont think thought itd backlash degree though cant blame people upset enjoyable mechanic momentwe level although im entirely sure good level represents many artifacts youve found one level per artifact artifacts relatively useless buff things like climbing speed swimming speed boats apparently ones buff lantern radius havent seen yet none means cant fun means every time problems come kind sullies good times youre making remember much fun could theres nothing stopping friends rolling scary mix rangers mages making nearly every enemy game quake boots except enemy mages one shot thats fine always bound balance issues things first come biggie think things started way alpha wollays top bugs though thats good although id lying said happy staminaless wall jumping got patched first day lol jumping sheer cliffsides fun lasted least last probably biggest gripe alpha dogs savage dogs able tamed biggest tragedy ive ever seen really want game fix wollay come back reality hes probably going run money good game think thats fine feel free buy im warning bored within hours sad see game complete uturn wollay great dev doesnt listen community game passion project past decade pretty much understand doesnt listen people sometimes usually better idea try see people want though anyway game still potential wollay ever return could easily fix lot annoying features completely bounce back doesnt seem likely please say something let wollay know way possibly really want love game region lock could know could better hope cash grab scam really want recommend game loved alpha death beta disappointed beyond belief many things loved game removed exp prominent feel like ive completed particular region im starting game due region locked items really isnt good feeling assume players enjoy game first hours really loses charm realize youre starting basically beginning travel new region gripes version cube world ill leave really hope game doesnt get review bombed angry fans think game needs constructive criticism feedback else really want recommend game remember playing friends years ago absolute blast think game people would absolutely love none friends really feel way every time leave region start literally exact game even finding artifacts supposed permanent level increase ability climb swim sail glide ride thats great expediting process finding artifacts process problem dont want speedrun game dont even want play moreto summarize ive played almost hours yet find reason recommend game really wanted game good since good games friends could play many people excited game including friend skeptical game dead years coming sudden kept alpha good luck next time really wanted enjoy game wollay removed everything excited way progressing grinding new gear monsterscrafting thats thats game right every time go new zonecurrently waiting refund really wanted like game really remember cubeworld first appeared youtube inbox big names time inthelittlewood big youtubers middle school im adult getting ready college years ecstatic saw wollay releasing game steam launched game wasnt improved alpha state game bare bones recreation cubeworld region lock skill trees removed full empty promises recommend game good heart anyone current state wollay fixs game state enjoyable ill gladly change review really wanted like game explore different types regions go dungeons really isnt much else game developer released game one heard anything since like game alpha ive pretty much lost hope game wouldnt surprised game didnt get updates really wanted love game waiting years really wanted love game say im disappointedremoval leveling system gearartifacts tied region destroys whole experiencethe music pretty good least really wish could give positive review game current state cant progression needs completely reworked less repetitive new region system artifacts need impact progression level ups actually something scale character stats mage enemies gear level need nerfed desync issues multiplayer need resolved really wish could give positive review honestly didnt wait follow games development years get version missing features made get first place feature roadmap got added years get removed last year development years instead got abortion cube world knew really wish could say game improved since alpha current state really hasnt im still keeping hope get better keeping hope faith wollay hasnt misplaced really wish would bring back level system upgrade paths also wouldnt hurt abilities overall pretty ok although personally think fun play back alpha everyones bitching region locking thing dont find huge issue really really wanted love game hundreds hours alpha version couldnt wait silence broken potential realized none happened wolfram still distant customer support community updates toss suspicions cultivating social media limit negativecritical newsfeedback game hey whatever man world renderingview distance bugs leave character wandering fog never problem alpha content sparse progression region locked repetitive tiered resources arent nearly common justify tiered crafting system much less crafting system first place problem never happened alpha still hope game much anymore put plainly alpha testers dissapointed wollay long dont care anymore looking next thing beta got announced back looking really really hope see development game time goes stands though hours beta alone mention time got alpha last six years thats per hour fun beta alone ill putting time friends easy recommend could one best games year development keeps really really like game exploration alone drew game originally spent bunch hours alpha game different upon beta glaring issue poorly implemented armor progression system really put huge damper game overalli wish could recommend realistically cant got really bored quick really really wanted like playing alpha least hours unfortunately time versions dev scrapped systems made game fun order change progression flawed system region locking currently playing regions see reason continue artifacts receive characters relatively useless nature without levels determing gear get lucky weapon drop immediately makes zone trivial seems like region locking solution typical rpg problem god everything lower level bizarre power spikes every zone doesnt make want continue annoying fact travel items region locked well outside progression numerous things dont understand couldnt improved upon years ui windows small size cant opened unless standing still basic tutorial explains repeatedly talk every npc get quests unless go ocean biome every island point interest towns carbon copies biome specific styling classes total skills whichever specialization youre crafting gear doesnt seem purpose unless youre getting good itemotherwise current owners game still fun least zones recommend trying ocean biome plays like miniature lozwind waker themed area anyone hasnt played yet youre missing anything recommend cube world heres whytldr enjoy game better alpha version first came years ago realize exp system grinding gear instead lvling annoying however opinion exp system back alpha version didnt really make huge difference took long time level spend points talent tree basically get free version like idea moving different regions getting different gear different game offers tons explorationthere basically infinite world spawn regions part world get gear artifacts region however want explore new region without completely clearing first region spawn lose gears value power new region unless get gear mark meaning take new multiplayermultiplayer makes experience even better lot friends world destroy everything really quite enjoyable lot hard dungeons mobs take time gear combatcombat interesting iframes rogues stealth classes cool abilities class specializations changed near town mages teleport short distance even heal youre water mage making pretty useful hard fights recommend play friends funny game pass time crazy shts recommend game better trove recommend gamewhat likewell crafted landscape interesting encounters combat tuned balancedwhat dont likeocean biome needs work artefacts could use buff people complaining region locking without understanding top tier gear time would trivialise content every region removing sort perfect easily worth price remember loved game much little bought waay got released steam say alpha fun wasnt complete least entertaining game huuuge potential wasted minute saw got released steam literally freaked played steam version beta game felt emptier felt alpha happened game sad really dont recommend game anybody many better games prize one goes remember finding game years ago looked couple videos pretty intrigued playstyle minecraft like graphics early september friends talking gonna play cube world digging found game id itching try since day found yesterday decided buy give game go despite negative reviews supposed downgrade bad compared alpha beginning minutes kind puzzling first since never played cube world minutes felt like getting hang game started exploring clearing areas friends finished roughly session still felt like bunch areas explore region although majority might make argument region locking ruins progress made area see addition content game offer adding tons playtime wish powerful set equipment every single region explore tldr id looking play game since come despite bad reviews couple friends decided pick anyway hours playtime still felt like bunch content go continue play cube word simply great game give shot block previous bias go blind ready experience game offer remember getting game back alpha fun doesnt compare fun wollay done fantastic job passion project one things might instantly notice first open game actually music holy shit music something favourite song ive listened far one played grottothe game really fucking addictive really fun playing solo get friend friends ooooohhh man something super fun addictive around nice game settle look side really say game far every time move new zone gear weapons go op zone completely useless mention items collected eg boat hang glider harp etc previous zone vanish find new zone super annoying get use pretty quickly fact find quite fun gear gather everything though understand people easily getting annoyed great game ive pleasure able play early due getting steam key owning alpha highly recommend play solo play friends remember playing alpha someodd years ago game great still great love new progression system especially playing friends allows endless gameplay thats easier newcomers join opposed old exp systemthe new focus exploring new lands opposed endless grind much appreciated change ive played grindy games warframe hours didnt feel right game relaxing going adventure completing region putting game next adventure pretty satisfyingi really hope developers continue update game hopefully bring teased features talked past years game fun music great gameplay leaves wanting explore massive world remember playing game first came still similar back small changes made kind ruined still enjoy game doesnt quite charm remember beta game awesome items region locked feels like cant progress get stronger artifacts buff different regions dont feel impactful mean climbing speed really remember good old days remember hype cube world back day personally super never played release game definitely really different used honestly bad personally really find enjoyable hate pretty big downer new systems different sure thats exactly different couple pretty big issues release arent experience ruining slightly frustrating remember game first thing family bought online super excited back loved alpha much gone back play many times since came always hoping update would eventually come since wollay kept showing promising things update came years later game taken steps forward ways others many steps back alpha showed lot promise really missing depth good gameplay rewarding leveling progression system simple clean colorful art felt like world wanted dive explore full release update added plenty good things id go far say everything good besides region locked progression lack leveling system skill tree like alpha things incredibly essential overall game region progression makes annoyance leave first region anything anything dissuades exploration rather want loss kind skill progression abilities change levels really makes feel like im progressing little matter unless things changed dont see game future hope wollay listen criticisms change game better cause saddens would rather play alpha right remember game first showed cool leveling system lvl farter got youre hoping going get game real person throw maybe figure get good gear need good gear right rong gear get useless go another airy map reset progress saw game years ago moon seeing rpg simple pure one time kinda enchanted fact wasa simple waited waited ready never today bought played first enchanted like first time saw didnt last essential leveling system skills got gone traveling gear reigon find inlike wtf leveling skills gone arent able keep items youve already found remove capable level system skills got finished game like made something removed heart thing thing ever game aimlessly wander around world spam talk every living thing find hope get location run kill something get something cant even use anywhere else level system like thing still making rpg tresure hunt weapons attached iti would say shouldnt bu game unless like wander wander kill stuff fun games gives zero purpose anything world dont buy see lot hate game honestly fun playing brother dont know people complaining mobs hard gear difficult get able get character maxed legendary hours easily getting gear shops sell make sure check back new day buy know wasnt people expected wanted maybe helps expectations going previous alpha experience part miss able build weapons really cool wollay stays active doesnt buckle hate take year hiatus think could turn really great gamehowever feel like much content released game needs know looks like see lot people leaving reviews claiming game empty super confusing someone dedicated around hours past week game tell game think course still worked daily things released still lot current state saw review done guy played game half hour complaining game super confusing game confusing first dedicate minutes actually adventure like supposed start learn people say game confusing sbs need actually put hour game hit hour point game feels natural everything comes easy feel free comment questions feedback best respond give guys info need seriously know game got worse coming steam would honestly recommend game based version played back seriously cant made awfully linear experience instead truly free openworld game started disappoint big sad somewhat wish never happened thanks killing great game spent ton time alpha loved game beta prerelease first found stupid couldnt progress however actually putting time found little easy know fight mid tier mobs blues get go obtain fairly powerful gear quite quickly classes insanely overpowered theres rogue even rogue clearly region doesnt take much time longest part traveling little class balancing would go along waylevel progression needed itembased leveling great without skill tree something makes worth theres reason keep playing sure love getting extra mount speed chances next region isnt even going reins ride pet anyway worthlessregion locked items okay losing reinhang glider etc adds playtime work towards new region however regions dont even half items seeing main reward completing region time upgrade items dumb especially places cant access without items regions dont appear making obtainable regions improve lot thingsmultiplayer tuning important would go along way improve game giving someone option start new character region friend would lovely use gear get carried friend first minutes bit annoying also making mobs reset even someone waiting grave next would nice currently cheese anything long friend sitting grave next trying kill never reset keep coming attacking ult whateverif gets dealt game worth buying however stands aim sale anything probably worth spent hours playing alphaand six years waiting im sure spend lot time cubeworld againthe game offers lot explore every region uniquethe quests well made spend hours one regionthe region lock makes challenging explore new land thing really missed alpha one point nearly every enemie easy killi like idea leveling system artifactsthe thing really miss skill tree alpha little tutorial help getting startedi fully recommend cubeworld everyone looking exploration adventuring gameplus multiplayer really fun spent years playig game would dramatic saying title probably one personal favourite game alltime say update beta version addition game steam store game becamesomething different something fans like played game years werent familiar wollay game developer ofcube world probably lots doubts updating cube world probably lost games concept gamers lovewith simply wrong created version game liked probably gained another type audiencegamerscategory lot people part would probably never know actual reality behind development game ifyou reading wollay sorry think going play new version game dont worry anyway bought itso see like finally spent money spent hours gaming spent older verion really loved work goodbye still find coming back game fun play adictive relaxingmostly negative reviews come fact game different product alpha true game good either way indeed different productthis strongest argument negative feedbacks game please aware troll reviewswith said hope future updates add mechanics would make gameplay even pleasureable like option put fog war map percentile completion region still hope game revived time david sake still love game love wollay pixie disgusting amount fun initial release cube world isnt nostolgia change rating accordingly feel entitled purchased demand anything hope creators see devoted fanbase love original concept become fanatical itthe thing add seen critiques loved world destructable know players could cheese way dungeons bombs seems minor fixable loved leaving permanent marks landscape either friends absolute monsters obliterating towns leaving land scarred epic fights bosses really miss boss fights realize isnt exactly monster hunter really amazingly fun im totally willing flexible design changes creators go plan support future content create spirit monetarilythat saidi recommend supporting creators recommend game bringing friends play version current state fun short sighted taking away key features drew community first placecan haz cube world classic release nao plz still love game even changed levelling system since world quests combat better art style one favourite game wont change give chance new game judging alpha especially aud sunk hours alpha everything thought made game fun even barebones statehowever wallay done full game release made bland repetitive simply boringi recommending horrible disappointment wallay obvously didnt care community making game showed shutting scrapping amazing idea game decided go easier route threw steam easy cash grabword wise buy maybe hours content repeats self tend laidback less critical lenient person consider factor reading thisi bought game way back alpha days really fun honestly still think different kind fun completely different gameplay different style hasnt changed like new gameplay isnt bad perfect bad different many humans instantly dislike things different personally still like dont super like region locking thats livableis game liked skills dungeons alpha version maybe game like style find softcore new game region potentially interesting sure good game alpha cube world thats necessarily bad think cube world come plenty hours game play like getting game knowledge learning everything think creatures charming theres game thought would quests items youll need theres crafting tons exploring played another person extremely easy get world fly combat game lovely controls opinion beef game could care less think worth purchase im happy decided continue releasing game instead cube world staying hidden unfinished forever think cubeworld fun way besides region lock would problem level gear based think everything needed said already saidbasicly happened tldr game amazing years ago game abandonded dev due health issues game came back mentioned years absolutely ridiculous updates actually removed replayability progression dev week listen negative feedback bring back desperate hope play people paid fell love long time ago dev thing released hot piece garbage basicly spitting year old alpha players directly facenew players might find fun hours become bored inevitably due progression nonexistent dont waste time moneyadmittedly spiteful fully biased recommend buying cube world think fun game problems region locked equipment kinda

ironic sort way also enjoyable mods also friends cost less extremely low due customer insatisfaction little content general mods friends say worth think fun charming game progression system kills desire continue playing convince people play dont recommend think enjoyable game updates could really good positive nothing changes change think fun game relax vibe think would fun friends nut dont want play think great game people dislike wanted alpha conntentbut look great new cube world adapt think fun need rework perfect think good beta doesnt explain anything think people blowing changes way proportion yes alpha let explore freely could keep gear level character like every game fullrelease still explore freely going progress sticking region timeive posted forums summarize enjoy way alpha alpha got boring quickly rinse repeat killing things level finally kill things get better gear quest system full release actually exploring region intimately finding things talking npcs slowly getting better artifact obtainpeople still play alpha theyd like im frankly tired changes welcome fun play especially friends think people really reviewing game unfairgame different compared alpha

shoving potentially forgetting first region fun youll get anywhere hours second walk new region youll lose absolutely everything boats hang gliders disappear even youre using second cross invisible boundary get spending hours fighting zone swim speed moment game close worth know something change think game going right direction personally removing xp system mindless grinding fun least personally

disappointment progress system worst feel unmotivated play want believe still potential want keep short alpha player absolutely adored unfinished product cannot recommend buy game unfinished product seems devolved many ways unless enjoy gameplay loop consists running around avoiding enemies come across dying repeatedly aggro enemies stronger buy game couldnt force play even fraction time played alpha hopefully communities concerns heard game improved whatever manner needs game much potential feels frustratingly wasted current stateif youre okay hour gameplay loop hours spent running around trying get loot weakest enemies forced reset almost completely upon moving new area game might otherwise probably notregion lock bs want like maybe one day today want like game simply cant first fell love game six years ago hope hope would develop absolute gem game potential becoming instead stand today game significantly worse pretty much every aspect alpha game played six years ago saddens much see potential wasted wollay hope sees feedback devoted fans game nothing personal wollay let whole process sad culmination witnessing today want like game fact part absolutely adore game controls music graphics general environment everything ive ever wanted blocky rpg unfortunately one terrible downside sense progression lost items region locked leveling system dont think theres actually much game respect wollay pixxie greatly delivering us product able progress outside starting area really makes game feel dull closed sincerely hope taking consideration ifwhen decide update game progression really killing want love cube world really unfortunately game disappointment doesnt meet promises set alpha ends somehow shallow alpha lot promise game progression changes ill gladly change review cannot recommend cube world current state lack real incentives progress makes feel like actual waste time playing game swim speed incentive lack actual leveling gearbased progression tied region leveling grinding doesnt matter long run makes feel like theres nothing left complete first regionif two fixed game would immediately become one top timeit amazing content ideas poorly implemented resulted game look forward development improves game worth following hopping problems addressed want love game ive excited years however playing two hours could already tell game fun may seem like lot playtime first two hours game arent fun worthwhile dont see point return send pitchforks way let explain find game upsetting core mechanics game fun visuals great music controls optimization awesomebut problem game isnt fun one core reason game hard honestly bad design dont mean way like dark souls hard fighting strong enemy patterns dodge im talking every enemy encounter one shot kill know theres whole star system enemies certain colors mean higher ranks however issue unlike traditional rpgs mmos make farther go powerful enemies game friends spawned next group level agro enemies walked us got insta killed quests receive early game high level character instead giving quests based star ranki know people complain region locking loot relic leveling isnt problem problem guide players feels like youre never progressing understanding fightingthis game needs overhaul want love current state im afraid ill sadly return want love game however many problemsthe game play repetitive fight mobs high level gear use region get artifacts region level move another region rinse repeat game hard recommend game grinding gear repetitive feels unrewardingthis game much better alpha stage beta complete mess developmentdisappointing want love game wanted since launch waited years game sale likely created internal expectation would never met couldnt met put hours game loved every moment game polished experience without bugs played assassin solo ran none friends game challenging dont suggest monsters much higher health reason could solo run bosses abusing assassin dodging stunning first grab friends enjoy ride assure willthe game enjoyable game fun areas vast fights variable spent casual week clearing first region acquired gear plan move next one wrong gear region locked go back grind laugh along friends restart end clear region achievements complete end goal sight fight waves foes go region region gripe game sense progression lose progression every area casual game friends would suggest five ways sunday solo run game cant suggest put hours even isnt bad game isnt great either want reason move forward achievement clearing multitude regions big bad boss allows one piece armor regions something pushing forward spend hours made worth nothing hurts demoralizing played hours put first days launch addicted love ready write review saying six years worth wait sat thought everything loved love game hurts much recommend majority give reason play something shadows telling fight without push cant find heart lose progress put time effort want love version game gave try wanted accept going back old version game way better feeling going around killing creatures earn xp level better feeling progression version fun game hours shame considering much fun alpha want recommend game everyone sadly dont think game something im honestly puzzled game different alpha needs extreme work ill best point ways games biggest problems could remediedfirst foremost loot system needs fixed regions shouldnt basically reset line progression isnt starting new game plus sort feature doesnt make want journey first region instead like discouraging explorationa way could remedied simple dont take players items instead make farther away starting region difficult enemies better things drop become things essential travel given near starting region instead opt enhanced form transportation first regions mounts hightier mounts like birds something simple like mule slower horse couple regions faster mounts maybe random chance boat item spawn still found via talking locals reward people explore farther transportation leveled start focusing bigger bosses harder dungeons godtier weaponsive seen lot people upset start abilities need bring back expbased leveling system abilities attacksive pointed two glaring issues game ways fix im certain rest community already done similar post mine overall im dissappointed lack things busted progression systems place game still developed people triple company deserve credit credit due cube world still fantastic run around waste time like breath wild type exploration game surely satisfy long youre ok main reward seeing world inhabitants wherein however want deep rpg massive world tons customization give wollay im sure hes still working game im even sure modding community eventually overall dollars game enough feel scammed im hopeful future cube world im excited see game goes thank anyone stayed read brief review game hope find adventure wollays world find fun game still offer want say like game really waited years game going already feeling bit lenientbut cant say heard takes like hours game get good dont want spend another hour running away toostrong enemies empty world good wanted dont really play games like anymore wanted like game really loved alpha doesnt wanted like game much cant seem itthe equipment get game strangely region locked meaning get epic weapon one regionbiome move different regionbiome epic equipment suddenly treated trash equipment return place obtained fromleveling completely removed though game still says level appear almost completely removed save standard attack charge attack ultimate sets attacks appear different depending type weapon equipped doesnt usually change game play muchi dont know man waited years kind update thing seems lost game play value creator doesnt communicate fan base also claims perfectionist presume wants make game wants fine never know game change much build buildi probably still play bit see change mind im optimistic wanted like games full release like loved alpha region item lock system seriously took fun progression game dont see point playing putting hours grinding gear become useless enter new region youre thinking buying game wait theres update leveling system wanted like game mean really game play dull fast travel system wack movement ungodly slow world difficulty rate scale anyway whatso ever tried playing game friends even none us liked killing enemies early game almost impossible unless find weakest mobswhite labeled experience almost impossible im disappointed game hope receives huge patch soon wanted like game couldntto try keep things short progression painfully slow difficult tried fighting star boss one star gear boss health managed damage got melted instantly one star difference im told fine get better gear issue moving new region negates gear try progress massive gap every time fine games one doesnt workthe game gone rpg rougelike good one compare game rougelike like risk rain much fun see much gap games game made something completely different still trying keep things like confused wants rpg roglike neither welli hope game gets love attention deserves manage turn around ill probably go back playing alphatldrgame lot progression issues longer rpg rougelike bad one wouldnt recommend game wanted like game trust core concepts made fun first place taken example leveling progression system incentivized killing mobs replaced gear progression system isnt necessarily bad way implemented incredibly tacky every single region even plains ice ocean requires different set gear hybrid system levels give base stat total gear region boosts stats would much better imo wanted like game played friends place alpha tell anything progress wanted love game muchbut cantthe alpha definetly better wanted recommend game despite flaws saw pieces good game iwerei unique progression system attempted although didnt work gameplay level could tuned something specialuntil proven otherwise game seemingly abandoned sign development despite bugs remaining rampant content minimal worth unless goes sale cannot recommend current state huge fan cube world first released back unfortunately feel like game taken step wrong direction game becomes stale quickly due lack meaningful progression system reward completing zone small boost stats something relatively useless ie climbing swimming speed starting new zone downgrades gear essentially useless start scratch feels like youre replaying first level game hopefully added make game less repetitive progress rewarding would recommend playing alpha version huge fan game alpha cant recommend version young elf always dreamt adventure since child mom always told stories mighty heroes collected powerful artefacts shaped

ingredients potions game might something youand want wish everyone mean things join hatecommunityhave fun avid fan alpha version cube world assume many dont get game changed everything ive loved shitty grind extra steps early backer game back completely thought game abandoned forgot played game good back alpha dont see anything explains took seven years release matter fact game isnt near fun used remember maybe daughter grown since alpha years ago fun used minecraft obsession anything voxel like right alley bad game could super meh best still excited games future dont think fun right environmentsound design wonderful serene theres lot core issues regiongear based progression great idea increase replayability key items like boat glider removed every single time step new border kills momentum hardcore artifacts could great permanent stat gains right theyre next useless cover things like stamina efficiency swimming riding things basically nullified boat glider light radius lantern really enemy difficulty also bit mess spawn get camped rareepic mobs finding something kill without cheesing takes apprehensive new system big time gear going regions seemed really odd definitely wont find structure like anywhere else ive gotta say actually really fun small permanent buffs artifacts real permanent progression ive found really bad thing like new adventure every region say though miss skill tree alpha like completely different game still love even love maybe traditional gamemode option would cool could either either sheer amount new content youve added awesome keep good work excited game fly around flying longer fun lose glider go new zone discourages exploring starting game literally press every single keys keyboard figure keybinds like made game already knowing keybinds figured everyone else knew minor gripe doesnt affect gameplay everyone else already talked bad excited game came years ago grabbed alpha played friends blast get beta steam gone much character things made good feels like stuff game removed bug ignored put back spawn spot random one character started next super strong super aggressive ogres minutes running like wind got away look town find saw map town would pretty much cross entire map restarted new character wasnt worth hassle start new character get quests go one get completely wrecked mob fine need grind yet cant tell grinding cant see skills used game cant find benefit grinding mobsthis game disappointment compared alpha run hope developer finally chooses listen audience go back drop free start later point seems like ran threw money made years ago needs excited game shame excited see game actually still worked showed discovery queue could get steam key old alpha account huge screw devs sending emails though went start jumped andits game years ago without fun stuff reviews already iterated sucks really suck mean spend years accomplish improving single thing game given game gift really enjoying coop experience one thing bothering spawn point dungeons something simple spawn point first room every dungeon would go long way make experience little user friendlyi also really like game deals moving zone zone makes fun experience trying determine go nexti know ive seen people dont like losing travel items zone like makes zone feel like separate game sometimes feel like character link jumping ocarina time majoras mask link didnt keep gear adventures dont need eitheri think would nice option purchase certain travel items shop maybe random villager sometimes money builds point much nothing spend get next zone would nice could decided buying new gear next area saving hopefully find someone climbing spikes sale next zone happy seeing cubeworld back available steam expected port original slightly changed version got surprise less least feels removed level system replaced item based leveling lot nice abilities gone used weapons feel weak mage warrior little damage besides special ability game still great potential seeing change much worse saddens hope bring back level system maybe expand idea sub classes abilities tree cant recommend anyone playing despite loving game much happy finally see cube world updated hope still give love going forward would love see else bring certainly takes getting used region locked items bad alpha beta people put expectations aside still fun game around knows grow continue grow time could similar mans sky currently still enjoy incredibly disappointed release cube world waited perhaps eagerly rest community thought would much improved version game got gutted carcass game much enjoyed past iterations didnt even run system without patch keep note original versions playable windows one unless install community patch minor prosthere options menu rebind controls alpha lackedyou use wand wizard shoot laser beams like witcheswizards may fought played game alphathere new ways use abilitiesentirely new abilities eg fire wizard make big boom holding shift left clickingthe map fully revealed start meaning always choose biome go rather finding minutes travelingconsthe map fully revealed start meaning longer sense exploration original versions game felt large part game experience alphadoesnt currently function windows requiring community patch even launch said games previous versions could run osthe skill tree skill points alpha gone theyve replaced horrible grindy tedious questboss farming artifact system takes away players choice progression requires farm artifact items give buffs average progression heavily dependent rng god help dont get good random dungeons bossesyou longer make new worlds play dont like one get fact every player exact world yes world procedurally generated however part world truly randem starting areas spawned bad rng make advancement cease spawning nearly every quest dungeon enemies far level deal whopping damage per hitmany items get locked area youre become unusable cross border includes reins use ride pets find new versions items locked new zone entered doesnt seem exploration friendly itthe ui joke excellent help menu available via key displaying every keybind youd need know replaced six little blurbs text bottom left abilities chosen consumable item clearly shown cant see pets friends multiplayer hp bars like alphathere clear indication npcs give quests simply speak every one town given two lines somewhat bland dialogue eachcopied flying fast travel system hundreds mmos usemany things would nitpickssome information supplied friend already past refund policy duration choice explore shitstormtldrthis version took original alpha version gutted sold price first time purchasable years agothis game worth go find alpha version elsewhere developer doesnt deserve money right looking forward game hype really disappointed game fun first party system takes maybe hour friends get star weapons zone crazy easy gear becomes worthless move next zone including items like boat hang glider etc shouldnt reset never able play cube world years ago saw amazing potential bought game today thinking would like alpha tons things added truth game took made game much fun play watch put trash gave us horrible gameplay example leveling exp almost zero items shops biome items good farm best item dont get real fell made cube world great years ago put bluntly consider buying game nothing like alpha happy come im dissapointed combat buy sell items unless game lets minecraft switch versions game go back alpha playing game right one alpha backers game alpha released back one stable alphas remember playing although rather barebones terms content content engaging enjoyable felt worth price even state innow years later lot changed game dont think changes necessarily bad thingyour progression based gear rather traditional leveling system good gear difficult find usually good region found actually find prefer system alphas traditional leveling encourages deep exploration area youre areas nearby rather roaming far wide sticking one place longi also love lore find various regions youre randomly generated thus get repetitive time still believable enough spark imagination world mightve like pastthe repetitiveness honestly probably biggest downside game actual process exploring whichever region youre largely every region fight whitenamed enemies free supply gnome two upgrade green blue etc find various travelrelated items artifacthunting move variety comes different region types explore different dungeon types beat alone isnt enough sustain interest might game youoverall though ive much enjoyed game years feel like worth price end review ill share tips ive found helpful getting game start youll spawn near town figure weapon type like sell rest weapons use coins buy armor andor glass bottles life potions youre talk npcs many reveal quest locations map well level might get lucky get whitenamed area revealed open inventory b default youll see stats lefthand side screen including star ratings weapon armor dont try take enemies higher level weapon rating take stuff higher armor rating youve gotten used controls abilities class youll able upgrade time whitenamed bosses areas drop green rewards greennamed bosses areas drop blue rewards etc supply gnome quests friend rescuing one given region unlock gear next level village shops explore especially dont initially get whitenamed areas first pass talking villagers dont afraid open map scan around interestinglooking unrevealed areas go see whats map also extremely helpful finding life shrines serve checkpoints free teleport points spot reasonably easily zooming way looking white cubes map also middleclick map mark important locations make easier find actually set get friend two play game multiplayer works quite well someone else plan progression help make game enjoyable everyonehope helpful good luck adventures one fortunate support game early development alpha well worth paid dont think thats bad deal nowi havent completely experienced every aspect game yet including multiplayer keep mindruns great pc frames never dropped ram hybrid hddi really like visual style simple everything immediately recognizable sound awesome although wish music played bit often wonderfulcontroller support although youll need use kbm things dont think reassign buttons controllerthe gameplay loop relatively slow first cant safely engage enemies realize value talking friendly natives scattered around world quickly changesi mixed feelings region locked gear took hrs see region offer exception underwater caves coast imagine moving new region fresh start might annoying bright side theres new set enemies pets find maintains challenge remember alpha getting bit boring getting red gear vaporizing everything pathafter feeling gameplay loop dying many times course hrs havent experienced one glitch crash figuring expected character utilizing new qol features new beta character progress felt instant going rags riches fun exciting last time played opened golden door using special item expansive dungeon complete platforming obstacles variety enemies massive boss imagine completing partner would exponentially funi recommend picking game id say asking price fair one many alpha players game despite everything looking forward release years initial purchasethere many amazing things promised alpha release today sadly majority didnt make game questionable ever things people expecting developer showed twitter arent game big cities branching skill trees new classes quest tracker many smaller things didnt make dont mention keep review shortnow gamei didnt play much played enough saw enough know game going completed one full zone played othersthe game plays similar alpha version seems dumbed less skills less control build overall gameplay suffered able outbattle tougher enemies skill almost nonexistent gear everything dont find gear sheer luck hours grinding walking around map hours found first weapon got sheer luck enemies killing dying mob dropping something class simply die little improvement characterenemies dont give experience little reason fight since drops random except finish questsquests extremely repetitive zones seen pretty much randomized quests everything thingthe biggest issue version game everything find one zone locked zone means soon step borders one zone gear pieces weapons even things like glider reins use ride pets gone find againthis extremely frustrating demotivating play nothing really matters explorations actively hindered promoted game exploring questing mind player motivation explore zone finished since gear stats back way started enemies game relentless pretty much everything either shots unless adequate gear game lot potential twitter posts looking promising version cube world many others loved years ago step back hurts see went hope someone find enjoyment game way way see sadly cannot recommend enjoyable one people got alpha release continued playing beta came last week beyond excited hear game finally coming much teased content nothing positive expectations admit may hyped much upon playing beta played began clearing region started felt less less inclined continue playing region began trek new region explore similar gameplay loop alpha lucky got legendary weapon early second region made entire loop seem fairly pointless ran artifact dungeons ignored side quests within region new gameplay feels jagged reliant lucky weapon drop early within region order carry throughout rest region way rewards completing region artifacts give slight boosts transportation misc stats current loop difficult scaling practically forces player restart upon entering new region unless lucky recieve weapon grind one progression comes artifacts boost transportation upon traveling new region lose ability use quick method transportation boats gliders reigns need found within region used even current progression system shoots foot time try branch outsince initial days playing ive felt little desire return continue punishing loop without real feeling reward progressing looptldr current release cube world feels lacking gameplay loop negatively impacts enjoyment game providing real sense progressionas much wish could recommend game friends dont think could current state game would recommend keeping eye game cant recommend purchasing one people played game back like caught beauty came back still pretty cool takes like hours get time dont know youre still game play everyday doesnt bring nostalgia anymore solid game one people played alpha liked game issues heard finally getting update pretty interestedthe direction game went interesting say least still game lacks real reason play rewards get trying get best equipment region artifact really doesnt anything except give minor bonus doesnt build character even make game easierthe combat huge problem enemies dispatched easily good equipment deal rank wise really really bad luck trying find gold equipmentor diamond diamond craft stuff good luck finding even attempt artifacts youre better going new region however play mage encounter gold level mage youre dead unless somehow get hits would like add fire mages mob even r special near impossible dodge likely kill instantly im best games maybe im preachy idki dont know theres going new changes near future would like see like easier difficulty least single play knows maybe people find game easy want harder mode even id like see reason play rewarding experience maybe make levels get artifacts actually mean somethingbut yeah go game least gets work done one early alpha build players loved way things goingive forgotten long time felt rejoiced news finally coming outand im sad didnt enjoy game turned feels like game developer change heart started overi dont like unresponsive fighting feels overempowered even basic enemy feels grindy way progress game levelling system fun progressionthis fun one loved alpha game hyped full build announced incredibly disappointing see nearly everything liked cube world removed full release optimistic willing give game chance purchased game years ago part alpha purchase years ago included vision riding coat tails minecraft heyday going actual progression content quests infinite worlds explore much promises taking away alpha owners alpha owners deserve game promised yes entitlement purchased game known alpha state means would eventually released game features promises laid developersthis version cube world promised sold us somehow developer years development time worked full time game took every feature confirm twitter destroyed promising game decadethe developers dramatically changed game progression zone locking gear creates false pretense advancement player creates earns bb gear gear used kingdom leave kingdom gear earned longer valid lack content hidden false progressioni hope two developers make nms style come back games current vision says otherwiseat time wouldnt recommend game anybody optimistic happy cube world fully released wollay released unfinished extremely fun garbage suck wollay hope single person buys awful game waited six years got hopes sent crashing suck pretty damn excited cube world came back ill keep short sweetxp removedregion locked gear items like boats hang gliders reinsgame wayyy easy cheese ai borked seriously exploited water magic need winnot enough contentexploring boring regions consist types queststhe good thing say enjoyed beauty landscape graphics felt retro beautifulgranted got plenty fun even got artifacts got outright bored itlets hope future added give game engaging less mind numbing feel really fence one say early backer loved still love concept infinite world explore alpha version problems mainly lack depth game charming huge potential fast forward years get game looks plays differently unfortunately odd design decisions made detract whole experiencein essence cube world actionrpg choose one classes specializations go explore randomly generated world get quests kill bosses clear dungeons get shiny new toys sounds great right blast working way first area getting powerful equipment sole means progression similar terraria experience levelling finding equipment way increase abilities catch lose everything move new region doodads worked hard acquire simply vanish start fresh understand concept behind author trying make game seemed fresh every new area entered essence destroyed concept growth reward area artifact acquire gives permanent bonus bonuses noncombat first first artifact gave small bonus swimming speed thats worked hours acquire talk letdown honestly dont mind losing weapons armor effect going harder area rpgs suddenly even ground enemies losing movement abilities boat hang glider major kick rump want hanglide across world sail across ocean river cant soon cross region boundary toys gonea things would help move positive let us keep movement items boat hang glider make artifacts give bonuses actually matter attack defense health loot drop rate make equipment work region right equipment used regions adjacent home region truly make great game game would require complete redesign progression systemif wollay continues update game may change positive right cant recommend excited games release unfortunately failed meet expectation impossible get better gear solo ranger immersion fights gone cheese every fight uselessness getting better gear region reset reasons make game overall unenjoyable experience granted get foothold region starts speed however nullified next region overall futile experience exited game years kept pushing mind remember look wollays twitter without updatesso relase came around estatic played leveling gone skills gone skill based elements alpha severely reducedbut kept pushing finished first zone sailed boat next one boat promptly disintegrated border making worst change dawn progress made locked region reason go back anymore final nail coffin game dead would need pushed back alpha build fixed properly meaning wollays work years naughtas depressing would man go back far throwing version void putting alpha build would better choice better gameand much love style feel game always cant recomend game whos alpha far superior finished product excited game huge fan arpgs cubeworld missed mark region lock gear completely screws exploration top way actually level character gear increases bigger numbers nothing going change spells attacks etc rest time maybe skill tree gets added ill come back nope worth super excited get play many years able enjoy quite bit things need fixed regionlock something could get used please fix travelling items weird youre trying explore suddenely fall hang glider fall boat regionlock alright rest game feels kind bland six years generation regions managed get far less exciting alpha even though regions shrunk since thenthe fog war mechanic maps best thing since brought little bit wonder exploration map fully revealed change kind acceptable since one would like walk hours find single lore altar see clearly map zoom far enoughthere many balancing tweaks qol additions would love probably wont get able enjoy probably waste library bit timeim giving positive review tiny glimmer hope things get fixed enjoy even quickly become negative one nothing happenswell see goes releasesthank sticking game wollay super excited heard game finally going released october couple friends got game dismayed lack depth game everything good game stripped away really disappointing super hyped game quickly realized strange reason developer decided replace everyone loved game bunch mindless changes make game chore play cannot convince region locking items top making character progression gear based literally punishes games highlight exploring release rpg meant exploration proceed punish player exploring honestly change game back standard progression system try right good game cube world much thing followed picroma website talked cute game alpha finally came amazing frankly drought went doggedly followed every random email exchange every desperate drop information show finished product feel like shouldnt buy friends would hate weird progression system enjoyed going hardcore one little world soon needed step new zone fact zero show efforts collected relics time designing wonderful golden weapon ends nothing supposed hell multiplayer experience longer rewards working together rewards everyone going different directions cover ground reforming relics information exchange boring frankly sadly likely wollays last foray game making wonderful lasted sad went weak note prior good made people copy shit went play one ones bought alpha version spent last years feeling robbed professionalism development game playability launch another game devs great idea really good alpha version ruin upon launchthe problems saw prealpha ui buying selling items shops upgrading weapons making things zones intuitive needed reworking game looking feeling good felt like needed add flight boats reasons team people quests pvp groups poor ui remains theyve taken levelling system pretty much worth playing make review short accurateas alpha tester feel betrayed feel like made game fun taken away instead asking players wanted wollay decided change entire premise game removing lovedyes things updated added cost key features longer present game changed directionbasically short feel diabloblizzard announced diablo immortalnobody asked clearly aimed loyal pc audience moneygrab toilet gamethis cube world turned hours worth gameplay rinse repeati still hope game update gem longed waited years sadly alpha players present two sides medal one alpha version player one personal opinion without comparing alphawhen see videos alpha version game played might disappointed drastic changes game took even though creators promised things bear mind game evolve communitys voice describing game would profit different rpg aspects would like see skills indepth character progression would love see rpg elements well bad landscape beautiful quests welcomed addition would like see longlasting quests lore backstories last one region speaking regionlocked items annoying like use boat one region find new one hand exciting venture uncharted land presented new challenge rather overpowered point pointlessly search worthy opponentif see artifacts main goal game gotten main aspect adventure exploration think artifacts bonus completing region rather main goalif idea game let give honest opinion game put lot time game currently lot based luck find right gear find special items progress relatively fast one region one region key found everything completed quests region start nearly completely want go another region progress game questing system improvement gives game depth multistep quests different paths would appreciated character progression currently little nonewould buy cube world right yes would recommend buying though necessarily like games like dark souls bloodborne somewhat simelar gameplay although games much lore story games focus currently character progression exploring world world offer currently game getting sale buy otherwise might want wait updates nonetheless like game continue play start bad stuff progression random played hours struggled hard found star weapon star shoulder everything else sucked found much star things classs tho mabey itemsthen killed hard mob wild droped freaking star bow away went destroyed everything hard weapon zone exploredi picked range class remember years ago combat changed alot cant run shot anymore walk backwords sideways super slow rate firing attack getting ever traped quick sand runs hope cant hit running round round waiting quick sand finish cool said cannot attack moving run circles seconds use kick knock hp means couple hits deadthe mages world destroy range couldnt clear mage towers crystal top unlock lot barriers would given okish gear progress died seconds attacks cant seem dodge hit like trucks even star everything mage boss castle shots nothing itquests quests good talk everyone super hard tell talked would nice like little thing head could go away day something npcs everyone says thing stoped talking random groups running around said stuff look couldnt tell people loops zone twinsgearartifacts gear needs lot tweaking artifact system progression needs overhaul find artifacts around world next lore dungeons ect issue give rubbish stats im talking fight speed increase lantern swimming speed im stats mean add time happy dont feel worth playing leaving zone glider able ride pet make boosts got seem dumb last zone entered didnt get glider done maybe placejust keeping things like glider rains boat forever would change feel game completely finding another zone boost stats instead artifacts artifacts could increase movement speed attacking attach gear better stats reusable game could scale done become super op time see progression feel stronger zones feel traped right explored zone great gear one bit armor dont want move new zone without atleast weapon even feels like done wont carry well almost pointless cant see game going put practice well thinkinformation game offers nothing terms anything like regeneration thought would heal time something nope stamina want change scale map ui f keys controls menu along holding ctrl mouse wheel change zoom character didnt know could click little dots map found teleport got first night middle got dark cant actully see anything pretty pissed spent like googling hitting old twitch vids people playing see working like game timeeven wiki sucks info apart pet snack page also items like glider bell things sitting ground randomly one first things map bell couldnt find thought bugged something ran around like idiot trying find gave killing everything site googling looking got like hours later finding something else siting view bit ledge rather distant point mapnot knowing cant take stuff zones unless game dumbest thing game done sets people confusion disapointment bad reviews problem lack informationthe good stuff look feel game looks amazing runs well hardware almost years old hasnt driver update since sound amazing feel like im playing zelda snes find new spawn point play flute followed getting brighter flute playing makes feel epicthe world explored thought almost zone terms way points stuff climbed tall pillar rock found treasure gem thing guides nearby treasure started running around found chests ground use bombs get small towers hadnt spotted map running around looking treasure went boring looking parts map found sword events places look common anything mapfinding village everyone turned stone cool kill witch elsewere turn back really liked added something didnt expectthis really great game exploringgear gear system isnt perfect terms mostly luck like lacks infoyou start scrub get beat cows chickens sheep start talking npcsthey tell items map places people rescue hunt random gear get though got super unlucky starting outyour gear drops grey tier enter another zone unless end name rare items hold onto find inventory section zone swips left right access like keeps things cant really use apart new stuff gettingthere seems leveling system nothing right lvl find artifacts seem increase things like speed gliding swimming like ideathe game good play bad info mainly form infoso much freaking potential insane given track record dont see game getting updated anytime soon massive shamei wish tweaking done like letting keep boat rains zones going water zone without boat chance finding last island go realthere needs balanced early game gear progression isnt random end like things found unable complete crappy gear making sure gear low level quests class would fix pure luck issueim giving thumbs spent hours playing still want play alpha got steam key always nice hope keep working game atleast hire guy keep going add bits still say im still glad grown old alpha absolutely denying fact mehowever still say little extra effort still worth buy play yes mods suggested makes game something im sure expected come september last yearmaybe time itll become native thing thanks modding community game still worth playing maybe wait sale though wish could get refund tbh wish could give cube world good review simply cannot played alpha immersed able explore without limitations felt like progression mattered leveling progressively improving stats instead version feels incomplete like hollow shell wasbeginning new character absolute pain new points interest nice addition except respawn points guarantee within reasonable distance speaking spawning spawn could location enemies higher tier meaning progression impossible cannot measure determination hundredsthe recommendation give alpha version game minute bugs stability issues soul release version cube world lacks soul drastically changing systems people absolutely enjoyed community remained strong hyped six whole years enjoy game everything slowly becomes tedious eventually love game fade wish could like really wollay definitely step right direction artifact system introducing unique way progression however destroys progression entirely newly added region locking making legendary items go back common game introduces absolutely nothing new first region really game worth playing hours definitely indefinite game expecting wish could refund game wish could say liked absolute crap wish could say fun enjoyable experience even couple mods doesnt even come close game used spend hours playing im sorry ive put much effort trying enjoy game im willing spent money long time ago felt like waste least try enjoy enjoyed world combat movement progression eh hope comes back around good luck cant recommend game anyone current state would im sure folks enjoy even power wish would expand old one worthless wish modding would hopefully get wanted instead something wasnt really even worth buying hopefully get fixed update wish game worked would let game wish option yes maybe like game dont miss meaningful progression alphain version game progress two ways neither value first way gear lacks value bc soon leave region found gear becomes unusablethe second way artifacts items find give minor bonuses moderately important stats boat speed need find new boat every time enter new areait honestly feels like starting ever couple hoursalso fair warning dev history vanishing think hello games mans sky released times long looks like might thanks people liking game wish game good really isnt progression essentially nonexistent theres little bit within regions whole youre either extremely powerful extremely weak spirit cubes pretty solid form progression alpha actually removed modern versions discernible reason world generation pretty good fun explore region locking traversal items greatly discourages wait lot updates things devs said would game launch actually present might better wish game wouldnt freak play multiplayer speed play someone else mps game still laggy idk cause internet makes want play game anymore wish time alpha build explained process behind changes made drastici personally feel like alpha issues progression see perspective wanting change entirely scrap iti love concept artifacts almost useless tiny gameplay difference weapons armor useful one region feels heartbreaking time genuinely great items probably getting near finished region first place going want head another one going another region items useless gone one confusing decisions video game could possibly makei think truly want try game first time good time try one really knows game go feel like hear news eventually really dont understand cube world genuinely hope game improve style movement music wonderful lot new things relating musical instruments artifacts could totally used actual progression system right game absolutely progression feels kinda pointless wont recommend change following things save time money thingsokaymy real letdown reason dont recommend game items region locked means nearly every item get useless change ingame biome doesnt rare rare like got nice weapon region moment step region item lose tons dmg cant kill mobs need get items region etci dont get choose kind bs within procedural generated map infinite biomesalso biomesregions bigthanks reading wont write much review address fact gamers today way spoiled feel need shut games everything isnt served silver platter cube world provided hours entertainment ever since new update getting updates past onei would hate game dev today continue support care game community wonder still remember random foods feed petsdid cat like ice cream wafflei dont remember would say mixed reviews deceiving played alpha im sure jarring starting beta hour give game cannot played like alpha different game looks identical different well game lore regions artifacts wont get details would recommend guide get started tldr artifacts level explore new regions loot locked region making every new region fresh start kinda would recommend game yes easy pick learn depth seems alot fun friends biggest concern developers game done cooking input community shape future cube world hope development continue least yearsedit cannot recommend game developers given dont respond sort contact update game save money would like see different ways travel think sleigh winter biome pulled dog pets also weathercycle would nice always sun shine clouds imagine rain snow lot work different procentage clouds duable guess wind buffs nerfs speed glider would cool feature well would like see pet inon depending wheter bird stick sail boat hard understand different storylines would like suggest books collect information gather would love able recommend game however another case lost potentialif interested learning potentially one biggest letdowns indi setting however recommend looking history game bit honest tragedy would love recommend game everybody far cry originally years ago polished without doubt everything loved game longer fun level locking regions far biggest downside nothing region locked raiding dungeons friends best part way back takes good get decent gear able actually able fight enemies regions changed would happily play game loved friends would love recommend game cant zone system change area entire gear usless huge grind grind sorry want old system back would love say could recommend game cant current price point im hours almost finished first zone realization im going lose everything upon entering new zone makes work progress feel pointless way ensure level progression stockpile resources even seems theres limit amount resource holddont get wrong game fun adventure aspect great ive enjoyed play time dont see point continuing first zone cleared dont think worth usd maybe get something would recommend game current state six years development lot features promised shown scraped final release progression system reworked completely really uniquie interesting approach yet far inferior compared progression system alpha release least current form stats ever improve microscopic valuesyour gear regionlocked personally dont consider much issue might youin alpha version used play randomlygenerated world still generated release version everyone plays seed nowi still hopeful receive updates even though currently looks like developer disappeared would recommend current state diverged far core idea longer game advertised prime example echochamber betatesters community unable help development something could nominated game year likesso sad se potential go waste would prefer mixture progression system alpha rest betain current state game offers real motivation play longer hoursplease wollay dont offended shook third players like cube worldif want change improve game asap otherwise another six years one willing play current state cant recommendcube world anyone offers maybe hours fun playing time isnt worth would probobley recomend sale since game kinda broken premise current foarm still reasonabley fun first hours feel phisicaly stronger altough still tend better time dont rely hang glider pet riding boats begin would recommend game nostalgia wouldnt recommend hate grindy tedious games would recommend game price quite nice however sucks find new gear new region gains finishing region small bigger goal work would give reason finish regions however lot fun finishing one region friends got hours gametime would recommend game side note wait sale worth price tag right would say overall hype really game overall really good game issue getting started game resources rare find likely arent gonna get good gear even average gear start playing tough get past first obstacles people giving choices places feels pressured go things arent powerful enough game early game feel little tough really get would write review honesty believe current state game change would likely make poor rendition post reason recommend however probably harder time accepting fact regional key items regional item progression item progression definentely interesting concept however looking longevity team play makes seem extremely tedious waste time anything like post removal skill trees nice however believe given class skills except one base skill poor decision sortve dehumanizes character making seem like copy paste repeat insertgenericheronamehere love cube world loved complicated knows long till changed even ever however anyone hasnt played beta apart alpha id definentely say give shot im favor changes may anyone hesitant buying game id recommend waiting changes think bit longeredit gave game time plan give still fun truly seems far easy really difficult beggining keeps interesting especially party members however people start getting equipment becomes cake walk ended clearing artifact dungeon bit hour getting new region whereas took us hours clear first region truly cant see much reason exploration play game however key item removal upon entering new region hinders exploration isnt much reason also removed pvp sucks oh well wouldnt play want indepth action combat game thats sort going set disappointment recommend playing want endless exploration game sink good number hours relaxing boyfriend lot fun world beautiful absolutely full variety talk npcs youll find sorts places map go among friends shared screenshots variety experiences impressive artifact mechanic turns leveling objectivebased loot hunt requires seeking lore uncover new gameplay mechanicswhich im finding quite funfor combat think main issue stats scale within regions found almost encounters either underleveled died quickly overleveled nothing could stand ustldr good worldgen good want game exploration keeps fresh rewarding long time wouldnt recommend game currently especially played original cube world current state nothing like original game full bugs strange progression system unfulfilling want full review please feel free watch analysis write review heavy heart really really looking forward back alpha great hoping improvement alpha many years got region locked adventure tedium long grinding real benefit got slow start redo every time go new region get minor buffs come theyre literally useless multiplayer also horrendously plagued latency issues literally unplayable many people writing similar reviews need convincing take dont buy game buy itsince already back first came got steam key free reopen wound thought healed little dramatic whatever im holding hope maybe developer come wood work address issues calls features highly doubt itsuch disappointment wrote fairly long impressionreview beta blogurl unfortunately long steam allow ill quick tldr bthe gistbcube world vibrant charming fun game enjoyable flow im sure long term replayability way progression works gear artifacts condition continue exploring upping skills dont know thats really enough maintain interest game gear resetting per regions barring plus gear feels like negative punishment means feel punished something taken away suspect increase reward would balance outin alpha problem good gear acquired takes matter hours everything became trivial motivation significantly reduced fact got bored alpha quite fast beta attempts alleviate dont know right route admire new take mechanics though always respect developer trying something new props giving goregardless think price point still thumbs bcautionb im sure long itll retain interest individual said imassive recommendation younger audiencesi friendly game kids lights imagination adventures vibrant colours id say also good casual play friendsnice see finally id give neutral review could cant ill say sway toward nocompletely forgetting development communication woes lets see game isthe game thrusts great initial state huge sprawling land explore townspeople talk quests undertake spend good hours slowly grinding gear overcoming great challenges eventually get artifacts area special zones complete move onto next zone wham gone start scratch thing keep artifacts got things give movement speed bonuses equipment lost going different area superfluous level counter going one getat point pretty hard keep going feels much rewarding start new character class rush different zone thereso good game well heck yeah combat great world immerses pretty well problem feels pointless dont get stronger completing zones get faster boats gliders light things bit levels artifacts give actually increased base stats even small amount itd feel little worth nawso get tough call see game bursts hour adventures repeat indefinitely sounds appealing sure go youre looking meaningful rpg progression isnt place id like address backlash game receiving thus far agree reviews say region locking equipment well items hang glider boat cumbersome find availability plus items help continue exploration regions adequatei dont like artifact leveling system currently tweaks like giving actual effect climbing speed etc could great way incentivize exploringfurthermore crafting new items limited regions instead getting crafting books gave couple recipes could used region would incentivize exploring main draw gameoverall experience playing game thus far fun despite many flaws game hope wollay continue work problems fixed get game couldve id like recommend game support windows made work id rather working game initial install rather patchworked game id love take time explain think game needs serious reworkbut like wooley ill remain silent make things unfunremove ya ill change positive game gets better futurethis game current state worth purchase incredibly shallow horrible progression start incredibly weak randomly fight legendary gear immediately overpowered basically punished exploring enter different regions map unless rare gear stuff turns trash real progression artifacts grant things like hang glider speed incredibly small many hours could spent get top movement gear gone go new regions leads incredibly slow walking across mostly empty map die depending traveled map might end walking ridiculous amount get back experience one region youve experienced game offer new regions different skins basically also removed normal leveling system leveling skills overall think huge let majority people played original alpha worth wait hope developer takes feedback moves turn great game potential unfortunately though developer far communicating community one knows game future major issues addressed wont putting time game ill leave since believe development continues issues resolved soonits fun game spend hours time two regions fun toward end second one realised gonna basically first area since biome surrounding weapons fun wish variation like elemental wands instead fire water mage able get firey sword warrior new level system novel serves better bragging rights thing improvements would nice us skill tree put skills increase hp mp stamina different vehicles similar alphanew pets fun mixed enough would cool could put lot effort tame super rare animalsbasically nice see development wish hope get development soon since love concept style game ill start saying game definitely fun first zone two essentially content rest game imho worth price pointthe first issue game starting fresh character way difficult absolutely everything demolishes arent lucky enough find quest early going walking around map talking npcs hours anything meaningful theres also alternative cheese high level enemy dragging life shrine hopefully get yellow weapon class proceed face roll rest contentthe second issue concerns region locking gear exploration items disappear second step foot new zone honestly think system potential right stepping new region effect creating new character carry gold crafting materials think could use get head start region buying crafting new gear locked behind quests complete progressing scratchthe third final issue game thing think could massively change improve state game right artifact system upon launching game quickly realize gain experience confusing played alpha experience main point progression game beta experience replaced artifact system essentially progress zone explore collect gear lore order complete dungeons reward artifact end troubles artifacts might ask well give bonuses exploration items hang glider boat making able move across world faster well level per artifact nifty right decide go sailing big ocean biome youve eyeing boat poof disappear completely practically makes permanent progression system absolutely uselessif wasnt bad enough developer always developing game game passion product hobby refused offer work mojang could work game problem known severe lack communication skills highly doubt listen critiques suggestions people game far development considering hasnt past years simply cannot agree slapping price tag game without intent improve development game money received feedback given im hours say still much enjoy game actually becomes fun time spend playing itits true things drastically changed since alpha also played im personally bothered changes hard part game first steps zero gear nowhere go get lucky get decent equipment mark checkpoints complete first missions theres stopping im currently stars two regions working way third artifacts region clear get equipment carries next ones names could honestly happier im fan cube world however game current state lacking content alpha things wollay posted twitter id like say faith wollay keep developing game adding features shown years ago dont think happen considering seen talk community feedback id like proven wrong though im huge fan alpha version game many many hours game probably least beta still enjoyable lot reasons alpha glaring issues sense making progress game kind gone weapons key items tied specific land basically start dare explore game required exploration see offer huge turn artifacts dont give enough boost considered best items game said still fun time im huge fan changes im willing play every update comes supposing wollay willing make changes betterment game instead ignoring good criticisms would say buy game sale current state wouldnt pay full price mentioned got beta free alpha buyer years ago didnt pay product steam paid years ago none less like open world games character customization grinds game still good one one kind really aware painful flaws break game point making wonder worth working butt get anywhere game start every time exploreedit well wollay huge disappointment game dead real dont buy game go steal like everyone else earlier version better game im alpha player promised different game got currently ill reviewing game alpha old promises didnt existthe good think exploration first region feels really exciting engaging questing feels amazing first hours getting new pets really fun new pets feel really good finding random treasures around map really good combat ok currently needs balancing character feels like doesnt much ways engage combat either ultimatesthe bad game gets repetitive real quick around hours game start realize every biome quest feels pretty much quest always always fight mobs followed boss save gnomes save random person grave yard getting crafting books currently useless region lockyou loose special items everytime cross new region questing mechanics repetitive theyre always nothing special quest progression artifacts used level level exploration stats give microscopic stats something like glider speed loose entering new regionthings improve progression region lock needs rework new quest mechanics need implemented make quest specific biomes artifacts need boost stats exploration stats mobility items glider boat reins region locked found first region kept universal item im alpha player im part picky side fan base im glad play support great game im alpha player review wont count towards score think game worth money least ill happily change mind idiotic systems place get overhaul year old unsupported alpha fun full release game tried hard perfect wollays quest perfect game created game identity crisis makes wish playing game even makes wish playing year old alpha instead full release open world rpg punishes exploring restricts taking equipment gear whenever cross new region absolutely zero progression considering everything gets reset hour two feels pointless thing could think playing good couldve games everything better unless change cant even force play im changing review positive think bit harsh game first got huge difficulty wall first starting actually started fun really managed get hang things obvious flaws comes replayability region locking paper doesnt seem bad practice hard balance think tweaks region locking artifacts game lot better shape game massive potential hope updates dev add new interesting content keep replayability shouldnt shoulders modding community improve game im disappointedthe alpha version simple wellbalanced mechanics perfect base greatest rpg ever needed content like interesting quest system complicated skill tree options character customization redo everything scratch bit undone masterpiece hands throw away make entirely new mechanics dont work outregion locked items gear new skill system precisely absense skills availible beginning pointless leveling system based collecting useless artifacts killed progression interesting exploring world sensless hope youll abandon dubious decisions return supposed waiting long get mediocre game obscure gameplay counting wollay im dogpiling large group people claiming game worth years wait worth bucks stay away developers basically went hiding years got feeling bit hurt last time itll another years another update since feeling super hurt im enjoying game far one major thing would change different pieces gear special item get shouldnt locked certain region get boat want able use boat everywhere forest want special armor work everywhere desert im enjoying game far think need work like useful artifacts villagers actually giving missions great start like region progression keeps going around destroying things seconds moving gives difficulty starting bit difficult rewards items throughout region making easier progress land really like alpha still promising alpha hopefully get see wollay pixxie update polish game full time job im enjoying greatly im extremely excited see game look like couple updates already super fun shows much promise would love able connect play public server people im glad waited years leveling skill removed really nice im glad finally able play game many years fun friends cant recommend current statethe gameplay fun worry going get repetitive quickly youre essentially quests forced basically start scratch whenever leave area theres artifacts dont really feel rewarding give tiny boost one stats relating either traveling speed light radius lanternthe game also confusing unique approach taking lack tutorial sort explanation things work rather frustrating unless youve heard people chances wouldnt know need collect artifacts level use middle mouse button place marker map another ability linked middle mouse button youre standing still gear region locked half stuff even matterthis game lot potential combat fun got lot issues need addressed really wish kind end goal something make feel motivated keep playing losing progress quests get tiny boost lanterns light radius doesnt feel worth itthis game lot potential pretty fun finally able play cant recommend current state im going attempt delve realm counterargument lets start things im fan ui lack conveyance user interface extremely cluttered hides imperative information tutorial element whatsoeverjumps progression point certain area go small scared god minutes get good weapon isnt much inbetween time experiencespecific area affinity system gear useful area got annoying see reason considering progression rapidnow

basedartifacts substantialall miles wide inches deep true dissapointment im gonna real honest guysits like playing cube world new style bit new content like hrs theres gonna anything left dont think wolay one creator game anything new wanted release get money get sadly us fans get anything actually scammaz wouldnt recommend buying really worth hour content thing im gonna get right point review dont like grindy games hard learning curve game ive started playing alpha came really upset stopped working game entirely brought back obviously excited especially steam less yet one biggest problems hard get feet arguably made worse release get feet one biome restart completely scratch next arbitrary almost unnoticeable changes claiming artifacts formeri love game death unique art style world building theyve put problem eventually get going gets really fun randomly generated secrets things accessed certain items find biome awesome concept love personally nothing beats relief satisfaction feel killing particularly hard enemy cube world overall cube world lovely charming game updates quality life gameplay devs could really amazing masterpiece hands im gonna keep real cannot recommend game state us love sense progression exploration feeling like theyre getting stronger without getting time wasted kinda got screwed loved alpha know wasnt perfect damn better beta fully released game gonna lie loved added music new species vast open colorful lands really wanted make game look feel sounds wonderful falls shorti respect wollay trying something different aint cup tea im happy see game finally released though perfect think great potential room future improvement ive put lot hours even played online point found enjoyable maybe everyone yeah getting mixed reviews enjoy simple things one might overhyped well worth buy im fun im fun yes im fun perfect enjoyable worth think wollay okay job im fun things tweaked better overall ive gotten moneys worth got alpha im much fun game id recommend game people love adventure exploration theres plenty also invite friends well makes game slightly easiercompared alpha lot changed changes strange like adapting new system gear levels items losing power next zone takes bit get used tothere one major issue might come mans sky issue game gets repetitive youve seen locations hope wolfram keeps amazing work im honestly good time matters im honestly really liking game lol mean would nice region locking softened artifacts useful skills explained still think better original im love game right hours ive gotten around starter biome im playing game brother enjoying game lot recommend anyone likes adventure games im gonna say everyone saying better im happy game updated may problems clearly everyone likes path went long see updates future always potential improvement even still like game im liking alpha issue end game progression feeling stale creator solved unusual way like trying something different im loving first reaction region based gear negative spending time playing love makes going new zone exciting makes finding gear really exciting best take exploration seen years dont ever play open world game wish could feeling started well cube world get experience regularly definitely need watch video explaining mechanics etc game doesnt hold hand dont get dismayed get instantly killed soon spawn look colours mobs youre fighting one games could definitely keep coming back always find something new challengingif like open world rpgs youre sick old levelling gear grind cube world fresh take systems youve waiting im loving time game conquering land land im mixed game played came steam remember loving sure enjoy complete area get awesome stuff move next start scratch aspect friend starting would probably less tedious annoying im great review writer easily say minutes playing would rather go back playing alpha build purchased long ago game upgrades make look flashy gameplay quickly made clear game ive playing waiting update forim hoping similar lifespan mans sky least launch bad gets updated something im ready willing sink hours hopefully friends im going expand upon review much points want make already touched peoplei open minded new systems first hoped would succeed wollay wanted doesnt work used infinite scaling back alpha good gameplay mechanic wollay tried switch away new system easiest described infinite scaling without scaling honestly made worsethis much potential tried wollay patiently withstood test time shame cube world im going mention alpha order keep review centralized around core mechanics utility gear gets reset entering new region normal gear gets reset entering new region gear gets reset entering region adjacent region progression mentioned gear mostly region locked meaningful level system sure get levels getting artifact dungeon get artifacts artifacts affect movement speed bonuses climbingdivingswimmingsailinghangglidingridingetc move region region completing one getting reset getting couple artifacts artifacts already received lose value move enough regions away got artifacts also dimishing returns dependant amount artifacts progression movement speed bonuses diminishing returns get enough customizability choose subclasses class difference subclasses usually skills apart cant really customize fight skill tree system adapt fighting playstyle weapon armor customization shell cause region locking cant keep weapon regions would want customize way look going change couple regions im gonna rehash already said game current state review late enough release anything could say subject said say im still fun nothing else good timewaster ive gotten least much enjoyment price number equally greater priced titles allinall personally recommend game im happy cubeworld became alpha use character progression nice land generation spirit cube deep water full fish nice random generated dungeon village total freedom exporation seed based world bugnow weird river shape character progression punitive border everyone map ok lets honest true got nice qol quest lore costim sorry wollay use love game like lot people felt love alpha got years teasing new content twitter shameful cant recommend game im really fan region locking least much wider area region level scaling would better imo otherwise game isnt shabby alpha really best im sure wollay able take game many great elements ton potential turn infinite exploration basic skill tree endless character progression theres character progression exploration reason play beating starting zone everything teased years following alphas launch either removed never added seems like stringing everyone along fact half features already present alpha removed anyone following alpha along never able play dont buy game people never heard cubeworld stumbled across dont buy game either potential hours repetitive gameplay youll able squeeze never worth price tagalso cant expect cubeworlds failures change wollay apparently disappeared hes deleted blog tweets likely gone good good riddance im really enjoying game really happy see much game changed new things see explore exploration fun satisfying combat still fun two classes within class different attacks using different weapons dungeons still blast explore beati wish incentive keep getting artifactslevels continuing play gameplay loop fun going zone gear explore hope progression overall matches progression exists zone individually said love way progression feels zone satisfaction gear upgrade finding

definite thenupdate theres actually mod allows gear transferred regions also hang glider boat reins makes game thought going lot fun youre gonna buy id suggest trying im saying someone never played cube world alpha thoroughly enjoying playing game solo friends im new im good game beautiful people seem complaining alpha makes reviews huge bias would agree region lock bit extreme completely removed toned would also love leveling skill trees added extremely fun rpgs exploration would fun motive get specific items areas available area items region locked imo neither hang glider simple items like love game exciting first experience youre debating buying game youve never played alpha would go ahead get played alpha make choice honestly im fun far ive played hours day bought game im disappointed waited waited waited get instead taking great alpha creating complete deep world experience get gameplay loop designed discourage time investment robs player satisfaction killing monsters looting better gear questingnot thank goodness alpha build still works im excited see wollay added cube world steam definitely help game grow prosper wife manage bring updates cant hate team two people taking forever make great game takes alot work effort im glad see wollay still wants grow game dream started great game matter long takes since alpha ill till dream reality enjoy way im glad game finally massive changes original alpha release final product im sorry one likes game mrcube update point right please fuicking waste money steamcomoverwatchplatinum boosting im sorry partypooper alpha player feel like current verion game huge step backwardsi fond memories playing back eagerly waiting new patches never came nowthen saw coming steam omg hyped obviously sat made character decided stream game show viewers ive talking excitedly past week beforehand sadly hour session filled nothing frustration disappointment sadnessi missed level skills system could barely anything anything didnt good time alli pet said mountable yet couldnt figure actually mount sure bug needed something clearly wasnt explained ingamei simply felt lack progression purpose play game anymorei sat alpha kinda weird time sad alpha much enjoyable beta versioni wish basics feel game kept game today bought game years ago feel kinda betrayed know mean im sorry give game bad review really loved alpha hours sunken game beta changes dont seem work removal xp system exchange artifact system gives benefits playing removed whole progress game grinding levels equip leave zone current equipment gets rendered basically worse basic item thought hangliding nice well leave current area lose things like start start addition pretty neat skill tree got removed progression regard either gets changed sort progression preferably old system maybe mixture satisfaction getting good gear would really recommend state cant im sorry im sorry mean love game really big update worth wait soon feel done one area need restart whole process im still going recommend game best game rather still fun play solo friends games style alone enjoyable random generated world actually good choice level bit questionable best something like equipment level idea covers also enjoy area equipment work toward set universal gear keeps level travel areas would like see content mobs destinations real flesh regions also think changes level could really polish character side things add little npcs world feels alive would make game near perfect im sure everyone heard issues shortcomings took years move alpha beta became lot less fun imo simply cannot recommend game current form misses mark long shot needs major redesigns remotely fun dont count though given devs track recordone word really sums disappointing im sure youve read plenty reviews game isnt good im tell completely true cant upgrade abilities like really nothing work towards point hoarding weapons cross border spawn lose amazing stats loved game cant recommend game current state im writing review alpha brought friends lot joy bit play beta want support game however giving good review though intention ignoring games faults decide buy game know quirks isnt perfect said lot provide somebody enjoys exploring collecting crafting small amounts grinding class based combat game still going stylei recommend playing friends though enjoy playing solo almost muchalright ill start saying absolutely see lot things people taking issue reviews however lot things changes made alpha build lot us played back people really enjoyed version game included major game changes artifacts zoning jarring due changes spend first hours kind lost totally enjoying however get hang class semiefficient character building fell right back enjoyment satisfaction played alphaaside major game changes also quality life features added game already make worth playing least kind interested alpha things like fast travel flying new key items exciting fun play around definitely consider improvements hoped quality life features would extend past game play like perhaps something could considered tutorialadjacent least controls listed menu like functions keys game zoning classes artifacts town vendors crafting really isnt explained clearly also things like old cube world creator probably changed game released dipped money look past still good game nothing like og still good game ive admired game time youtube videos like finally gotten chance buy try youve enjoyed paul soares juniors adventures youll likely fall love exploration options great im still learning hands time im enjoying moments come ive around game since alpha never alpha copy watched gameplay super stocked game completely different worse though hours one character far basically maxed two areas far think current system might go character might try character types like many people said artifacts pointless hell saying youre level artifact could mean less loot feels awesome though said youre absolutely trash beginning game stars combat defense youre way powerful play mage probably strongest class soon get yellow weapon gg take negative criticism grain salt game gem gem cleaned cut problems could easily fixed beautiful world awesome monsters balanced exciting class system updates could role fixing balancing progression maybe story youre someone willing put hope company dont buy game dont see game left like even opened modding someone would clean ive enjoying journey spend first biome still working atm sort emptiness killing mobs without xp miss leveling pets leftovers drops really fun way yellow lose bit joy knowing red items likely present yellow highest biomes seem rich deverse punch gut leave items longer useful boot boat pet riding dis heartening many new features add alot depth compared alpha questing joy though rng element doesnt always deliver handmade aspects dungeons certainly shine spicing rng worlds addition treasure rooms way open creative enjoyable share game extremely fun crawl freind though alpha fun xp solo cant say would enjoy iteration much alone also different mobs npcs really cool hope anything suppose really hoping rather using npcs meatshields would quests involved teaming like player people dont play multiplayer incentive want play others enjoyed alpha ive fun far problems seems everything biome hand enjoy idea finding creative solutions full great ideas even arent perfect also graveyard saw monstrosities night glowing eyes hulking baddies looked really cool nightshurikens damage maybe highwater mages still strongalso still level hours xdso hours working together brother last hour gained two levels found artifacts first biome moving say though artifacts effects got enjoyable idea carrying things didnt appealing also went new biome got pick whatever gear liked look adventure first degrades armor gear wasnt bad punch gut reins cant live without items dwill continue update play ive enjoying buddy week still like current region lock understand many complains system feeling unfulfilling feels like im going new adventure every new zone go ive looking forward release cube world since word first came played alpha enjoyed definitely fair share problems dev went silent number years twitter updates would start showing year little frequentlyin current state sadly cant recommend game sense progression gear region locked except piece gear randomly rolls allows used regions outside region found utility unlocks sailboat hang glider reins allow ride pet lost crossing regions includes removing boat cross one ocean biome another havent plummeting sky hang glide regional borderthe persistance game minor character boosts gotten finding artifacts world give incredibly minor buffs things like move speed lamp radius etc minimal mean lamp upgrades giving light radius instead radiusi game could great balance changes certain things stands right cant recommend given past state updates communication people initially purchased dont high hopes game receive sort consistant updates currently game still feels like early access title ive playing since alpha yea sure gone changes since questionable still fun friends understand region locking way like rpgs within rpg get friends op current region start new one friends challenge passion project normally would consider customer company considering like ticket experience mans work art might exactly enjoy know statement resonate see side im saying feel ive playing since alpha beta could fun theory even different teasedpromised falls short every mark years development seemingly moved sideways forwards doesnt bode well future game alli wish could recommend thisedit game abandoned surprise surprise ive playing alpha quite written popular tools back regarding server management cube world set proceduraly generated world everything voxel based free explore however game feels repetitive short cant really enjoy multiplayer people since anti cheating measures everything stored localy default control scheme abysmal okayish game hours falls short providing meaningful long time enjoyment ive waiting years sadly seems improvements base level things integral coop rpg present shared multiplayer friendly player summoning sadly current state must tell looking play friends avoid time another year nap ive waiting game last years enjoyed back day soo much fun moment started didnt feel connection witht game lot things enjoyed back day removed world empty back day took hours run around trying get materials get better gear still havent gotten really loved game hoping fall im really dissapointed know might get hate playing hours leaving review cant play need refund hours got alsmot nothing well work real life dont need work free time id like enjoy moment game little bit challange next challange game offers also offers big open world small ammounts everything memories ive waiting game longit wasnt worth wait ive waiting game since waited six years traditional rpg depth skill trees infinite level progression infinite worlds via map seeds originally promised picroma websitethis game absolutely none cannot tell disappointed learn progression ever permanently stays iteration cube world menial stats actually anything make stronger cube world alpha least interesting game loop release destroyed fun game loop made borderline stupid choice depower player daring explore exploration based rpg nothing game matters beyond initial region steamroll anyway get single lucky drop cannot recommend game core gameplay changes heavily current state absolutely replay value beyond initial hours first region even feel great play ive waiting years game come finally changed lot original alpha mostly positive ways quests much better theres much variety interesting things game things dont like much enemies giving xp drop money good drops enough still worth kill another thing im sold region locked items definitely keeps game stagnating think intended tweaks feel like region locking could lot better ive waiting long game played nearly hours beta remarks definitely like challenge beginning basically start nothing hard hell get anywhere items equipment think totally worth region locking system way brutal taste spend much time grinding stuff go explore new region youre basically left started havent played enough see much artifacts stack change difficulty level entering new region im excited see grind takes still good game youre sort thing imo would happy could keep reigns boat glider etc entering new region ive waiting years years play game admittedly saw new alpha version finally come backlash received little scared play didnt want play game dreaming hyping ages actually turns badbut actually think whole exploration factor added fun used sure run around lot gather boat glider whatnot along get good enough gear order actually permanently level stats artifact isnt leveling isnt everything skills strategies good running life things turn south think thats really entertaining ive waiting years game come finally good old releases unfortunately ill give go time goes update review accordinglyfor ill recommend caveat isnt really game previously ive game ever since even loving game major problems devs refuse oppenly communicate community game development ever since people got play doesnt feel like polished product new version major problems well game lacks progression play infinite game cycle hours repeat everything devs tend dissapear took money people almost didnt update people plans future january almost remade game scratch game even genre anymore action adventure game simply play exploration game sake exploration cant recommend people stick game even tho feel could unique fun line man sky ive followed cube world since excited hear release coming steam played alphacube world offers similar experience legend zelda run around slaying monsters acquiring gear items drop gather money healingcrafting items wilderness whacking weapon offers similar minecraft experience moment making character released world without much direction case recommend looking guide someone made community page world wonderful bright vibrant colors daynight cycle gorgeous rotation slow enough doesnt ruin fun reach nighttime takes roughly hour voxel style using small cubes instead large bricks like minecraft appealing exploration great one zone ive explored typical plains pockets forests fun adventure gameplay engaging really enjoy combat figured rotation abilities keybinds similar overwatch working bound mouse buttons others around w key changeable like creatures great ive fair share absolutely vaporized squirrel capable ninja dodging punching disturbing hive hornets proceeded mob punch fists wandering near cult meeting graveyard approaching thought friendly ogre nighttime using lantern classes really nice ive started warrior specialized guardian shieldsword combo gameplay play classes specializations different playstylesthe controversy surrounding game based item progression throwing traditional xp bar experienced games alpha stated earlier ive played lot rpg games need level wow one whopping levels could skip level progression instantly make characters enjoy current content would agree gearbased progression cube world brings better allows start playing game sure issues small nitpicks see easily updated fixed overall play friends sport legendary grade armor gets brought level join go new zone gather artifacts lose upon entering new zone things like climbing spikes remove stamina bar requirement climbing reins ride pet etc armor weapons stats added onto zone acquired simply lose stats entering new zone entirely lose armor weapons like initially thought negative reviews nice way letting play indefinitely adventure definitely better friendsi highly recommend game people like terraria starbound legend zelda diablo minecraft would highly recommend playing friends ive got say im trying best really give game benefit doubt seeing development team lovely couple grew game wanted much developers went hiatus game great idea original alpha phenominal right currently cannot recommend beta simply made alpha amazing unique simply cut betathe removal rpg leveling exp removal blind yet rewarding exploration randomized worlds couldve createdin return sortve mix enjoyable work ethic grindy alpha looteresc leveling system extremely much time consuming inconsistentheres hoping instead dismissing review nostalgia trip release cubeworld realized originally perfected rpg rewards player exploration means steadily improving instead time consuming rng ive lot fun game knowing gigantic game potential im excited playing year hiatus pros limitless adventure literallysimple progression nothing difficultsecrets lots foundcons progression seems artificially plantedcurrently nothing levels earncrafting seems almost pointless almost helpful youve started new region time everything need actually make gear matters except first need quest gives recipe items usually difficult one youd need gear complete anyways almost pointlessoverall lot fun game hoping see wollay game like maybe new classes skill trees etc ive really good time game get changes alpha version take game tons funseparate progression biomes means explore without compromising progress friends coop mode version also eliminates need grinding goal get better equipment randomly obtained quests bosses tackle harder ones battles quests varied fun challenging tons mobs discover lots pets find collect seriously understand fans expecting refined version alpha disappointed reason ignore cube world ive game since alpha wish wollay stuck original ideas updated already place instead stripping best elements continue play alpha hope one day itll get updates deserves ive put thousands hours continue im sorry wollay pixie cannot recommend current implementation matter much hurts ive game early access steam long time great fun play friends explore game changed ive game since first sold taken market game quirky fun first thought would updates case anything game fewer features alpha leveling system tutorial sorts skill trees anymore etc support game nothing money grab made developer rewarded ive invested quite lot time game past days highly recommend game unless issues time management gaming like doi spent hours exploring first zone enjoying every moment regionlocking system could probably use iteration really bad unless youre rushing zone zone anyhow want big bite adventurethats digestible friends easily join onthan cube world game ive invested several hours game completed two regions gotta say dungeons favorite part game overall incredible like zelda game region combat simplistic skill based especially given absence longterm progression continue play happy bought game especially fun friends multiplayer feels much better alpha problem hackersmodders kinda ruin fun kick game current system gear work regions unless find gear good adjacent regions gear thats good several regions levels increase base stats reflecting number artifacts artifact gives stats swimming speed climbing speed future addition combat stats go artifacts adding special abilities artifacts adding rare equipment added affected region lock would good quality life changes gameplay loop hope wollay pixxie continue work game bring refinement current system course programmer understand thats huge undertaking two developers choose continue development bring quality life updates would certainly pay microtransactions cosmetic items nothing pay win pay dlc simply donate money either looking forward many hours cube world definitely recommend game even controversy around new system thanks filling gap childhood beautiful game ive looked forward game long time disappointed turned game great concept vibrant world right cant recommend game really hope developers arent put launch continue work game community feedback mind game great though game doesnt justify price tag youre looking play wait sale wait hopefully improve day comes game good better hoped gladly buy cant justify refunding time ive never much disappointed short period timeill begin positives thingsthe concept really great gameplay responsive game style wonderful graphicsits honestly really appealing dream lots things could happen playing gamelets forget updates developer posted twitter game could seen fair reviewthe progression system huge pile concept could great appealing farm hours swim speedexploration yaaaay boat lets explore ocea boat disappeared farm boat hang glider everytime enter new region interesting exploration conceptwell least like developers communicate well community youve come riiiight place fact wollay never says anything problems pointed community maybe one day hopeso yeah dreaming great possibilities game offer fact transformed nightmares really hope something done game improve actually alpha years ago way much better ive owned game since alpha played years sunk hundreds hours alphathe alpha wasnt perfect fun lot little annoying things funwith hours beta say game still fun sure lot changed better somethings need fixed tweaked alpha build new item system focus equipment good basis needs tweaking exploration focus fantastic region locking needs reworked going new region still really fun finding plus gear feels new musicmonstersquests new dungeons amazing new respawn system great welli hope game keeps getting updated matter many gripes hear fun worth money fantastic base needs polishing ive owned game since first released like decades ago promise youtubers servers life taken sale dev vanished years later started posting updatesthis went sorta okay really bad never lasting potential years could changed somehow made worse expect make game awesome truly think would end like thisi waited years holding onto hope let many things could done went ignored poor features ive paid game six years ago didnt even get lousy tshirt freaking jokethe final game features far far less content thant alpha got rid skill tree crying loud alpha rough edges miles ahead final productive paid alpha access years ago truly excited final version arrive say im mad im disappointed would lie mad confused disappointed publish giant worldgiven beautiful without ability develop charakter important parts inventory purposely reset leave biom boarders kills longtime motivation instantly especially compared way alpha playedif youre contemplating purchase run fast run far bucks bucks much clear regression alpha version gamethe flying anymation scalable map cute though ive played alpha lot liked despite lack content new release opinion garbage new version cube world could really nice game content shuffled much lot things removed instead mechanics etc used wollay added lot non player friendly garbagei recommend buying game recommend wait ant see wollay going fix game hide another years ive played alpha betaalthough alpha beta lack content well fleshed rpg aspects wollays beta version current version steam executed extremely poorly regionlocked gear makes nightmare already hes stacked exploration gear region locked removal skill trees makes progression horrid essentially reset character time move new zonewhat game needs really good tutorialintro phase thrown instructions expected play game fleshed content storylines removal regionlocked gear scaling mobs would betterwollay also tendency vanish communicate community especially viewsopinions explain decided choose concepts ive played nearly hours beta honestly feel deflated waiting years game loved played many years im happy got steam version free owning alpha feel got monies worth playing alpha someone new coming game paying steam id refunding game within minutesenemies hard levelling biome specific itemsall bad bad bad additions game think might go back alpha world weeks hopefully well see wollay listen negative feedback make changeson plus side love map markers ive played since beta launched believe beta better full release game id lying said didnt fun playing full released game id recommend solely visual style alone graphics fantastic voxel style lends well cubeworld bad good things game believe good features far outweigh bad especially price point ive played game hours im done nothing dont buy game bucks even worth half price ive played game hours far lets get one thing straight means bad game different love game hard explains nothing like game like theres hand holding think thing game suffers alpha players players idea play alpha players say game much better progression released version progression goes different view cannot stress enough look things game theres lot wont explain pretty fresh perspective rpgs game getting bashed people arent giving chance rather complain like old version complain difficult theres nothing would recommend game highly ive played game plenty alpha version let tell current state really lackingtons features got gutted completely removed game people got promised back completely different game main problem progression system resets progress every new region went rpg fashioned game roguelike genre experience gained killing monsters thus sense killing running simulator one quest another eventually gather enough information locate artifact yes artifacts way level collect keep bonuses another region seems okayish dont even provide combat stats sailing speed nice memewhile gear taken another region got plus modifier certainly easy find additionally area plus equipment still effective regions heavily limited ranged based circle picked means could range like blocks another region next youre really unluckyin years waited release wollay developer never released update alpha players never responded community however sometimes posted pictures content get added games final form percent proclaimed content even game experience system got gutted january year pretty much made whole new game like months makes sense right really looking id rather wait another years actually get something good ive played game since alpha enjoyed every stage playing game likely put least dozen hours game honestly progression mechanics different games want experience system levels game isnt however love exploration based progression system ive almost completed region game satisfying look things ive completed game starting feel like conquest much area conquer anyway love game definitely recommend ive played game since steam ive probably logged hours game alone lot fun playing friends im glad see make steam worked well ive played game since first came years ago clocked around hours friends blast remember fond times exploring areasclearing dungeonsmobsgetting petsclearing map fogand overall messing around first heard game going finally released steami much hope started playing prerelease version ive let severely game empty shell former self honestly cannot recommend ive read comments agree degree sides pain get new gear fun friend see groups npcs adventuring together thats none subtle hint get friend friend gets really fun soloing opinion fun ive really enjoyed coming back game six year wait like exploration taming pets seeing beautiful sights fun often onesided combat encounters game definitely worth playing shift rpg grindkill enemies game encourages exploration took getting used im completely boardtheres something nice looking map picking locations look like might secret gear placing stars places want see setting see find along way planning routes based gear would faster get boat riding pet makes look world broader sense creates excitement around youll encounter reduces fatigue comes typical rpg grindartifacts underwhelming definitely need better effect ingame whether thats significant boost base stats something else encourages exploration revealing map markers x type location showing npcs talk map marking specific pet random boss locations theyre nice memento ive ive really enjoyed beta felt less grindy alpha new progression systems felt like breath fresh air theyre without problems region region progression definitely feel great definitely speed go zones get resources gear gear works adjacent regionsi definitely recommend game honestly fun sit mates play however id like see progression system expanded id wholeheartedly recommend game people regardless fun beta think people havent played alpha would still enjoy game ive waited years game update let alone come steam came years ago played almost month nonstop many gave hope years ago faith wane though always part believedfast forward years later today finally becoming realunfortunately progression system isnt something enjoy im still happy came doesnt feel like game played years ago still recommend cute style fun exploration though finish first zone may want keep playing still solid hours fun ive waited years wasnt disapointed played beta official game released ive clocked many hours region locking feel extends games replayability whats bad thing theres bugs get patched day theyre discovered thats nice love wollay keep amazing work pixxie ive waited years post reviewcube world timeless classic adventure exploration genre beta could use work overall enjoy ive waited six years fine dont think wait days great title anyone likes rpgs questing exploration try verygoodgame ive watched alpha years ago loved always wanted apart taken play mind numbingly boring empty id rather play trove progression gone game nothing implemented replace think good idea leveling gone skill trees everything rpg isnt also thought people joking region locked items thing insane made think smart rpg suggestion final verdict dont buy game alpha got right alpha rpg elements like many others played cube world alpha expected game changed lot couldve good thing made game better many would agree however game made better many years developers inactive okay roguelikes games progression shortlived might enjoy cube world game little disappointing especially much enjoyed alpha much like many others high hopes game turning quite game region locking happened hope died wanted like game stands letdown fucking love gameeveryone hating honest playing region lock grew region lock system prevents losing quests although similar feel unique fun every hardcore difficulty makes learning difficult fun imho wollay pixxie took money ran threads deleted information deleted basically website disappeared like feeling going release care updating im sad cause really wanted like game despite negativity relaxing game incredible gameplay cute nice like exploremaybe price little lower like everything waited least years aside rendering bein playable tad bit disappointed way renders overall good experience lots less room run around without stick around loading thought typical rpg levels max caps skill system worry quick loop fight gear fight clear dungeons go new land repeat love game friends system doesnt sound appealing may wanna steer clear one absolute best party play games ive ever played friends easy join together go new region basically enjoy condensed mmo regularly play eith people fact hours least coop partner like playing mmo together without needing grind end game wait queue dungeons stuff party friend friends anytime gear together kill dungeon hours youve got mechanics downthe combat fast simple learn fun master definitely recommend cube world heres link first hour start warrior class character enjoy honest trying play game played alpha years excited game finally came steam quickly found current version nothing like alpha relearned game played span weeks gathering everything getting new high level gear decided go new location put way back started every mode transportation items removed found quickly whenever enter new zone gear put back lowest level need full set gear zone get bland quickly assume game much fun friends everyone spawning separate location find city fly single location luckily free however take large amount time depending spawns feel like changes made sake innovation rather fun wallay put years life game working wife thank even issues running around friends amidst pure chaos fun worth issues people still fixed get could still get alpha would recommend game playing new version hours went back played latest believe better xp loot skill progression go back alpha focus adding content systems interact one mistake seen many times early access games creator release really cool experience great reception change drastically original vision instead expanding made early versions struck gold trying make something perfect already exactly needed much appreciate creators attempt deal issues shouldnt completely reworked game lot fun playing latest alpha moment im level warrior riding camel desert couldnt even kill anything new version wollay removes region lock items adds appropriate scaling better stat boosts artefacts games new levelling system fresh fun breaking mould traditional rpg levelling systems grinding enemies etc whole artefacts level idea intriguing executed poorly nominal stat boosts per artefact fixed fantastic system based exploration creating fresh dynamic experience however case right recommend buy game yet fixes patches come game superb worth money anyone tells get game get anyway probably beautiful chill yet action packed game play admit years kinda long also well worth wait need remember one person made entire game loved alpha version much better people need calm stop giving negative reviews wait changed current version alpha release new buyers would think impressive update leads believe current version sharted means publish game steam enough changes alpha wasnt simply rereleasing obvious cashgrab yet still blatantly cashgrab makes question development done additions strange gimmicks nobody really cares like mage able float npcs giving quests lore etc changes alpha arent additions near wholesale awful b dont buy dont support dev b doesnt come back worth unless mod takes someone defendexplain game fun provide guide make fun probably isnt fun game games like dwarf fortress need guide understandmake fun simple minecraft inspired adventure game shouldnt hard get intousually alpha time listen users bugs features likedislike etc maybe form roadmap achieve something based input ignoring everyone making game want play end game probably want play progression alpha felt slow start progression beta nonexistent converted skill trees dust deleted sense true progression kind leveling relics boost minor movement stats reward hours dumped dungeon crawling gem crushed dust like dreams fans mixed button id use iti fun version alpha incredibly flawed recommend different type person would recommend alpha wasnt region lock would give positive review real couldnt stick original plan add excited game come alpha much promise road map exciting exactly looking earth would add region lock small biomes preach exploration yet punish wants running randomly get dismounted earth would want quest get rains every time want leave biome doesnt work dont understand could posibly think could wolfram von funcked game bad reintroduce leveling system make feel like actually progressing zone reset progress would play recommend right repetitive easily updated needs alphaid recommend wait major update remakes game back alpha years ago would happy things currently isnt yet want believe time devs wont disappear without word communitys requests taken account im leaving positive review want encourage dev continue working game think currently great game u liked alpha cant promise u like talking alpha version would completely recommended itbut really feels like neutered version fun things loved game gone granted add quality life features content content doesnt mean better game everything terms actual gameplay made unfunit really shame ever fix game id happily jump back onboard looking forward years thinking buying game would recomend finding mods like first buy mod actually super fun xp progression mods came alpha extremely disappointed new game dont future expectations updatewise grab saleif plan playing alone definitely get saleif plan playing friends worth full price didnt play alpha friends remotely interesting didnt play alpha honestly recommend game due popular belief ive enjoyed hell game although changes werent best game still enjoyable didnt play alpha maybe youll enjoy bound get old really quick regions work game isnt even grindfest resets gear borderline useless enter new zone unless happen find special gear keep stats surrounding regionssome quest items youll get help find get loot get point itll likely accidental encounter running next region loot wont matter anymorei dont want judge game based alpha playing game long periods time ruined aspects game look lot better eyes dont find game fun anymore wont say awful purchase friends looking time sink might work good enough game keep running background default run long load screens queue timers playing games although thats want isnt good value dont already know situation general youll certainly able read around reviews area internet generalthe release version different alpha enjoyable sureits lot like roguelite without fail condition got lotta new enemies new dungeons new biomes wetlands particularly awesome deadlands subbiomes like dark forest new skills new challenges fun right enjoy loosing progression time change zone go go game expectation another procedural minecraftlike rpg focused game going bad time cause plenty alreadyyou tell game trying tackle issue make vertically scaling rpg endlessly explorable hit max level everything becomes trivial region locking items useful region puts reset button progression go new area fresh perspective ill admit isnt perfect execution making feel hours still level barely halfway completing region system new exciting experimental bucks definitely get moneys worth tell plenty room grow game never played previous version cube world please read reviewthe reason reviews mixed lot players played cube world alpha version unhappy state game release level progression system changed since alpha well gamechanging factors ultimately expectations high suddenly droppednow let review game somebody never played cube world prior purchase days agothis game interesting leveling system yes region contains least one artifact get exploring region talking people obtaining better gear artifact gives slight upgrade something level progression gear doesnt transfer regions meaning start grind lot fun enjoy unique system game follows system definitely everyone though another aspect game enjoy exploration exploration forced thats would expect open world adventure game exploration game opinion done well never get bored wandering around could hours adventure scenery game gives truly magical appeal puts positive mood mention game best map function ever witnessed game conclude game magical experience full superlative adventure hours content level system different difficult get used offputting reviews game try let change viewpoint game since lot biased towards previous version somebody playing game first time absolutely recommend game looking exciting adventure havent played alpha might like joined recently game fun challengingif youve since alpha keep complaining grow start playing find hard situationlook throughout town find quests find weapons shop wont enough yaplay couple biomes type game isnt youive waiting game ever since alpha still love love graphics vibe sad endresult turned could betterstill love waiting game long time want open world explore love sweet simple lines pixel art might perfect like engaging fast paced rewarding combat game like completionist game personal hellat time review items stats region locked use equipment area found wouldnt bad werent fact every area far small work since items way increase power could legendary gear one area moment leave another end started gamei personally lot fun combat system insanely addictive would enjoy purely combat focused experience wait sale get game currently nothing offer youthe things opinion would fix grievances game areremove region lock equipmentreintroduce exp system alphaadd artifact effects type end goal like exploring explorings sake simple combat questing allows challenge reward abilities explore impunity focus cube world truly massive amount lands exploreif dont enjoy discovering small things like respawn beacons crazy cave networks wandering roads forested hills dont bother really focus game entire make like grinding repeat reason grind progress grinding reset reason game anyone else move along nothing see like kind proc gen game youre always excited see whats around next corner next hill game absolutely worth twenty bucks region gear thing pretty much exactly like leveling mmo gear date soon move zones without pressure gear able play friends id rather get new gear time spend hours trying find perfect piece liked cube world youll like however im recommending game feels game went forward steps went back classes subclasses much fun play game boring skills always available real progression build artifacts much gamble artifact got meter boost lantern radius important part rpg dev added much new better content game yet obliterated core loop something makes want quit complete region bought play didnt wait progression fixed liked alpha youll like core gameplay stable loop zones fairly short need progressed relatively independently worth money spent years ago love mobile games love played alpha hours honestly say version better see paper new system sounds great way put game seems like development weeks every region enter last game needs least years development even close fully finished right worth picking around dollars current price worth seems like game still prealpha type stage games worth money waste loved enjoyed exploration adventure sense progression cube world knew years ago beg youbdont buy gamebwell dont buy iyeti isnt game loved years ago version cube world completely butchered exploration aspect game regionlocking gear get region forcing start pretty much scratch every time move region borders enough make anyone put game old fan new fanthis version also completely gutted sense progression got alpha version skill tree even uentire leveling systemu removed skills unlocked getgo makes sense rpg get levels collecting artifacts provide minute nonregionlocked buffs character topic characters seeds worlds cant generate world video explains thoughts clearly url things change review stand negative played alpha enjoyed beta basically game without everything made game fun hopefully another years waiting game worth money spent played alpha enjoyed likely wont enjoy thisif want kinda cheap kinda fun game play maybe kids sure start reading review please read whole thing played alpha version bunch friends cousins years ago absolute blast amazing game especially alpha version high respect wolley choice take time develop game private time severely disappointed played friends cousins barrowed account time went buy one shop closed anxiously awaited release full cube world finally announced could hardly contain read reviews crushed game seamed like absolute crap everything enjoyed alpha gone replaced abominations like region locked equipment bought game see found true game completely changed initially extraordinarily mad playing hour two found still good fun game cube world alpha simply two completely different games cant compared would like judging apples flavor orange game looks amazing simple yet fun versatile combat system love quests dungeons blast go trough overworld super fun explore region locked system means always equal terms playing friends could start new adventure anytime wanted go back old one great game price would recommend especially friends play still many things miss alpha honestly think could released two separate games allowing mod support game would also hugely beneficial opinion still alpha game much better game think game anything like alpha youre kinda right mostly wrong game looks nicer gameplay lacks progression fun play current state want polished robust version cube worlds alpha gameplay wont get vanilla want skill trees experience dont buy gameif want try new game new experimental progression mechanics development guestcube worlds current version vastly different game previous self progression completely different far experimental design skilltrees experience enemies scale wanted cube world old might keep waitinghowever big fan cube world wait customary years enjoy fan mods add various features much requested community distance based regional gear want brainless grinding work towards goal doesnt exist work mcdonalds dont buy trash want explore interesting world gear based progression might like gameunfortunately rpgs like level spend skill points interesting options gradually get stronger take tougher tougher enemies gear based route youll go ass handed pick decent weapon point youll instantly start destroying everything none sounds bad might like game people like id stay away want play game youre better cracking alpha version want play game recommend sticking versions arent steam theyre much better chill devs bring speed want preserve love cube world alpha stay away version took away best parts want spend hours trying figure survive actually thrive first zone load leave zone progress gets thrown window heres game game nothing like old version good way im change case change bad makes progress game pointless ultimately making game pointless want support dev ran away like years ago feel free support himbut everyone else got head still buythe hole game got many problems fix game seen update long timeso better reporting game steam save hard earned money ever enchanted old alpha release cube world long ago waste time thisnothing really added since original early alpha release six years ago perceivable changes build back vs removal content fact im disappointed despite expectations beyond already played back

funthe feeling exploring huge open vast world full unknown completely gone none planned features website implemented youre looking fun rpg youve heard ruined spend money something else youre looking buy dont game going waste space computer matter size game may bethis game great potential alpha years development little communication dev stripped life become soulless husk couldve great gamethe game

save money fixed likely wont youve never played game remember watching videos game wait sale game fun enough lose track time theres enough hold months end game great potential wollay one person dont expect game updated constantly youve played alpha game years ago chances wont enjoy game current state biggest problem game sense progression almost completely stripped alpha could level put points towards different skillstrees use certain gear youre high enough level admittedly even system gameplay extremely slow beginning elements removed however longer feels like control interaction come across enemies way strong start cant even cheese experience rare lower level encounters youll end avoiding enemies encounter removing combat viable source entertainment ive told friends talk townspeople go quests special artifacts gear seem worth given fact items underwhelming giving stats lung capacity underwater items also region locked could good thing finding godtier gear set rest game take fun however current system work especially frustrating multiplayer friends may find something useful spawn literally km away surely wollay come system fitting thanossnapping inventory every time cross bordertldr shear amount game mechanics changed worse discouraging often make game feel like walking simulator action rpg game hopefully much criticism game receiving rn wollay make changes

free current state really fun hours wants quests region loot based progression doesnt work isnt fun current state cannot recommend game core game lot potential current state wonder developed last years alpha much better game opinion current state game enjoyable like alpha trust developer hope changes things game mechanicsso ill give positive feedback mark esteem im sure game amasing game one two updates current state theres really enough content make want play longyou get artifact great glide slightly faster wow took hours get point start scratch againno thanks give something useful artifacts make worth grinding like run speed attack multiplieralso add workshop let people make thingsalso whats deal stealth game completely useless first attack dont kill one hit whats point stealth allmage warrior good choices especially coopalso tell us passive effect icons meanand let us know pet requires food without us google current state theres lot missing game lacking lot want waste money still go buy something else anything reallyupdate decided mod game removed region lock enemyweapon scaling like old alpha also better stats artifacts makes useful better mod game change mechanics fun game thats good game mod actually enjoyed game bit recommend wasting money current state game literally unplayable actually kinda funny years ago abandoned cube world far enjoyable seemed polished half hours play time got special items something never described wasnt able get gear mobs around high level even wanted fight cant damage even one level say havent able experience starting scratch zone ability run little faster sucks see game always wanted kid turn way hope get better though uncertain terms recommend game anyone put hundreds hours alpha back unimaginably excited game finally announced release six years twitter update teases thought going amazing additions game instead got shallow experience possible game entirely less features alpha build released six years priorprosthe music niceteleporting shrines cool guessconstowns villages wholly uninspired seemingly coherent layout npcs constantly run wallsthis game rpg levels exp gain enemies scaled classic scale difficulty green weak purple yellow strong matter strength every enemy almost assuredly one shot youterrain generation absurd fog war keep guessing whats beyond horizon look anything anywhere map time theres surprises visually see castle across ocean mapregion locked progression starting new character less equivalent entering new biome gear vanishes good luck hanggliding certainly fall death cross another zone unless get lucky rare dropped gear equipment also useless find everything thing keep artifacts give like buff diminishes additional biome explored skills upgrading skills removed outright fun spamming ult hiding tree kill stuffevery quest iteration go kill everything quest log varietyi marking review received free paid six years ago cannot recommend game anyone like paying new car waiting six years repair cars frame thing get back ive bamboozled last time year silence many changes made game though changes shown looked incredibly promising end result trips falls incredibly flat lack experience points deincentivizes players fighting lowlevel enemies attempt get stronger region locking gear deincentivizes players branching different provinces looking rare artifacts artifacts giving relatively useless stat bonuses deincentivizes players actually completing dungeons reward borderline insulting progression meant make player feel strong visiting previous undefeated foes vanquishing swift blows felt satisfying area copypasted preset dungeons large empty map meant never knew youd end next whole map shown effectively ruins explorationi understand attempt continuous stream content end game gameplay stays fresh new attacksspells learn incentive actually play game explore feeling reward progression everything gameplay start end feel like choreone thing ill give game multiplayer built seamlesslyon another note base specs run game entirely changed since alpha game cannot run lowend systems whatsoever due poor gpu optimizationwollay back ignoring criticisms game keeps id stay away game wait big sale nowhere near worth current stateif want experience best still flawed right version game download bootleg alpha online works multiplayer steam release cube world progression circular meaning wind right back started go new region gear gets hefty nerf stat wise take region found reverted normal brought back home region gear icon travel slightly without degrading degrade like normal gear given enough regional distancepermanent progression earned collecting artifacts stay character forever give boost stats related exploration boating hanggliding diving etc lamp buff artifacts add meters additional light radiusthe opinion part enjoyed playing latest version cube world bit time went found less less entertained game progression loop didnt hooked long comparing alpha game seems shorter less robust content wise found overall disappointed game went years cannot personally recommend gamefinal verdict like see buy dont dont beginning wasnt really fully enjoying cube world felt hardly able progress character first hours quite attuned playing progression system cube world gear based progression system many games like games also player level meaningful impact character stats abilitiesskills cube world skill trees level affect character dont get xp slaying monsters level proving worth lighting fires temple power locations slaying powerful monster level character means lot less adventurerpg games strength cube world entirely dependent gear took time get comfortable accepted started playing rather system started really enjoying fact dont mindlessly kill npcs gain xp progress great thing focus exploration avoid unnecessary combatin start game character quite weak common white enemies dont drop good gear either realized reason progressing slowly set right priorities starting second character found fastest way progressing early crafting freeing trapped trader gnomes world quests fast possible depending class need different materials crafting starter gear warrior run straight nearest mountain landscape mine iron ingots hunter find plant based fiber near forrests trees youve crafted start white green color coded quests progress quickly many criticize game region locking gear get think neat feature get gear drops zone carry zones depending kingdom attuned dont start every time change zone kept two yellowgold gear items first zone blue lvl gear level went adjecent zone dont start every zone drop power bit ive changed zones three times think actually good mechanic means fully complete first zone god figure essentially still challenging zones also means change zone whenever want without enemies lot stronger would force progress within certain region moving really feels like open world sense go anywhere progress fairly taking away means fast travel riding sailing gliding zone dont really mind youve moved zone easily fly around eagle every town want go something wont afford first zone ways traveling second zone start convenient anyways fly items pick think game great game lot charm progression curve makes exploring zones world fun fair id honestly like seeing system open world games beginning game pretty difficult understand play pretty fun current state cant recommend really loved cube world youre gonna exploration rpg game remove skill points punish exploration region locked gear cant surprised community taking well ive done two regions im already exhausted game feel like im never progressing meaningless nobody cares swimming speed current state worth playing current state game cannot recommend purchasing way game works explore zone completing quests gain gear searching legendary artifact hidden within zone unlock different travel tools example boat hanglider collect respawnfast travel points within map find artifact learn makes lantern grant additional meters light go next zone unless lucky get gear weapons armor try sail next area boat longer works either biggest flaw game right may well make new character soon get legendary gear worthwhile reward continue exploring within hours fully geared wandering around hoping npc give quest instead telling cool armor waited years game release instead getting improvements game stagnated lost features current state game isnt fun put endless hours alpha solo freinds loved itbut progress reset whenever go new area fun plain simplealpha fun enjoyable experience state game right wouldnt recommend getting game potential amazing really great exploration right game consists completing areas map basically missions sense progression getting small buffs meaningless stats dont need way getting small buffs completing region take around couple hours complete complete region continue next items pretty much useless meaning dont carry important items help travel map thats pretty much entire game story sense progression nothing couple hours entertainment thats figure even start like said earlier game potential something amazing taking step wrong direction hope helps time took alpha wollay perfected world generation algorithm forgot originally made game good decided make completely different game people like games current state dollars maybe hour hmm different rest regret suggest look serious critique cubeworld honesty pretty much hit bullseye dartboard alpha content fun new game name cubeworld dont expect much exploration sandbox fun youll quickly find finishing first zone get repeat exact thing gear although brought new regions applicable surrounding region aquired making fairly useless leveling useless exploring fun sometimesi look forward updates going need iti enjoyed didnt hard say honestly fun soul suckingly boring points incomplete game loving community ignored developers recently silenced giving feedbackif continues happen game still boring unsatisfying overall wasted potential promised much years later nothing show wouldnt mind sold ip company work game get rid wollaypixxie development process game might become something next something even terraria minecraftif really wanna try game potentially refund get feel new player experience im certain like insane game lot fun need updated rly instead fleshing fun wollay removed best mechanics somehow even managed invalidate exploration something personally loved alpha cute fun good good game better cube world alpha yes good game well almost currently major thing needs fixing far im concerned progression like game going artifact system lantern radius hours playtime really would like see skills subclasses content etcoverall core good needs fixingup different alpha yes still good yes im enjoying thats counts meedit changed negative abandoning game immediately publishing steam going dark like jack bauer shameful playable yesis wanted nocould better yesis dev coming back nois worth money nothis game isnt actually bad tiered equipment enemies bad way progresssing dungeons good get complete set star gear somewhat challenging times game really fun considerable amount dothat finish everything region move next region lose special items boats hang gliders etc items reverted trash tier get keep items stored separate tab specific region work move back region use completely removed desire carry playing progressing well enjoying game im punished exploring one key aspects game also invincible troll pretty fun needs work beta game good state however reason people think lot people blame region locked gear reason game isnt could wrong core game cube world amazingly designed real primary issue artifacts items level character grant utility bonuses like breath time lantern radius transport speed doesnt work combatcentric game permanent progression especially regionlocked modes transportif artifacts nonlinearly ie straight stats combat related cube worlds state would improve hundredfold even problems could wholeheartedly call great game good news wollay likely make changes aspect game still recommend still quite novel experience impressive automatic generation release version steam different alpha yepdid developer take unique approach matching zones players yepare ton cool ideas could enabled game yepdoes make released game garbage nopei spent months engrossed alpha years ago im speaking lack experience played beta daily week hurt sit played painthis good game game game alpha nowas alpha version game years ago yesi dont think looking game standard rpg experiencewollay wanted make game different opinion great jobthe game works locking items specific zonesin one zones find everything need great playthrough owni understand frustration lacking progression zone zonethe artifacts arent great completing big dungeon doesnt feel rewarding opinionhowever want get enjoyment game highly recommend teaming friends conquering zones time way enjoy multiple playthroughs different biomesits like starting new terraria game except instead loading new world cross border whole new zone awaits like cube world flaws cut wollay slack made game pretty much himselfand think pretty great job really fun friends alone hardhopefully well soon get updates easily improved changed lot since alpha still like lot focused exploration questing could great game hope wollay updates game time like sometimes doesnt give lot go know incredibly fun game little repetitive fun feels like lot stuff removed see dont think bad game means leveling system might seem dumb think provides incentive actually explore lands go gear cannot taken lands could could sweep map go straight artifacts level think game many cool mechanics think see wollay trying think come game cant wait see updates future feels like working towards nothing gets repetitve quick losing ability ride mount enter new region makes exploring new regions bother good great add description pet food pet food didnt describe used pet interesting developement say little bit scared first due various changes example xp anymore level finding artifacts dungeons strength increases gear lose progress leave land without completing first also motivates lot one region find npcs town game gets going get quests find interesting locations loved game years ago want love today update review time goes see turns lot issues mostly terms balancing difficulty balancing loot fun mod theres amazing mod lets use equipment tools anywhere makes game really come lifedo hope fix issue cut content absolutely hope eventually fix lot design issues way keeps game feeling immediately bland soon get relic yes hope add skill trees players pursue definitelyits recommendation solely soundtrack atmosphere mounts gameplay general control scheme etc feel really good perfect game even closeget mod play friend good timeheres hoping gets patched improved lot potential meeting satisfying quotas music gameplay story mechanics yet hope future updates bring glories behold changed alot since alpha believe still one fun games ive played quite less content charm years development mind blowing alpha enjoyed thoroughlya great game taken progression entirely gear biomelocked character gear based get unlucky spawn take hours find first town anything help die enemies encounter honestly glad got code played better game would pay save money different game good game hit ground hard progression goes pattern difficulty high starting makes people get drawn away start become strong make super fun absolutely destroy things would shot beginning getting artifacts region buff stat permanently catch artifacts affect combat affect useless stats swim speed stamina climbing also transfer another region finished one good equipment brings equipment star removes utilities thats community upset game finish region restarting game new character hope dev wollay fix game live reputation alpha good game things make people cry first people dislike change get used new region locked gear artifact system becomes pretty fun balancing issues especially start game hard time dungeonsofcourse dislike fact removed exp traditional levels game lot potential good already game promised game different therefore backlash first wollay fixes balancing maybe adds back kind skill tree traditional levels really nice give game potential become future lets take easy hope wollay might fix things lets hope player base also matures bit sidenote people freaking way much calm good game fun exploration game worth price good game pretty fun aswell fun game region locking system items sucks wonderful game enjoy finding many different fantastic things never seen always sad experience see game going something enjoyable entertaining actually good something piece shit cube world alpha amazing progression depth felt amazing explore world current state play region leave literally back square one gave new version shot tried enjoy really bad save time money avoid game like plague best cube game better alpha see people complaining zoning systemi remember playing alpha getting certain level enemies become easy mode easy new zoning system doesnt matter strong first zone move next gear reset making hunt loot rewarding personally like iti think version far better alpha good work worth wait definitely worth hopefully continue working make even better fun iq fun beginning kinda boring needs update play fun modded allow progression like game used also remove unnecessarily tedious issuesbetter friends suretoo bad leveling skill tree removed feels like already everything start game fun play start get biomes becomes really boring really quick thing fight boss get gear change biome repeat great except small problems one thing dont like u specific weapons biomes think u able use weapon ever u go everything else pretty good far nice closure unfortunately isnt anything like direction game going alpha long term progression movement speeds yes lame everything else reset enter new regionthe main idea see trying make region sort largescale dungeon similar zelda get map compass dungeon regain navigation tools reupgrade shops things pretty interesting idea im actually onboard execution poor theres nothing rewarding definitely think could worked needs large redesign concept fun play game years ago much less content feels unrewarding dont let nostalgia take hold worth price tag really hard recommend recommend game looking game feels complete full content replay value recommend especially buy game expectation significant changes updates beyond bug fixes also ingame help need find tips getting started guides get brutal unexplained early game ultimately recommend game reasons people going expect complete game game enjoyable things well becomes stale quickly motivation continue exploring new regions see new biomes world gen fantastic except oceans opinion explore new areas deal losing gear tools hang glider boat reigns riding pet etc exploration hindered slowed grind gear upi dont hate direction wollay took game could accept regionlocked gear incentive keep exploring new areas artifacts highest rewards region feel rewarding simple utility boosts like letting swim tiny bit faster lamp illuminate tiny bit furtherultimately recommend educate decide current state game worth dont mind grinding gear seeing beautiful world gen go ahead get enjoy otherwise follow game check month two see changes made developer given indication seen criticism plans explore changes improve areas community thinks lacking fun friends online also game fun play friends well good really enjoy playing especially friends isnt good isnt quite yetthe game lacks rewarding feel efforts feel vain especially region locking experience systems games past great seemed one draws many people play entirely absenti highly respect wollay pixxie dedication work put producing game however game much lacking core elements needs keep players playing missing ones make game enjoyable rewarding throughout progress pacing slow draining taken away user moves next zonei hours game find hard encourage keep playing even time invested feel progressed nowhere new player would likely appear advanced wasnt good repetitive gear region locked really progression progression game minimal sometimes get lucky within minute youre late game progression system region locked gear games fine gets kinda boring pretty quick kind sucks gameloop boring repetitive seems built artificially prolong gameplay alpha better ways also bad would recommend buying wolly steal everyones money ran last time looked like good game friend showed alpha game still looks nice fun friends meh looks like minecraft plays like zelda breath wild felt like weapons dont breakthe games focus exploration world appears infinite really easy play friends ask flight master send seconds later protip press space bar steer hang glider otherwise landing might rough drops way theremonsters come grades star stars gear needed defeat themin zone youll collecting items work specifically zone pay attention end item name items relatively rare work areas theyre valuable even theyre worse currently havethe game expects fully explore one area go onto next gear items really help dont start zero second time aroundsome fights tough easier friends theres crafting relevant endgame theres chance learn crafting recipe two gear every areathere cute environmental puzzlesthere many pets ride help fightsthe problem starting difficult carefully pick fights dont attack anything stars gear manage youll die lot theres real penalty fights zergable friends spawn point nearbyoh speaking pro tips spawn points see one shrines run press e play tune shrine marked map blue dot click dot anywhere world get teleported difficult figure beginning obvious save frustrationyou notice mixed reviews game got review bombed people played alpha prefer old numbercrunchy progression made every zone explore first rather irrelevant like way better theres less math less obsolete contentone last tip whatever class end playing try different weapons make big difference offering interesting attack modes timing tricks may repetitive goal involved still fun run around friend two kill time sure leveling system anything stats kinda gone thats alright im certain eventually updated future better include content may game wanted still enjoy day may live hype alpha even fullest potential god dam game good fun relaxing might like originalit might best game hopeless causebut fact edit game mods makes game hopelessat core really nice game assuming dont cheat spam items stats fly something play game used game great waywith region unlock mod scaling enemy difficulty game great nothing else really neededthe one thing make game better though make sure friends xdthis games enjoyment goes play friends adventure game sucks getting ambushed open world game xd good really amazing idea make game rewarding point clearing anything first region really pains write review waiting long playing much goesthis game shadow former self could stomach playing hours im die hard fan cube world general played since waited several long years actual release recommend game anyone wanting experience alpha hadwollay changed lot lot really things expect xp killing monsters lots quests although quickly become repetitive im already sick rescuing gnomes witches cultists region locked equipment probably controversial change sucks limits progression also valid boats gliders reins forcing stay region even artifacts increase useless movement speed stats dont even work find special items region unlock certain locations necessary progress inside region found tthere bugs though sometimes may find one items region might become unclearable skill trees get skils class right bat stamina based instead cooldown based except ultimate cant combo skill rotations like alpha shrine transportation thankfully great change discover shrines place activate teleport time without cost making travelling back forth lot easier quicker randomly generated worls create seed share friends different biomes still thing probably reason made play game much real difference change regions mostly visual changes scenerymost changes make feel like youre playing completely different game alpha followed wollay post history knows promised seems like played breath wild something decided nowhere change core mechanics game entirely literally nobody ever wanted asked thatthis game longer action rpg exploration adventure exploration game rpg elements thereim saying game bad different even though promised different product bad simply doesnt work exploration game punishes exploring far supposed sacrifice heavy grinding rpg freedom exploration became much grindier ever depend gear enemies drop means still need kill mobs low chance getting gear supposed endless adventure pretty much experience entire power cycle inside region always start weak beat weak enemies must escape strong ones eventually become strong steamroll every single enemy region except couple mobs power level get region become weak resetting cycle instead continuing itand make matters even worse lot bugs map generation quests sometime dont work necessary key items spawn region wollay literally disappeared social media refuses listen public updated game since release till date review dont think hell ever make changes completely silent absentwe promised lot things cut instead got mostly functional game shallow dont think need keep playing clearing first region regions pretty much thing big adventure illusion supposed swallow happy withi hope developer someday listens something highly doubt ever happen pray modders leats fiddle around give us supposed get sadly another cashgrab game better spending bucks something creator actually cares plays game seems like game gutted pretty decent alpha wait purchase better game still requires work love sucks previous alpha version better hard six years developed thing takes patience bu still fun keeps original feel game also great fun multiplayer game maker good job balancing difficulty playability would maybe made items permanent complete reset every continent maybe armour least takes time get used fun takes time warm newer progression system start questing receiving great gear blast playing difficult game sadly group friends worth took years finish ruining game old alpha amazing though lacking content gave pretty early wandering around minutes trying find mobs elites nothing dying less enjoyable wollay thought recommend even trying game unless got free options available took time still enjoyable gameif youve waiting eagerly might disappointed werent expecting anything particular pleasedmuch love wollay waaaaas nice game great game even better belive change region lock would make players actually happy game enjoyable keep great work wollay fun hours theres point finish one zone zones big enough begin features seem zonesi dont understand series poor choices development fun still fun ride beaver battle fun begining realised region locks fun play years ago cant believe waited years recieved bad game people like running around achieving anything like feel progression something im getting dont know game going updated certaintly hope anywho probably going back way thus far highly dissapointing dont feel like anything done really since last updated felt like game sincerely hope changes loved game back could play reason turned game sick talk across map get avoiding enemies firstly attack die second attack litterary dont gain anything better sure theres content mechanics arent meits like mentioned really fun realized already played entire game couple hours one reasons got excited really fun first place idea would keep giving new quests like saving guy monsters different unique quests repeating one also thought would level get new abilities something cool playing entire game basically got level realized get levels every time play entire game expected way unique mobs expected unique towns perhaps even cities stuff explore basically ideas made game exciting loved excitementbut yeah understand thats seemingly impossible goal two people achieve thats right path though concept game really got surprisingly excited worth wasnt worth wait went cool leveling exploring rpg alpha item based rpg without levels generic explorer without nothing world first review sadly also negative onethe current game fun people expecting alpha version promisedthe gear based progression bad rng still major factor finding equipment actually progress unlike alpha longer level overcome minor issues like finding better weapon whileregion locked gear whoever thought good idea current form never tested gameplay loopyou lose progress made start maybe piece carry lucky enough thrown back grinding hellthe game barebones best removed many fun features alpha promisedteased pasti advice people buy game several iterations core gameplay loop happened youre buying beta best term fun give hours fun replaying game hours mediocre fun isnt worth wont run cannot play gameupdate windows asus rog motherboard needed look task manager halt nahimics audio programs running actually worked first time able play cube world game gorgeous really love visual style havent minutes game really appreciate polish ill write later okthe alpha way fun currently equipment system kinda strange cant take upgraded stuff new zones zones equipment specific stupid point free roam progress reset every square area enteralso skill system gorecommend reluctant disappointing lot bit different old version lack skill tree exp dislike feels like different game new one feels like test patience although dont mind kind feels like alienating enjoy interacting npcs new objects aim give game really nice exploration feel like game dont use wiki work really get experience understand mean combat feels pretty evolved enjoy like still feel might satisfaction finding stuff leveling beautiful game feeling adventure definetly present cute game personally liked alpha better fond memories saw announced excited impulsively bought copy wife got could immediately tell something sadly felt like exciting adventure grindy job game doesnt sense achievement wife couldnt stand barely hours gave sad see appreciate effort though back day really sad hear devs rough time developing game trying enjoy lives gaming industry really ruthless decent game region lock isnt bad wish could keep key items going another region yet contrast alpha adds gameplay loop going new region weak nothing conquer individual section land region start get gear thatll help fight regions wish didnt pick every key item every region also tutorial sort guide start could help players dont stop playing getting every mob isnt chicken fun cute game thats fun play friends gets bit repetetive continued updates see issues game get fixed fun game high points alpha enjoy like new features version fun game hope add leveling system kill things get xp take away things fun game needs deeper rpg elements fun game need little patience start ive much fun completing first zone learned acquire gear slowly work way quests found breeze sure im illusion beta hey like going development kinda like new progression system liked gearing much cant wait zone twoi alpha backer like many kind give years back im pleased cube world isnt dead back track looking forward new things future fun game good game play friends fun game bugs simple well made game cant wait till wolfarm updates im happy got moved steam finally got give something amazing times ive game know game isnt complete yet im willing wait years next year know lot controversy game doesnt change fact fun game fun game issues currently waiting update may never come fun game lacks appeal alpha version though addition npcs quests players wanted enough make many simplified mechanics introduced cube world current version seems confused supposed mechanics discourage exploration beyond given area world may nearly infinite without real way develop character doubt players would continue playing clearing starting area fun little game play lot open world adventure games like final fantasy xi xiv skyrim fallout series actually cute little game takes mb storage world huge explore one thing doesnt level ups like final fantasy games mentioned depends weapons armors give boostfun little game really like itjust test played gt gb ran smooth issues played gtx gb card parts map stutters fps even getting game takes forever god damn shame im willing change mind wollay fix gamethere glaring issuesremoved exp skill treesregion one tied one see old system new zones harder effect new one next zone youre weakest enemies stronger new system makes hard earned gear becomes useless new zone shattering feeling progressionin old system paths grow stronger leveling eq new system instead exp grinding youre grinding mobs hope would drop better eq ocean zone alpha remember filled fishesmobs one empty clearing ocean zone saw single fish shark funnily enough wasnt even water walking rather crawling beach also clearing ocean zone better pray find boat asap travel vast blue void sometimes cant even see islands horizon render distance minimap would questioning anything ahead youre slowly swimming hope find boatinstead exp relics amazing amazingly terrible mean boosting speed combat like gliding riding etc travel faster youre lucky find traveling items zone might spend hours current game second enter next zone relic perks useless since access traveling items find new zone dont forget gear useless well oh stocked crafting materials could afford crafting amazing gear tough luck cuz blueprints also region locked suddenly clue use materials youve using last zoneold version game could progress new zone youd get beat hard barely could face tough enemies previous zone version youve cleared zone youve seen least game youre lucky next zone could say youve beat game nothing new waiting next zonethis video sum terrible changes made alphahttpsyoutube like current game clearly either never played alpha long enough forgot good alpha cant wait either dev update fixadd old good stuff modders step good game needs updates could example sky whistle spirit bell treasure spirit lute disapears boat climbing spikes hang glider reins dont good game needs changes region locking core items like boats gliders ext idc region locking armor powered good armor whole entire game future changes want game combat abilities classes new artifacts influence combat overall good game price changes stop weeping alpha cucks good game good friends funny geim good game wasnt meant accept creator likely going change anything fun good sound track wasnt promised definitely wasnt alpha people looking harshly think good game good game let tell everyone playing expected laid alpha however alpha subject change wasnt entirely convinced changes first either fact even posted places much hated buddy got play awhile figured main thing need explore take advantage fact items town shops rotate every day midnight talk every npc say dumb shit rest give quest locations build slowly required gear start trying complete quests gear score youre water biome start hopping large islands map boat almost always somewhere thats easy find mostly land biome recommend trying find riding reins save lot time scroll map look around structures trouble finding things star middle mouse button mapfinally dont think changing regions started fun focused region eventually get region gear sometimes shop even sells white rarity region gear stick inventory later change regionsoverall good game major changes hope review help guys fun game dont forget still working reason took long two people developing game doubt make living good game dont like need start every new point great casual game exploration dungeon crawling thanks wollay great game compared old version new version lot things new monsters new plots new objects heroic abilities rich npc dialogues diverse terrain pets grow strength heroes also see things havent done well disappearance seabed organisms topography marine ecology treasures normally acquired terrain terrain gaps terrain drops lead special doors unable stop players nice game ive waited much game niche game think lot negative reviews unwarranted enjoying game past hours released recommend playing friends see could bit dulli dont get hate towards progression think promising past hours liked progressioni hope wollay keep working game like pretty good game leave starting region progress caries pet rare weapons extend surrounding regions isnt really point fighting anymore dropped leveling system skill tree besides however game enjoyable id recommend buying game sale pretty good game game isnt everyone enjoy like tried something new mainly referring gear region lock system quite different alpha version enjoy challenge new area start useless gear seem tedious times nice feature playing friends matter long friends played play even level think good improvements would small permanent stat boosts combat skills instead travel skills seem pretty pointless longer varied reins item region locked ride pets anywhere walking slow world basically infiniteif positive content changes continued get added think ill start enjoy even real shame couldve masterpiece good enjoy voxel art running around quests exploring colorful world dont get game really fun enjoyable game wollay really improved game something proud however might everyones taste progression system completely different alpha rpgs game still improved many ways high hopes really fun game first fifteen hours gets kind repetitive play friends still fun youre playing alone dont expect get lot different gameplay really fun game quite learning curve sometimes feels like start bit still really neat concept shame game got bombarded negative reviews trolls seems thing common nowadays sadthe current game focuses exploration make feel like rediscovering world time tought solo game really enjoyable fun friends great exploration experience shame really loved alpha version game could get websidei got right dev went silent thought working bigger update kept waitingi waited waited little found seemingly disappeard internetso many promises heldmany features implementedmany problems gameplay resetting everything entering different areaits shame happened game developer went silent releasing thisdont get try get alpha much fun good game honestly shouldnt taken levels talent trees levels brought accomplishment feeling game year wait still well built game still needing polish lot stuff game overall would recommend game want challenging fun coop rpg game interesting unique game even alpha better fun fun realize developer manipulative liar baits community years rewards love loyalty whatever bullsht game fun bit especially youre friends refuse recommend game developer treats community like imagine ordering hamburger fries end receiving singular fry postit sticking says hamorger wouldnt surprised woolay dev pretends depressed second time poor launch game steam come back us years later new update adds helicopters wonder reviews like happens alright alpha better terms combat version better terms bug fixes adventure game explore places rinse repeat much depth anymore gear mostly region locked get gear degrades adjacent zones still better starting scratchits worth got hours kill friends enjoyable game old one lot fun basically alpha cube world guess scraped made thats potential good game doesnt mutch content old alpha world looks better years since ive played game alpha phase cannot remember spent much time playing thisstill fun play group friends bit mindless time consumingmore come many years making patience paid cube world proven unique adventure game game vast stunning adventure honestly cant recommend enough im really glad made friend joining polished overall better hoped forone important note die lot especially first lose nothing die time lose sort punishment big beautiful cumbersometheres interesting game cant get way ui could compelling leveling destroys progress regions monsters wildly outside power levelyet world beautiful inviting desire see needs updates certainly alpha ive played region ive spawned far really damn hard enjoying dont think negative feedback really necessarygood points lore cool new terrain generation think addictive fun combat generally fun quest lines nice music animations pretty cool new attacks petting animals fast travel alpha desperate need neater inventory cool new creatures much fun dungeons many good concepts game playbad points quite slow difficult first lack exp system removal old toolbarmoveset characters region lock gear somewhat repetitive quest system old controls felt natural thats preference removal certain old features exp systemskill tree need unlock respawn shrines using go far distance without finding shrine killed something powerful quickly end back started havent unlocked shrineover enjoying playing game really dont think hate necessary id recommend game new player trying wouldnt recommend avid fan alpha definitely good game fair price expect get game alpha different opinion worse hope content future thats hope thing want say enjoy playing game strengths weaknesses different years ago love game many quests items gather friends make great lot people problem items reseting go new biome fun experience collecting new items opinion like change give game different alpha something everyone empty people claim alpha empty nothing game something behind every corner dont skilltree would nice get sense progression artifacts gear gear even op one area start new one still gear im excited future updates still enjoy game much years ago different alpha better alpha nahstill good game yes different alpha vast amount core loop changed dramatically longer level forever progress game akin looping legend zelda zone new world worth requiring pretty much start unless grinded enough get hands legendary gear even usable zones next one got meaning need start thing personally ive got gripes loops moment namely fact leveling pretty pointless get artifact increases misc skill like swimming ridding ive yet seen one anything combat based sure thing relying gear makes dungeons feel pointless boat extremely early zone want slight decrease stamina usage swimming dont get wrong enjoy game good play long new content features dont fit well personally emptyi spent first minutes trying figure check quests see way check youve spoken npc times afterwardsthe next minutes spent holding w reached gnome wasnt even trouble traderthen found hang glider mountain neat jumped started gliding minute fell sky death glider disappeared amazing designive known cube world since around store originally went expected years game would different id seen nope pretty much lose progress lotthis game nowhere near worth towards spend money actual game even better alpha must buy finally seriously enjoyed game would recommend othersthe features quite fun examples glider petsthere one feature dislike region exclusive stuff due fact dont keep itemsbut hey maybe thats fun addictive visual style cute looks awesome fun play offline like train flight fun pretty fun miss lot alpha fun friends dont attempt play game fun kind hate sound design lags bit proton linux worth sure fun lack real progression means game gets stale hours hours enjoyment looking recommend fun likehalf hour hour gets boring pretty quickly hadnt played boyfriend im sure would gotten boring even sooner graphics look pretty cute relaxing play thats game doesnt offer really much gigantic map cant really anything personally love exploring justdidnt motivation game everything theres really anything explore imo idkid love diversity game make something huge world spawn id love explore worth right fun least fun quite gets super repetitive completing regions quests quests recycled different zones hardly diversity theres real progression thing work towards gaining levels give menial stats lamp radius riding speed sailing speed etc shame tbh fun first regions fun big fan new leveling system fun get bitthe start game take little need time get first pieces equipment get rolling becomes fun explore world fight mobs especially together friends really nicenow game may perfect way much room improvement im already enjoying state cube world feel fairly certain changes future lot good game fun understand play things workthe biggest problem nothing explained need go though forums order understand things working certain way straightforward one would assume games author biggest sin hes made quite serious changes without justifying also explaining fun youre geared play game fun run like schmo green blue enemies enter new land gear suddenly doesnt work feet east fun play friends hours cleared chunks already bored cant even imagine playing fun friends imo fun still fun dont go expecting major updates game creator went silent launch fun starting new sections probably seems super tedious best way think fun getting explore new place bottom really fun fun think kid game continue entertained adventure long time older audiences starting scratch every zone starts drag time think game lot potential glorious alpha days youre older gamer expect get couple days still recommend getting game ive definitely put moneys worth honestly enjoyed time far funny game went years developer wollay disappearing teasing things disappearing without actually releasing updates hes showing fast forward game releases everyone excited play new content none updates teased game content original game removed point somehow less content originaloh wait isnt funny big messto put things short game longer form xp levelling skill tree learned new abilities also gone along abilities theres barely reason anything anymore top game split biomes cross new biome gear previous biome dissapears theres levels youre basically starting lost progresswollay probably gone like past years dont buy unless comes back actually fixes issues good different alpha missing things developers seem best man team mean week beta week fixed lot bugs short time span compared mostit seems changed directions mid production whether good bad opinion based personally think nice constant need get new gear new regions alpha possible get point one shot everything rewarding get though becomes easy unenjoyable though thats say could better way approach always im saying see attempt made keep feel growing constant wed prefer including mestill though content updates come bettering qol hopefullyim good reviews hope point acrosstldr game good trying dobut want specifically anticipatingstill good though hope content pushed better good gamei enjoyed itbut theres almost year nowno updatei cant take anymore got charming art combat pretty decent figure buttons attack game isnt engaging clear first zone figuring clear first zone chore game communicates nothing better ways waste cubeworld got lag issues running proton linux laptop fairly playablea great game great take dungeon delving rpg games great see game pop lot good updates changes game since first appearance must say quite admire work wollay done working game seem lot complaints gear useful region obtained first complained indeed annoying lose progress upon changing zones found way kept things fresh get strong gear start destroying everything actually bad player retention way games avoid losing players way making stronger stronger enemies gear keep player grinding become stronger old cube world used went starting zone enemies would become stronger problem limit game infinite zones neigh impossible keep scaling strength enemies gear every zone instead effect achieved lowering gears level changing zone feel kinda bad stuff taken away return world feels rewarding find special items often constantly getting better gear favorite part feature friends play time without needing worry level whatever simply drop move fresh zone current complaints game pets aside used mount find riding gear pointless hope system get revamped future weapon augmenting via adding voxels really cool pretty pointless reason push strength weapons higher obtained maybe occasional yellow tier boss crafting seldom used id bother happen get access purple yellow tier item means use item nearby zones crafts also really expensive dont plan oftenthats think time guess mention written day released publicly played early access bunch steam hard nice colorful smooth gameplay bit empty happy see back alive long hard give game thumbs downhowever besides horrible horrible lack communication devs supporting win pretty big points game still supported updated people bought game years ago got steam keys game fun play even bit hard get lacking real aim stillon personal sidenote combat lot fun older version though impressive game better full release horrible game used quite enjoyable first came version nothing cube world know love extremely unbalanced exp system completely removed absolutely progression anything enjoyable game want play game thats like old cube world dont expect anything like game would recommend garbage anyone real kinda bad right hopefully wollay improve timethis review wip literally exact thing years ago except favorite features removed released steam hoped get lot new skills items biomes enemies bosses years afterall instead released exact thing less content adding single new enemy would improved game instead took step backwards lost hope game many years ago got back found releasing steam week however seeing weve gotten im left even less hope meh honest nice play game didnt changed lot beginnings journeyi definitely recommend playing bad premise alpha interested almost decade ago didnt age well still feels like early access title back region locked gear system one strangest things ive ever seen think understand practise leads gameplay experience almost feels like punishing exploring otherwise interesting world rpg farm good item became useless another zone finished game great bad either biggest issue game current progression system sucksyou check video review explain bit ultimately recommend enjoy game game gets old progress gets reset go new biome including gear key items travel items exception relics artifacts entire goal game grind relic items relics always hidden inside star dungeon forcing grind gear max get item thatll give swim speedeven manage get enough relics mount speed cant use mount new biome find item map said biome makes entire process relic farming pretty pointlessi would recommend game play biomes done except price bit high considering average playtime probably around hours first biome solo less youre friends released really glitchier back alpha times couldnt even play teammate removes fun game worth money expected necessarily wanted cube worlds progression fun little thing play alone watching youtube another screen blast play online friends progression actually works fairly well game region locked gear major gripe modding community picks steam definitely worth price developmental end point teased like grinding sense progression worth playing even get free worth time whatsoever theres progression system anymore alas nothing keep going forward leveling gone basically getting best gear one region moving another region find stuff previous uselessmind developer accomplished years okay modded game development long really expected much content difference alpha build current one areharmful seems like enemy variety fewer landscape still massive empty quests locations far apart travel portion nearly interesting enough compelling npcs say stuff shallow lore cute addition feels like real value could still call alpha version would fooled mei certainly like game still see overhauled amazing game wish modding community alive definitely dont abandon game wollay okay good hoped beta alpha better opinion would love understand leveling system yeah pretty boring combat isnt really fun buggy hell play trove lol pretty fun youre need fixes multiplayer super laggy one could fixed updatemaybe someday pretty good pretty sparse terms content fun indie game good dont necessarily agree mechanics gear leveling really weird quite diffrent alpha still like really fun play better friends grind interesting bit repetitive really great havent seen previous versions game unbiased opinion like plays good job really sad seeing bad reviews game loved even sad completely garee reviews used love playing cube world always came back feeling exploring levelling getting new better gear feeling longer something experiencing game love world looks smaller biomes better world generation questing system waaaay better thats really important game enhoyable however got eorse many important aread like exploration progression gear traits like riding pet region locked means gear becomes dogshit outside biome got cant level way strange rpg say enjoyable levelling character getting new gear levelling skills felt good play feels bad really hope wollay fix cause unlikely play current state sad couldnt get expected especially loved everything game except game still beautiful game years really like progression inside region beginning cant even kill vegetables properly hours playing slice onions like pro wash radish drain fun game cute new gear system allows much playability progress next level area little bit start playing friends makes even fun truly shame last server cube world finally shuts hope game dwindled announcement game launching steam got excited maybe game isnt dead yet maybe hope left disappointment release removed everything made alpha version fun honestly wollay wants actually give back community genuinely wanted see game well ready support needed release download alpha steam weirdly paced grindy really tried like got bored would better classes items region locked real progression system place enemies extremely harshi adored alpha made alpha great replaced andor removed fun glad able play used play many years ago available lot updates wish tutorial thought things changed past version bit different alpha traditional genre think still really solid game controls super sharp mess settings gameplay diverse class different move sets various weapons well specializations getting rid talent tree bummer like game doesnt tell play learn play messing around killing things overall wish features alpha still great game decent game fun interesting get lot however flaws pretty bad one need play game friends otherwise boring slog bore hour mark also get repetative awhile system enter new zone got start basic weapons good bad allows constant challange wont get place one shot everything get pretty fustrating spending hours zone start overall however solid game repeat need play friends trust wise feel sloggish dull fun game joke compared alpha version game developers didnt touch game released alpha wouldve better unfortunately changed lot stuff made game worse game still fun seriously downgraded shame state really hope devs bring back old version game use instead versionyou buy game youre either bored saleheres alpha review game shows specifically happened fun game fact basically start scratch every time get new area ruins game exploring getting gear feels punishes many people eloquently stated problems game could wont bother cube world isnt fun current state truly hope changes better future stands good game big fan new artifact update theres still time improvemend dislikes people around hour game good game old combat system better like ideas though tons expansion great exploration game friendsthere neat crafting draw items little blocksthis isnt type rpg grind monsters get tonnes exp level bunch junkyou level collecting artifacts make game easier play dont necessarily make strongerif played alpha probably wont like games fault great game followed since first came altho enjoyed game updates lot awesome changes cant agree worth play cant wait see wollay great game work put amazing still rly fun tons cool new things addedi think sees alot us happy new region lock system understand put alot work system us cant completely redo brand new system even old system without changing bunch work years put game ppl need support wife give time overall game great improve sure weeks go great game needs till get used learn everything feels great learn even new things abolutley awesome great game lots content definitely fixes example walk like mins go one mission p nice game u play friends u play alone kind boring lot fun gets kind repetitive fun game payed original alpha enjoyed well new changes gives game replayability player enjoys tougher games challenged alpha power trip level pass everything game wyyy easy awesome game tho would love og features removed open world game never ends gets old great soundtrack gives legend zelda vibes awesome friends becomes boring couple hours different game alpha probably classic rpg cool different alpha still enjoyable gem wont everyones cup tea thoughty wollay pixxie personally got moneys worth fun fun friends think nostalgia initial hype way back scewed view game slightly fun short time leave one region nothing cube world grinding mobs gold weapons armor make progress recommend current stagei bought back early alpha daysot dont know couldnt write prerelease review although activated steam key game available steam people ability waitvalve explain fun cool feels good get new loot long term progression plus dev wife went deleted tweets dev blog looks like packed left scammed us good enough good guess good back really good back good worth buy hard love game bought game first alpha definitely share problems back fell flat super fast dropped almost instantly beta came week ago see people angry region lock system also see whole region lock thing exists prevent instant boredom hitting endgame perhaps enemies scaled power level could good middle ground prevent boredom understand game one man project still lean towards negative side positive side game oh yeah dev also gone ghost releasing game thats pretty cool guess like going meet chick spoken long time online meeting chris hansen like playing early access different gameat least give us option play alphabeta versions first time writing review steam game actually pretty fun tho think region lock kinda dumbbasically first hours game fun u enter new region everything u worked gonei always big fan cube world cant wait future updates bcoz atm game messed good alpha still good game exactly game promised betas whats changed arguably worse aspects though lot changes postivecube world still remains fun game especially fun friends extremely easy use dropdrop multiplayer fun perfect fun time spent farlooking forward seeing future content best fun great exploration mods used cube world cool feels like game missing really hope updates ok worth wait functioning item progression doesnt really make sense traveling new lands require weapons area makes cannot bring fav weapons overall playable fun really fun even better friends really good lot replayability difficult moments though traveling take first starting new area lot fun thing could wish change would multiplayer get fixed moment nearly unplayable due extreme amounts lag ie seconds door tried open opens still good game wasnt supposed except cuz likely creator isnt going change anything fun good sound track wasnt promised definantly weasnt alpha people looking harshly think game compared something else fun buts laggy even great connection worth checking outedit nvm great gamebut everyone without leveling system get lucky find good gear get better gear handle locations help progress game works locations map moment join nothing landscape text waypoints need find achieve talking friendly adventurers walking around area also zoom map try find also something hate understandable respawn system find statues play flute activate respawn fast travell finaly artefacts wich acts level helps movement combat yeah mention gear area locked like thatif recommend game would recommend people like exploring big open world good game something missing like levling grind new spells easier like old beta still extually good game ive playing cubeworld since alphait fundamentally fun game still requires many updates new players confusing tutorial difficult monsters early one clear insight doi like wollay going direction new creative want cube world uniquer game certainly isif continues get significant updates beyond bug fixes highly recommend ive playing cube world past year finally came beta ecstatic wasnt disappointed basically game remember different form progression people used pains see people give game bad reviews clear sense progression people would probably like people complained beta seem know much games change alphas betas sooo ive playing hours must admit different alpha dont think thats bad thing recall people alpha would grind crabs level imo far less enjoyable exploring entire regions level game polished however also know games official launch think agree minecraft didnt much launch either think fun game love replayability regions makes exploration based game wollay creator intended years ago im already level prove game though barebones naked eye still plenty tons charm ive played game years waited progress years im glad game finally coming recent changes core game made indifferent new system statues fun make exploring fun saying zones items pointless makes exploring core part least enjoyable artefacts worth restarting gear items boost get taken away would fine skill tree game hoping gets added back waste without feeling like anything hope change wont recommend things change id say diffrent destroyed get good gear fun mess around get artifacts ive waited years game finally release always following wollays twitter excitement little know would remove best aspect game removing xp system skill tree adding regionlocked gear like actual f shoulda released cubeworld bring back alpha way im playing friends way fun garbage played minutes trying find kill mobs dont exactly hp im going start saying alpha player waited years im honestly really happy disappointed alpha players miss xp feature everything else leveling cube world back day huge pain ass level two took hours reach really didnt much although miss little bit like games ruined lot people also complained items getting way worse honest think encourages exploration fun game lot fun new mechanics everything incredibly fun youre looking open world rpg play players may well game would definitely recommend im going word review basic terms possibly review coming perspective someone actively participating beta period previous week release moment hours record gamecube world open world exploration voxel game wears rpg trappings around like cloak trappings fabricdeep gameplay loop involves player traveling around singular region completing quests region gearing eventually take dungeonslegendary quests obtain artifact region moving onto next region cross another region gear resets basic stats star star player must start grind motivation artifacts however reward offer

piece gear usually weapon cube world game trying new type progression loop sadly doesnt feel like offers much progression strength constantly reset loop replayed en masse motivation presented player collection artifacts dont effect combat centric statisticsi cant good conscience give version cube world release positive review personally game glaring balance flaws im type player enjoys negative reinforcement loop done future game updated issues addressed change review time however currently would give game recommendation buy unless player issue cons stated sounds like type game would enjoy enjoy psa warning shouldnt say please also aware looking game communicative developer cube world game developer regularly speak players host amas etc choice right course however outlook consequences people looking clear roadmap game going evolve critiques game posted many players beta period week prior release words exchanged dev community im honestly incredibly disappointed game turned years get developer gone though mental health issues mean game cant criticized person bought alpha im happy fact design choices made seems attempt cover fact content game super barebones enemies borderline require lure npc groups travelling map killed due fact weapons armour start arent strong enough take weakest enemies without killed hits yes game gear based progression gear drops enemies gear worth gathering gear bought villages still good enough ensure survivalthe major complaint youll hear game fact complete zone cant use items found includes glider find climbing gear every item get via quest get next zone design choice logically makes zero sense unless mask lack content game game solid direction alpha years ago combat worse evasive moves alpha gone skill tree dying sends nearest shrine much walking send minutes away objective youre going top people bought alpha gotten stem key promised ignored devs like years ago issues arosedo buy game unless significant changes made doubt happen person teamvery dissatisfied im recommending game please hear played back aloha years ago incredible current release bit different doesnt mean bad would nice skill tree think developers deliberately didnt include thats fine enjoy game great fun ill continue play negative reviews come people didnt want game change alpha ive waiting game years amazing suggest everyone buy ive waiting game like years honestly wasnt worth every time enter region essentially restart first start game youre extremely levelled resort cheesing ai consistently kill revert alpha please dear god game buggy bad amazing original years ago spend lot time game finding gear getting artifacts downside gear region locked get used find lot better gear level locked makes feel like progressing lot wouldve alpha version set skills already depending class pick changing guild guy also better leveling levels unlock like alpha people rate game bad enjoyed spending hours life collecting good gear one shot every mob game find region locking enjoyable implement keeps game fresh challenge explore world tell think game comments fun played alpha still bugs still fun none less system different one people want doesnt mean badregion locking rather popular complain abouthowever people arent saying creative quite perfectly implemented im hoping minor improvements several rpgs fallen prey solves problem endgame always content challenging content one age old issues rpg fight hardest bosses content get best gear best gear actually youre already done game isnt case cubeworld next region new challenge number creep rpgs huge number scaling problems health damage values start small game scales get ridiculous stop fun see seven digit numbers place youre actually hitting harder mobs scale matter much bigger number cubeworld numbers stay small bosses five digit health thats dont keep getting bigger bigger forever reset back managable next always join friend thats right trouble dealing leveled leveled friend go new region like new game challenge youa lot people acting like region locking absurd basic idea progress resetting like similar prestiging video games get top unlock everything voluntarily go back start maybe minor permanent upgrades design game look region separate new adventure start small fry build way eventually conquer dungeons get best loot well artifacts think idea works wonderfully well time biggest issue artifacts pretty uninspiring slight mobility upgrades advice would make every artifact much bigger effect several dozen combat non combat effect feel also make stack enough likely see new one long timeanyway thats two cents bad whining would lend believe need understand isnt traditional rpg dont think thats bad thing dont need xp bar filling good timethanks reading came back moneyi trusted wollay followed game years never lost hope even recommended game launch encourage fed upno communication september clearly stagged disappointing final game manages less content alpha build years ago reworked worse theres really fun complete region let us use items regions use complete regionit make game even fun doesnt huge amount replayability moment hopefully sort proper progression come game point artifacts download cracked version alpha much greater time find someone share nonsteam alpha play game better part like everyone else waited supported game years happy outcome game lot potential could huge success game hollow repetitive boring idea dev guess neither anyone else lmao like many alpha buyers barely recognized game changed much however looked past saw game started lot fun way progression system built never hit point stagnation plagues many rpgs game always remains challenging allowing infinitely progress explore managed ingame settings already fell love game noits good yet unfinished makes soooo bad gets updated next years yes nonot worth years waited worth price tag worth anyones timea huge waste time money fun potential fun needed changes made whole preogression system needs reworked used hope gets better play alpha forget update came try imagine better future read reviews gaem good clear bad reviews game harsh still great game still one fav games people cant see put expectations high theyve clearly forgot one person working makes sad know people cant open goddamn eyes one second learn game understand wollay human know still beta ive played alpha know may feel fleshed know perfect game know exactly wanted right happy things still change things would like change like artifacts really underbuffed maybe make gear slightly less rare understandable lets ride together fun anythings want changed remember still betahave fun everyone keep going wollay game great youre great job kept playing looking something like really wanting enjoy end extremely repetitious game never actually progress character meaningful way first hour youll throughout entire game still lot potential game ever developed sadly im doubtful killing monsters exploring fun anymore since alpha oh well missing much since forgot game back bought kind feels like developer didnt really know handle weight internet shoulders game exploded first released high praise lots anticipation come fast forward half decade actually maybe decade boom heres sloppy butchered build game plays fundamentally different original stripped whatever made original fun whatever goes bucksdont buy game kind difficult get started addicting better skill skill cap high loot puts roller coaster emotions beta release made polarizing game still worth time thoroughly enjoyed far hours play time kinda bummed payed play hours thought years hype game would better pirated copy didnt pay welp thats way goes please make game open source sure community could actually make really fun unlike current state kinda hurts give negativ reviewthe alpha version way better much fun playing early days kudos developer updating game putting steamthe current version however needs work either revert back old progression system give better reason want first region lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo thanks loved game alpha boy creat better game years lack true progression lackluster content even compared alpha highly recommend picking game various issues progression dealt lacks storyline clear objectives weird mechanics terms progression gameits still good surely better friends time lame progressionno progression system ruined compared alpha good game anymore last tweet september blog deletedwollays reputation yeetedits like decided take page mans sky worse least nms devs kept working game seems like wollays interested taking money running let preface stating rarely feel compelled write negative review game time ive done review mans sky release feel like says lot state game currently bto anyone thinking buying game anywhere near date review would highly recommend save money come back later whenif glaring issues fixed bi bought cube world years years ago proposed features possibilities gave hope game could blossom something really enjoyable purchasing booted alpha make sure worked computer never touched unfortunately seems terrible idea considering game im playing disrespects time game ive played alpha version apparently going much fun direction pains say theres really good skeleton could built something awesome wasnt plagued torturous game design choices bthe goodblist world characters enjoyable look aesthetic light fun variety races choose character good models cute tame pets mounts variety also good theyre adorable little random bits lore get plaques dialogue nice touch game doesnt really require like lot also lot dialogue npcs encounter friendly cute even limited combat youre balanced slightly outofyourleague encounter quite fun engaging played mage weapon functions abilities cool fun exploration initially engaging draws quite well different items improve mobility like boats hang gliders climbing boots etc make traversal fun mage also ability levitate teleport fun use abuse well listbthe badbbeverything related progressing character feels horrible far way glaring problem gameplay tainted poorly handled bthe meaningful way ive seen make character stronger find gear better stats however almost loot find limited zone find means time spent gearing character tackle quests one zone immediately useless step zones borders next includes things like boats hang gliders climbing boots make traversing world faster fun youve finally got boat want go explore neighboring ocean biome claim seas offer well good luck sail border boat disappears youre left either sail way back land swim find boat biome could complete side finally tamed pet want mount found reins well leave biome good luck finding reins pet cant used mount gain levels game way find artifacts hidden around different biomes could interesting things run around discover boons artifacts give things like able hold breath underwater longer bit stamina use gliding hang glider compelling rewarding find bthere sense balanced progression comes enemies within zone either bfrom tell enemies spawned randomly list applicable enemies biome npc given rarityrank come form numbers stars attached name color similar rarity systems games cool idea implementation alongside random enemy spawns found often instantly killed randomly spawned godtier mage archer possessed somethingorother hiding behind tree random smattering extremely powerful enemies walking alongside level goons made almost completely abandon fighting enemies werent tied directly quests addition even choose engage overworld enemies usually drop couple gold coins pet snack lack enemy balance also bleeds dungeons youll sometimes find initial rooms hallways filled easily defeatable creatures smacked face boss kill one hits way health deal damage unless youre able kite around minutes without getting hit getting bugged cheesing fight take long fighting something die run back everything previously killed dungeon respawns gates blocking progress locked right back ties back character progression gear find dungeon useful biome hell would spend bunch time slogging fights get item useless cross line map get artifact thatll give slight buff useless stat bonce complete one biome feel like want move next youre basically starting game everything meaningful youve earned point nullified case would want continue playing first one bwithout doubt game still lot potential big part really hopeful one day come back itll better state however completely dependent entirety character progression lack completely revamped enemies encounters rebalanced work handinhand progression absurd biome limitations removed let say outright dont go game alpha player mindset step back weeks clear mind take whirl youll realize game still quite whirl play around art style cutelycubic combat simplistic fun world feels much alive compared alpha game regionlock big deal ive gotten let start stating like game played alphacube world game nice graphics amazing idea great potential currently final state contains minor bugs enough spend decent amount time hrs might get repetitive region lock whenever go new region lose stuff start solution one might consider downloading mods fix one might able find sites like nexusmods mods think gameplay cubeworld pretty fun especially friends able get hours gamei currently spend hours game know friend even surpassed hoursif want gameplay information cube world suggest watch videos youtube let start saying ive never played alpha game friend got game week launch watched play thought looked pretty fun far great time im saying game perfect handful bugs ive come across dont fully agree core game functions bugs think top head would duplicate pets inventory thought maybe tamed two animal nope named one pulled pet default animal name serious problem one mobs game cant think name look like onionlings hat made blades spin attack youve seen things know im going boss spinning aoe attack reach miles makes impossible get close deal damage youre playing mage youll problem us melee people got chance fucker kills us hits cannot complete quest shit first problem ive got core functions game able use boat spirit bell ect zones go find thing every time cross line new zone second thing artifacts work think good idea poorly executed nobody cares fast boat goes thing speed boat maybe instead climbing speed riding speed max health max mp like said artifacts cool idea lot fun collect wish boosted useful stats thats last thing would change would region locking instead items go gold white go region go gold purple go another region go purple blue game really fun lot enjoyable friends lag problems playing friends youll rubber band seconds everything thats happened around time play speed bad times keeps happening kind annoying worth meh thats honestly worth sale uh yeah let failure arpg fun game general stand testament happens developing alone years without accepting kind feedback betatesting week without accepting kind feedback lets real really good first couple hours later get really pointless tbf worth money long spend game also need respond dev lets forget look game subpar combat seems fun first gets really repetitive limited number skills nothing unlock regard would ok meaty good base combat doesnt explorations well procedural generated youve seen one youve seen fair large enough variety encounter types last biomes thats plus game looks fine sometimes offer really beautiful scenery however game world part feels empty quest system barely existent spam talk everyone see point place marks map lore superficial unengaging crafting system basic seems mostly irrelevant even due region locking equiptment recipes decent fun hours gets repetitive fast shallowness pretty much every system game starts show recommend regional equivalent ever sale might worth grabbing short mindless fun especially plan playing group mods address larger might say mindblowingly questionable design choices issues game however end end highlighting emptyness shallowness game also worth noting developer silent pretty much since release history vanishing anybody even looks slightly unhappy product wouldnt expect ever updated lets progression system rewarding fun hours end remove entirely walk border everything weapons armor boat glider disappears get new boat glider every single zone awful system awful game dont bother level progression getting artifacts regions every time collect one get little bit faster literallythe gear get region gets nullified another unless wear gear case wear adjacent regions got itmissions dont vary much close nothing regionscontent seems lacking hours ive played ive seen see got boredthis game like really love exploration leveling confusing gearloot hard understand direction motive rpg clear good path keeping player interested playing game great would perfect new system really hard get good grip direction finding mobs get loot counter productive loot barely drops mobs harder grind practically damage play realize extremely long grinding game put almost hours even get starting set gear loot drop rate easier might bad leveling system got weird imo love like lot people already written game lot hype big expectations sadly big changes made game ruined fun existed first hours amazing lots fun youre done zone realize hours youve spent basically useless gets kinda dull depressing gameplay throughout youre hoping find gear works zones means u constantly farm like anything game make better worse played game back alpha certainly changed still enjoyable everi absolutely recommend reading guide begin getting hang controls ui tricky firstit seems unlikely devs return game however considering game created twoperson team stands impressive feat unique style playwhile game lack polish direction game worth best played friends like many people bought game back alpha absolute blast play friends got many hours fastforward steam release everything changes many people seem seen bad thing honestly enjoy incentive actually fully explore new region scaled pretty large truly think lot replayability new system excited put hours like many others got alpha game many years ago think version may better although irrelevant game back slightly different game game unfinished uninspired piece garbage idea developer thought would good idea release game state anything rereleased new alpha started cant help feel like took money ran years ago threw piece garbage together released bleed turnip little money unfortunate potential ok rant time actually reviewas game biggest flaw version game giant world many biomescountries explore absolutely reason leave one area due extremely strange design choice armorweaponsitems carry countries im guessing hours worth gameplay item scaling pretty much maxed character doesnt really level experience system items thing cause character improve way inclined go countries pretty much replaying crappy game finished enjoy rpg rougelikes run hour boring unbalanced piece sht guess game might say rougelike closest genre use describe game ruining mechanic replaying experience anyways ive rambled enough typically dont like super negative games game earned kinda wish never officially released could still joke friends checking updates like many waiting hoping game release chance play without torrenting already voiced many others game remember much preferred xp based progression replaced gear effectively resets realm constants relics collect seem provide small boosts things like climbing speed lantern radius theres sense progression outside realm get tired given realm opt find new adventure another forced start scratch effectively negates interest adventuring even collecting materials improve gear let alone crafting feel like theres time fix game issues even ive neglected mention ultimately game feels like nonbo premise advertises loved game first debuted years ago admittedly fun playing first purchased however cannot stress repetitive game feels quickly interest continuing dies sincerely wish wollay picroma best luck game hope realize gear based progression isnt way go almost wish could go back play original version ill stay hopeful wollay realizes far hes strayed original basis game built like others wanted like game really someone would check twice month past years kind news alpha fun wasnt enough content make play long however would absolutely say alpha better full release like many others cant stand region lock lack feeling like made progress hours play time also wasnt expecting massive update alpha full release expecting got wollay spend last years working game chance hell honestly would surprised worked month accumulated time game past years another sad note seems wollay gone one knows ever add anything game thankfully fans passionate game modders saviors game give us asking want game good like liked alpha beta get boring whilebut someone made mod made game much enjoyablebut game worth wouldnt get hopes cube world liked didnt like addicted yeet liked alpha versio game since game changed alot never grew like release versio maybe grew pun intented listen game used better alpha fact new zone go makes cant use current stuff needs removed would really love play game new content still game system zone go farther first zone gets harder like alpha listen get game reinvented multiple times years dont understand version decided call good enough sure added nice quality life things npc interactions fast travel got rid everything made cube world game jumping friends chaining dungeons get elemental pieces could augment weapons leveling meaningful ways lots templescavesdungeons take real sense progression reason reviews low reason people complaining honestly would ended better took money run dig hole track record take another years tried get version really gives incentive play isnt fun want succeed really going long way go interested playing find version alpha play instead save bucks reinvents state better consider buying literally meaningful progression thanks region lock little new content years almost everything scrapped sidegrades downgrades various unanimously loved aspects game infinite randomly generated maps crafting experience levels gear doesnt become useless leave tiny bit land looted etceven feel like saying bad cant say better complete game way feel like theres much less still potentially fun itll likely never history changing game could beeneven starbound mans sky likes better lauch dev still refuses communicate fanbase dishonest salvageable probably dev swallows pride overcomes fears stops going hiding doesnt try run away launch profits takes matters hands listens feedback tries make compromises updates game content improvements community much happier perhaps even willing continue supporting game even reverted alpha version continued slowly update finish game people would probably much happier chances happening close null im sure jaded fans ready forgive anytime soon eithersad see much wasted potential steep price become lmao ddos gave man depression reading reviews gonna send straight shadow realm lmao imagine woollay actually caring feedback dumpster fireone hasnt posted twitter since september happened release game updates enjoy game trash statecheers cubeworld lol much better long story short played alpha liked itplayed beta still really like long time alpha player games combat mechanics

limited gear annoying leveling system disappeared game alpha basically better even content lots bad reviews peoples broken expectations game expected world wollay course dissapoined didnt release wanted look game without preconceptions fun entertaining game instead infinite leveling system mobs getting harder harder progress throught game wollay decided nurf character instead buffing monsters game progression rightfully annoy lot people game designed infinitly randomly generated world would bit silly mister powerful away beginning think people would less annoyed wollay made region locking items relivent law explain happens love keep good work love always loved wish key gear didnt disappear moving new zone find handglider boat times gets pretty annoying love concept would great game could pull ignorant development actually stripped away things game loved original alpha releaseunless great change affected game improve gameplay systems avoid titlethis game unfinished ridiculous cashgrab game actually presents love game although one thing bothering quest glitch save person enemies finished got loot reward map showed quest finishdone check alright minutes pass suddenly unchecks went completed time didnt get loot shows quest finished every minutes unchecks never quest goes forever dont get loot quest big deal doesnt show map finished annoying otherwise great game cant wait play love game also hoping future updates maybe stuff like housing love game ive played alpha version hundreds hours enjoyed every minute new content amazing dungeons new pets glider mechanics quest system especially things dont like unfortunately leveling system region loot skill trees lack lack skill trees makes leveling seem pointless getting diving skill isnt exactly usefull could choose points going would alot better adding skills might help well character movement speed increased attack speed damageregion loot seems kind silly things like glider boat especially reins incredibly frustrating noticed ocean biomes spawn boat first non village island land help alot reins large land biomes really sucks liked old version buy glider forever goes boat ability ride pets locked behind skill points unlocked forever character reset weapons armor top feel like im starting new character every biome wonder want progress character mean somethingapart things changes vast improvement older version hope review given good ideasthank giving us update always wanted maybe next time dont make us wait long love visuals audiolove classes races customizationlove explorationnot

great spite strange ghosting went still back working lets get rid crappy area itemlock figure something else right youre punished exploration game made brilliant exploration loved alpha desisions progression systems overhaul bit bumpy ill still play lot thoughit least stay region feel like actual open world adventuring searching completing quests lot games genres fail think mainly procedural generation world makes everything find feel unique even though limited pool quests honestly think best way fix game fun hundreds hours like alpha completely overhaul progression system region locking feels like robs everything earned cross border essentially maybe go back exp system like maybe keep loot based keep scaling numbers dont know could still keep artifacts permanent bonuses think require bit impact unless made easier get loved simple infinite progression originalhell would love version exact new quest system loved game alpha still love yes things changed still lots funwould love travel artifacts persistent across areas would also make artifact progression meaningful gear thing doesnt really bother much maybe travel items bunch gold meaning dunno ill playing game regardless blast loved game since alpha thought game might never see light day lot changed since alpha making lot people question would go route region locking personally love new style game think makes endless fun without friends overall think issues game need ironed think wollay improve time lvl system meh overall pretty fun mainly hear make positive review cancel someones whiny self entitled review besides game fun came still fun play friends entitled brat friends get game simple major downgrade core gameplay loop progression system alpha version guess happens break trust paying customers develop years echo chamber make game make great people borderline worship disappear years come back update makes game simpler easier less content get end cube world waste time wait years make cube world great cant belive took years make sure talk npcs quests quest system game interesting unique gamethe game definitely gotten better since alpha days still major potential developer keeps rolling updates either wait reaches maximum purchase play along progressesill provide better review time play game make favor dont buy game least state man really wish love game cant man game clearing kind dungeon found one chests got excited chest would contain relic relic containing ancient lost power would get keep regions opened chest hoping wasnt going get something garbage like cool new skill good rare weapon like rare pet food rare cool pet please prayed give something awesomemy prayers answered hands held crown crown increased lamp radius oh wouldnt believe happy sarcasm aside dont think game

real heartbreak man first heard cubeworld officially getting released tears joy hard recommend game cause much fun alpha justbetterdont get wrong game went sale like id recommend otherwise worth money clearing regions game pretty much fully played reality openworld game progression deep desert many content earlier alpha game missing makes game whole new better game many already voiced opinion thoroughly care however truly find wrong repeatedly tease numerous features people support release game include wollays sparse content updates fans years must quite aware picture game painting whether intentionally misleading followers gain interest truly intended develop things failed know however game feels less balanced beta version years ago barely additional content released passion project years state leads believe lost passion interest development cube world long ago merely attempt make money moving said still pleasant experience cant imagine people getting hours play youve seen content least twice wollay communicative changes least shown semblance care community people loved game years believe game could something special truly sad see turn like highly doubtful continue development game past point many others already detail explained problems game part agree gotten alpha interesting play nostalgia exploring one region intentions go another region redo running around looking loot overall benefit progress slightly larger lamp radius would barely recommend freetoplay many others wrote extensive reviews im gonna keep short game current state absolute disappointment made cubeworld fun endless exploration character progression gone fun alpha keep away massive changes core gameplay cubeworld personally like game also lacking many features promised picroma website wollay game enjoyable game purchased years ago one would buy massive disappointment alpha players watched game suddenly lose features try current state reward game gives completing regions small extension leaves reason play game combat never changes never gain skills shining moments first dungeons make pulls dungeons dont many tiles underdesigned saving grace game multiplayer made easy said dont rope friends buying dont buy basically idle clicker game without getting see numbers get bigger massive disappointment really feels like every new feature since alpha years ago makes game worse top removed bunch things well massive disappointment waiting literally almost half life im disappointed im writing review made refund request wollay please make game feel like alpha feels barebones massive step wrong direction hadhave high hopes game alpha cw fantastic base set stall much added already decent game lacking content way quests like ive idea prompted wollay redo scratch hope reverts similar state adding extra content came beta cant recommend unfortunately massively flawed region locked gear system lose progress walk far maybe give timei recommend game enjoying im forgiving person find fitting fairly nicely niche game different beast polarizing say leastmy hope game receive expansion future devs known silence general dont mind see deal breaks lot peopleif want use reviews good idea kind game check helpful section unless gets abused show reviews best describe arguments friends bought game released many years ago game alpha expected updated wollay ended abandoning game years must scrapped everything last month release ended reason hours friends tried hard like would lying said didnt good moments would much better purchasing terraria minecraft much better game design decisions game really make wonder wollay made certain decisions discussing laughing decisions part fun dont buy game although slight glimmer hope continue update game good engine meet cube world game lot potential developer abandoned game isnt bad actually enjoyed lot friends game okay im going give game idea functions already built actually kind cool youre indie developer best way abandon game leaving completely personally believe shall allow parts community modding even complete game feelings best thing look fallout fallout completely buggy bethesda allowed modding allowed many people add thousands upon thousands better solutions another point stable game one engine stable enough run without community bug fixing garrys mod time favorite game community developers thing garry team worry serious bugs memories good anymore still fun recommended might saddest thing steami like waited years think needs know people hate region thing dont like stuck see new couldnt keep first time experience may key like back first played also get friends key stand right worth eyes get sale might taste games didnt really grasp attention like alpha im gonna say updates changes dont recommend perspective million times better like back wouldve better creator open communicated audiencethough im really updating steam nomination award task thingy majig dont really care anymore miss old one good way missing core elements like combat progression xp start scratch time travel new zoneregion huge setback game compared alpha version lot potential good changes made taking away core elements

modded heard mod came using rn games good get mod fixes issues guys great game fucking love game much reminds good ol days better things love much im happy mods hope game see got mod games quite fun mods saved game half features teased promised arent pog game ever even years kappguys plz help complete trash likely get repetitive would expect greater range challenges years however game enjoyable far expect keep enjoying long new updates add new quests variety game prolonged game play issue rpg elements stripped game reason gear region locking terrible idea alpha map system also way better great encouragement exploration idea changed seems like something really good decided remove good parts things people complaining easily fixed mods perfect game pretty good definitely bad people make seem us know remember alpha truly piece gold piece poop im trying hateful dont understand whole core game changed loved alpha build cubeworld really good potencial needed add things would perfectbut nothing promised main website future plans goneim really sad disapointed could great game chill work reviews youll read always bring new biome leveling system true disappointment anyone looking alpha footage game nothing like could youre signing aesthetic old leveling game appeals new audience one ever part old prerelease crew personally dislike new game accept call ive since learned isnt specifically want ive seen enjoyable suddenly find leveling definitely repetitive good someone wants destress explore randomly dont think youre getting use understand youre getting game steam still good game different one much better alpha still small price tag leveling system bit confusing understand works gets better im glad made landscape much interesting explore tho want fly one blimpsdown steel empire mugged even free felt robbed multi optimized game nice lacks content updatesnice game would like see updated tho multiplayer laggy isnt fun alpha opinionpros nice arstyle gives exploration vibe lore stuff combat system interestingcons hard reset every biome except itemslore real perpose game whiseone lucky drop set biomemy ideas give lore perpuse combining lore core game playso u kinda could follow story jsut paper fight monster get loot special rewards renable level system gives reason kill anything else boss gold every thing isnt worth biggest issue game stems dev team taking years develop game taking single bit criticism fanbase let cubeworld go history cautionary tale happens develop games bubble without feed back people actually expect pay play product think negativity couldve easily avoided detailed poll discussion asking fans kind features theyd prefer stay change removed completely fans never given option instead blind sided game nothing like one already learned expect baffling design decisions although dedicated patient individuals may find fun still believe disappointment game far promised shown us beginning hope one day wollay wife take feedback consideration reboot game mans sky style give people really wanted get go brother bought game alpha loved every second back underpowered pc month ago started sharing progress new update twitter couldnt help get excited since got beta key immediately started playing soon came us noticed changed took getting used toi want take portion review thank wollay pixxie personally since brought much joy years ago theyve manged bring childlike joy back older man thank much hard work let bad reviews slow guys merely meant constructive criticism even structured tad bit aggressivei also want say even though new update feels like completely different game like whole lot update bring new biomes procedurally generated quests breath fresh air cube world formula love music new dungeons well new races brought id personally love play jester race complaints think everyone else thinking regionlocking weapon progression anyone doesnt know region locking speak weapons armor items gliders boats divine harp etc bound region still get use weapons armor severely debuffed allow clean slate new region almost feels like groundhogs day different map layout would prefer wasnt regionlocked instead throwing legendaries region maybe dedicate region different color white regions easy yellow regions although tough could reap insanely high reward believe would keep elongate game yet give clearer end goal also please give us gliders boats permanently theyre fun mess around hate find one regionlastly weapon progression started got butt whooped time time kept trying different quests would easy enough handle without cheesing found mission beat got op blue greatsword destroyed everything path ease game jolted favor breezed everything got way support region color code idea make player work get best region get artifact let level go next region color scale progression would lot linearmaybe nostalgia kind miss skill tree xpdropping enemies dont think inclusive would make opinion game much higher even though complaints pretty lengthy still highly recommend game anyone maybe im playing game though rosetinted nostalgia glasses glad nonetheless wollay generous enough lay enormous update usthank wollay pixxie personally hope guys continue work game importantly hope guys happy thank computer relatively decent specs runs game perfectly fine frame rate doesnt matter cant see centimetres ahead methere pause even single player cant wait environment load every time move somewhere new blue fog consumes areas leave turned render distance way nothing waited hour standing around loads slightly unloads everything immediately leave area add everything still environment enemies water items cant see itthese areas still exist cant see technically possible navigate via map real time nice guess obstacles enemies still load idea killing half time literally cant see themreally wanted enjoy one girlfriend extreme lag computer render distance fine render distance version combine make unplayable mess dont know bug exclusive something computer hopefully fixed quickly dont even care goes like fps let see going computer quite shit therefore hard time running gamebut love game works years freaking awesome deserve love computer meets recommended specs completely unplayable lowest render distance things running background refunded immediately might check game later gets optimized better something dissapointment immersuralble day ruinedwhy implement clusterfuck progression system perfectly viable one alpha character cant progress besides gear region locked even abilities like riding pets gliding region locked selfdefeating purpose exploration want encourage people explore system shouldnt punish players leave new landscreate alternative mode game implements old gamesystem like advertised dont react wall silence cant handle pressure years since alpha seem decided say bother create different game skin cubeworld topi bought game play friends expectation would rpg like intentionally advertised rouge like selfhating shitfest favorite food ginseng soup fiance excited found coming reviews started going negative reading zone based gear got skeptical waited day deciding get try glad enjoy game thoroughly know lot people arent happy ones got alpha persons perspective didnt play alphafirst zone based gear know huge topic debate gear wasnt zone based soon finished first zone got best gear could easily start blasting zones wouldnt take long finish bunch crafting books zone would pointless wouldnt need materials crafting would become pointless well would need crafting starting new zone bad everyone making get keep mats easily craft starting gear collected enough also farm plus gear yet stay zone long enough bit daunting build new gear long know class fine also take advantage npcs world pulling enemies help defeat really need tomaterials zone restricted find spot load materials need make bunch gear mark map later visiting anytime especially find things like emeralds sapphires rubies diamonds materials brought zone zone stock piling things help greatly next zone quickly work better gear without grind hoursartifactsare pretty useless yes one point contestation game far aside dark night gets believe artifacts slightly enhance combat stats stead traveling ones traveling ones make pointless yes goal finish zone get artifact tbhthey feel like lot effort little reward artifacts got changed slightly enhance one combat skills light radius probably wouldnt mind would love themnighttime game sucks love idea game following normal day barely see light radius problem night lasts far long go sit town wait barely see order anything luckily see slightly farther fiance probably tv slightly brighter reason see enhancing light radius useful right find artifact itive heard useless find bunch havent found light radius ones well collected quite artifacts several different characters night didnt last long slightly brighter could barely see front feet wouldnt bad want artifact artifacts going still based pointless travel skills see night ft front characterpets amazing thing game point love finding pet food go tame new one love ride region find reigns dont like pets like shepherd dog example tamable right see shepherd dog looks amazing unlike collie terrier scottish terrier food tame shepherd dog seems wrongto end would say give game try form opinion esp didnt play alpha almost didnt based reviews wouldve mistake hours time writing review think definitely gotten monies worth esp seeing know going keep playing would love see classes get added know fiance excited see type mods come game gets easier friends well friends thinking life become easier still unsure always go find game play twitch youtube etc see think game play looks like something would like great doesnt potentially saved money thanks reading first review steam give thoughts gameso know game lets look closer game really badi played hours straight alone another hours cousinand say mean fun though also disappointed dont understand everything every choice wollay different game alpha starts bit slow dont know basically weak fucki dont mind hard games love dark souls every souls game dont mind mobs hard kill fun meand important change abilities changed keys keyboard middle mouse left shift r thats weird beginningat first armor like armours items region locked items name arent region locked well kind region locked go next area still use go far diminish like gear taken far obtained items bigger range work multiple regions need grind long find guess get armor quests somehow lucky got one could use next region wellon reddit saw comment finish region every gear name dont know true didnt finish region yetthe best option killing every boss enemy found exploring honest play coop arena region need find teleportation point near arena one die keep reviving run back arena life points dont reset dont know thats supposed happen thats farm every quests resets midnight go sleep village make quest till better gear thats dont think gear progression bad still dont like region locking stuffso armor items skills artefactswell every region find artefact yes level upyou find artefacts every land level gear firstso means gain levels finding artefacts levels raise stats least much mean provide small buffs permanent somewhat similar one point old skill tree also kind weird mean get lore see artefacts locations map thats least something guess still artefacts dungeons castles still need better stuff make dungeon guess back grinding killing monsters like chickenwhen played cube world cousin found pretty sick equipment looked dungeon artifact yes found one holy macaroni dungeons pretty sick really love loved every enemy every boss everything thought yes first artifact hell yeah well fucking increase riding skill like actual fuck dont even pet yea first impression artifact wollay make better well pretty simple wollay good programmer knows want least hope could make artifacts rewarding increase riding skill beating big dungeon good reward get artifact two stats like hp armor increase little two stats like riding swimming skill would rewarding fucking riding onlyhow find items talk npcs thats important find items landso tested multiplayer well cousin played found town region holy shit useless people petrified didnt know change googled guy reddit said need find people town petrified dont know one doesnt matter cause searched fucking hour guy know still didnt find thats really annoying lets move went another region proof armor really gets weaker items found dont work anymore surprise surprise since new region armor und items got useless mean equip armor good items inventory useless thats nicei mean armours one thing sure dont mind much players fuck cant take items another region glidersboatssome items arent permanent anymore like fuck would leave boat glider one region find new one another region thats annoying thinkmany complaint game xp levelling system like said level many say killing monsters useless well thats true need monsters new armor stuff gold think thats sounds clearly killing monsters important get better maybe dont big brain like everyone else complaining right nowso skill tree yes thats weird well cant level skills stuff like cant choose skill like alpha mean every skill beginning thats nice dont get iti mean dont mind arent getting xp anymore artifacts level dont know get boring good quests every land quest main quest little instruction would nice wollay thought would know something game know shitmost time walk game mean tried kill many mobs possible still need find npcs get quest walk another point thats probably site mapand couple time ago wollay said something building system game like would love build house region like happened hoped game sadly notfor map zoom much search everything region every stone cube life shrine tip mine mark everything map looks interesting every house everythingi like game somehow guess game choices made strange honest would prefer skill tree would nice hating wollay anyone game looks finished honest prefer alpha absolutely loved game still love alpha dont like game much mean really disappointed maybe hyped game dont know stuff wollay beta really dont like maybe need time get used itbut still dont see future game starting basically new every region great reward know dont start nothing next area gear still losing equipment found isnt nice dont change levels next area first area normal next area next one one maybe wrong game developer trying helpand know would love take stuff wollay added beta put alpha would amazing still recommend game fun finish first region thanks reading first game review dont judge couldnt stand back see negativity slightly unpolished gemthe game first steps real release impatient many years im happy finally offical already thought game deadnow biggest negativ points everyone experience already made equipment useable regions use equipment extra surrounding regionsscreenshot proof found sword extra legendary castle go regions away location found cant use properly anymore least cant play friend cause high distance travel eagle city friend directly free currently level ups collect artifacts stats get slight boost give level also see screenshots im level collected artifact also stayed went regions away classes special skills class skills also change specialization example rogue class ninja assassin true many skills skilltree im hoping change futurestill im hoping good updates near future hope cube world community still support game gets positiv attention likely pushed updates ppl buy push positivity p first six hours game wonderful played two friends blast exploring finding new gear quests ectafter nothing upon entering second biome found stats reduced nothing yellow legendary gear gray gear gear region locked besides rare gear find isnt locked adjacent zones crafting gear improving completely pointless start new biome movement equipment reigns mount pets boats ect also region locked boating ocean sudden boat disappear find things every zone order use themthe progression leveling game based around finding artifacts final dungeons zones take hours get thing increase stats mounted speed glider speed ect actual combat progression literally start every zoneother game fun youre comfortable paying six hours content id say give try beyond cant recommend game current stateupdate developers deleted facebook pages game bug reporting threads developer blogroadmap looks like wollay pulling another wollay dont expect updates game certainly dont buy first thought played game excellent game since release years ago exp system hard starting extremely hard find mobs actually killother good gamedont buy fix region lock playable friend gave gift guess enjoying wanted play togetherafter hour playing really dont like game find boring empty confusing seriously lacking objective sortthis game looked awesome videos experienced nothing like heck supposed get start theremy friend said need use guide even quests certainly arent obvious find ridiculous dont believe game hold hand dont think toss obvious quests goals even damn leveling system tell everything bland dont want play anymore regret purchased alpha cant get refundthis game isnt originally intended advertised everything everyone enjoyed alpha gone place kind halfassed breath wild wannabe except botw fun game many decisions devs made leave scratching head anyone could think gameplay loop would enjoyable longevity beyond youve done one every biome arent huge amount youve pretty much seen done everything infinitely replayable action rpg like alpha set bedont expect regular updates communication devs youre laughing think theyre going fix kind timely manner doubt theyll want fix dont seem think bad moral story keep passion projects free accept donations whatever start sell obligation customers reviews reflect obligations observed theyve done whatever wanted game without letting customers know thing baited alpha ol switcheroo isnt game paid originally advertised id never paid first place well opinion game may change future however cant recommend game current formula running around gathering special items get gear quests brings dungeons collect artifacts starting againthe aesthetic charming game lacks substance replayability looking buy would recommend waiting month developer address issues game currently fortunately theyve updating regularly opinion game complicated dont get wrong really love game cute art amazing programing skills lot game goes sale would buy worth played game friend believe better play friend wish content exploring lands dev youre reading love homo could add content make exiting thank youpuma original review game hopes would actually continually supported wollay seems gone mia whether working major

play game anymore sadly levelup system first release game years ago really nice feature got feeling progression dont get game state add levelup system reset progress upon entering biomes id play single update months atleast could bring mods update show still care game community good game kinda sucks anything remotely like alpha released years ago game took massive step backwards anywhere near good alpha legitimately somehow went backwards pirate alpha better bad everybody says still downgrade alpha appreciate mechanics like pet armor quest system hope get expanded however think become better game levels skills dungeons mechanics alpha overall experience playing started rough soon got hang really fun running around region exploring different areas fun wished lots work needs done game perhaps bring back old systems mechanics make fun good alpha bad people make hope gets better tho good alpha imo sad years good would hope still fun time friends bad best spend lot time feel like nothing big fan u basically get nothing getting artifacts everytime u go new zone like starting scratch gets really really repetetive feel progression even close original game however large community behind game began modding add back progression system overall great game long download mod fix little everyone better friends best friends mod gets rid region locked gear changes features could good much loved game many oneway communication dev hellbent vision degree turn previous version people left years disappeared caused sort fail shame funny didnt laughgive actual game please going say much like better alpha good enough yet justify purchase good yetalpha feels ploshied versionthe region locked gear makes progressing realy slow pain fullyou need fully explore region gain gear wich used somewere else regions furtherthe big rewards artefacts joke per region level character skill tree levels removed since aplha buildthese atrifacts boring give bonus speed boat gliding speed lantern rangeand little values less month later still broken state impressed game bought six years ago gone cant comprehend whats done time tell game becomes whole region locking equipment boggles mind skills levels hope return former glory regions seem reskins previous time cant recommend game like alpha huge waste time money game walking sim like alpha still funmods make better like old game unfortunately like much content questionable decisions gear works travelling new biome makes gear worthless farm new gear new biome makes efforts worthless implement leveling back game farming pretty tiring especially want craft higherlevel gear requires long grind hrs max lvl breastplate get resources need really underwhelming rewards finishing bossdungeon biome ie radius lamp gets tiny bit bigger breathe bit longer underwater fun first hours arriving point undergeared quest grind materials better equipment really takes flow game wouldnt buy much fun typical type game played amazed much game fun recommend anyone wow played long already im hooked glad came steam hopefully see good development soon really much reviewer goes similar players alpha player changes game quitedisappointing lot things loved game gone skill trees leveling castle design map showed places youve exploration theres lot could talk everyone else pointed far greater detail anything im hoping wollay sees wake call ignored everyone warned releasing beta full version never talked community anything wants improve become better game dev needs learn take criticism communicate community also tutorialguide would nice one doesnt require go look online really sure went wrong used great game recommended currently game turned roguelite pretty bad one thati lot fun game bought back alpha solid rpgexploration foundation couldve built upon past years recommended buy unless sit underneath rainbow kettle filled goldtldr lots potential lightyears away finished lacks new content discover repetitive updates empty promises objectively seen game offers nice graphics like style gameplay choose preferred fighting class customisation options character head straight game understanding mechanics easy fighting requires patience world huge offers variety biomes region goals achieve basically keeps repeating real storyline could tell multiplayer nice addition however seemed fairly wonky dialogues repetitivebut development dilemma many years back game came alpha stage people hyped extremely time updates progress whatsoever anymore game dead years dev returned twitter lots new info features full version release date since post release steam sep one single update even information dev vanished againi sad cant recommend game wish told going sure happened game really isnt fun compared alpha version direction hoped felt alpha much better wow giving hours see much actually pains play game bought back game completely redesigned things loved game player progression levels meaningful exploration skills fair mobs fair zonesthe game longer character progression theres levels theres longer xp fighting mobs hopefully loot drop pointless force explore zone whenever enter new zone gear youve worked hard either killing mobs crafting becomes locked reenter zone skills gone mobs insanely poorly scaled entire zone supposed represent low high leveling zone since game procedurally generated pass zone literally everything could one shot order get closest townfor fault old game sat without update whole years times game become today launch onto steam without infinite leveling skills meaningful mob encounters ability meaningfully explore without feeling like youve kicked teeth every time cross white zone boundaryi really loved game got first update years im left caring game bought many years ago like itfar perfect pretty great nonetheless game anticipated expected lot potential doesnt reachthe beginning quite hard difficulty overwhelming get fun play though also doesnt last longso early game end game arent fun time inbetween fun alpha could said minecraft years still fun deserve hate got remember amount nostalgia repair irreparable ill keep wish list things chance follow mean time good moment design appears pull different directions different alpha amount things fairly low repetitive hoping improves cant recommend expected expect weird minecraft knockoff pleasantly surprised see something wholly original incorporating rpg elements well adventure blocky world colossal world explore hard properly enjoy game first start find one item become breeze usually shy away games mixed results honest really deserves positive reviews isnt bad game sense really dont see gets much hate expected like hoped game biggest waste time ive played wow yearsill add context later time used still kind good weve promised years agoi wish meme unironically bootleg minecraft mods play better mechanics someone actually thought regionbiome locked gear dumbest thing ive ever experienced game thats reason wont let start steam online restart offline mode launch game otherwise cw crashes right depression etci get needed time deal personal life development hard etc etc honestly consumer disappointed years ago ran away money like iirc still multiply thousands people bought alpha years receive nice got steam keys bought alpha state game quite awful worth worth worth worth years worth game play people friends steam mostly walking simulator rather much exploration progression plus wolly already stopped patching posting twitter daily release top deleted apology blogspot lol worth beta testing years worth full price theres guidance new player worth current state worth get told otherwise worth worth money expect updates got game worth worth year wait worth money right worth money alpha better worth money repetitive grinding low rewards want money fixed know alpha tweets woley looks way betterleveling pointless cant tell hype wollay resurfaced baffles see much work discarded worth money game trash year wait bust changes make game bad would get money back could hopefully sells one else make less butt worth time least version anyways try alpha download internet look mins find enjoy enough maybe consider buying version isnt piracy though worth wait least still alpha installed worth wait worth wait want good version cube world seek copy alpha unfinished game ten times better finished game doesnt help devs dissapeared removing blogs tweets trace ever returning clean mess madei dont want dislike game ive following years isnt cube world people wanted worth money unless serious improvement works worth time money would rather add another hours alpha playing another minute downgrade yet warning completely different game compared alphathe quest lore really nice make world feel realfor im missing longterm goal goal game right seems completing whole region find artifact makes one abilities bit better swimming riding gliding start useless gear new zone repeat process starting new region tough since dont glider boat etc yetbeing able swim bit faster isnt enough progression really amazing goal end gameso game potential thoughill update review changes anything significantafter releasing game officially developpers havent shown sign life notei alpha player review specifically game stands currently comparison alpha currently hours game say enjoyed time experiencing game offer several problems game granted time well spentso gameplay get thrown right tutorial explanation levelling system nothing quests nothing villages bosses anything go explore learn everything approach first objective find village people along way literally talk everyone wouldnt attack exaggeration everyone didnt would probably miss something important could hidden areas items bosses yea talk everyone theres indication may tell gotta suck painful dialogalong way advise killing weak things weak arent class rip sir even probably rip still may drop leftovers items thatll use thats bonus may even drop types food use get pets attack ride later find reins fun thati also advise getting many shrines along way arent forced walk way againso talk people may tell go find things may tell areas attack find gnome needs saving cool ay yeah chances youve talked many people found little bother next thing youd want find something thatll allow easier travel youve found someone tells glider boat andor reins great well bad buddy maybe ya got things maybe dont probably latter time miniquests people probably gave theyre high challenge level youll go exploring check map find areas look like house enemies hopefully within range first trying go whiteone star areas easiest completing allow easier progression along explorations take low levelled mobs hope equipment lets say youve followed intended progression talked many people within map youve got great equipment ready face biggest dungeon get artifact everyone telling exciting right permanent perk help future journeys awesome boost yeah okyou blast way right end maybe theres chest end castle perhaps go open amazing found found erdiving staminaamazingyea okso youve got brilliant perk thatll help future endeavours awesome time grind keep boosting statsnext biomeeverything inventory disappears boat using travel biome gone youre middle ocean currently equipped items useless within area yikeshave fun amazing seriousnessthe perks game utter garbage course losing boat glider reins suck anything feeling able completely grind biomes constantly always sort goal throughout game actually great fun enjoy constantly able repeat enjoyed within game progression exploration boss battles awesome things actually advise game isunlocking way allow special items constantly available throughout gamebetter artifects current ones feel worthless incredibly disappointing biome complete lot build grinding something bad ruins moment finishing biome nothing say hasnt already said million times better ways could used rough gem lot potential instead ground dust snorted rip cube world nothing like used back dev ghosted everyone dont waste money nothing like wollay changed main mechanics game beyond would followed original development road map would fallen love great game second time unfortunatethat said hope people enjoying new update dont like doesnt mean wont nothing like alpha barebones alpha hey like exploring thats decent sightseeingwalking simulator nothing like original promised years ago loot changes every different biome enter youve never played may enjoy one played alpha playing nothing like promised product dont get wrong really like game way play start upon entering new region simply avoid enemies unless want tank water mage yes thats right tankiest class healer areas really cool new dungeons special items fast travel others really make enjoyable bad begins upon starting adventure entering new region enemies difficulty static never change throughout game speaking levels experience longer thing anymore power armor weapons feels like makes game lot less free must progress direction game makes honestly bought alpha play instead many others included find enjoyable game boring beginner cube world frustrating mobs atacks game dont tutorial played friends wasnt interesting dont buy game want play wait udpates lot people still upset whole region locked gear thing honestly love game ive played solo far im playing scout game truly amazing applaud devs coming far cant wait play friends kind like region locked gear allows focus exploration rather becoming op anyways obviously opinion honestly recommend getting really great game ive read couple reviews seems biased expectations game turned starting alpha backhowever nature games developer progress coming along slowly obviously leaves game negative reviewswith review attempt biased although played alot alphacube world open world rpg current nature simplisticit gets repetetive fairly quickly might yield players hours worth play time game play alpha maybe morethe game fully explored much time invested imagine people getting bored point endgame stagehowever things badcube world excels ability casually play without friends moments notice able go run cube world much like roguelike games even varying groups friendsto seemed like game cool similar stardew valley action packed rpgit delivered different sense adventure refreshing changea change much enjoyedtldrgiven time taken release really room disappointmenthowever taken face value game still pretty great ok first things firsti havent played alpha beta pure first impression gameprosbeautiful world diffrent kind player models npcs enemys petsrideables faster movementeasy use mapintresting classes diffrent weapons abilitysdiffrent biomeshuge worldnice combat mechanicsconsno leveling would fit well gamerng drops often shows much game dislikes youoften arent regions game filled stuff like one dungeon

regions without weapon upgradeweapon upgrades general region system uselesscrafting isnt fun takes way long simple things thing like iron wood raresence crafting region lock generalocean regions without boat need find new one another regioni really want like game friends somewhat playable none less frustrating ok listen believe cube world good game many review people would say reason people hating game dont understand concept gamea game like shouldnt hated release believe game lot potentiali feel like game people enjoy relaxing game play hard work game great gameplay game love ok gonna lie first night played game actually made feel like playing game havent games fucken boring cannot even fathom bruhvnik game much fun experiencing like night launch playing friends thats fun friends isnt bad thing game good friends game something revolutionary realised next day whole region locking stuff still game great worth try like grinding messing around flying around eagles whatnot opinion region locking changed used alpha whatever played alpha people said good reckon game worth mindless fun friends nevertheless missed opportunity left lot original fans disappointed greatly hope developer man person tries fix tad even though going whatever issues stuff understand really actually enjoy game alot hopefully get enough attention developer improve us gamers may continue gaming okay rewriting found fixsee games configs sometimes need reset glaring bug aside game great border thing sucks allows lot replayability friends adventuring different regionsi love gameplay seamlessly joins friends world tooi wish item upgrade system allowed actual customization maybe future update could allow building gear somethingif wish find fix make sure time posting set recent reddit postpicroma never got back though hurts games rating still eyes oh cube world always believed youd come like theres nothing say already hasnt said still hope one day game said youd years ago however day isnt today suppose well waiting another years least might time spotlight good night sweet prince oh cube world remember game first alpha played hours friends honestly one favorite games time period alpha far better whatever xp system gone fight every enemy come across never get stronger level finding artifacts frustrating find dont even really help adorable game frustrating shell inferior version alpha came many years ago want good cube world game see get alpha honestly disapointment probably isnt worth money oh god stay away fixed game best left alpha progression every enemy overpowered get lucky drop world static bombs nothing crafting shoehorned worthless zones dont reward crafting resources nonexistent game loading issues physically hurts playif reason play go ocean biome chance oh boy cube world quite rollercoaster let explain whyyou start creating character far good soon spawn notice pretty quickly almost everything kills fast instantly unless find stray cow health potions tough ride like first couple hours assure enoying kiting chicken minutes doesnt kill mebut luckily also representative game actually offer get gear get quests find village quite smooth sailing actually start kill stuff without dying every two mobs combat starts become dare say fun wollay pixxie put quite lot content game zone progression feels really fun rewardingonce get good enough gear around purple yellow start endgame content zone comes form multiple larger dungeons get increasingly difficult go end usually rewarded called artifact pickup increases level though stats gives minor bonus something like swimming climbing speed dungeons quite fun artifacts get quite worthless aside bragging rights wollay decides change something useful definitly see becoming quite enjoyable endgameafter complete zone gameplay loop begins since gear carry new zone isnt bad play bit imoall cube world definitely fun game albeit somewhat lacking aspects namely early game progression form artifacts issues something hard change believe refinements game truly become gem people making alphato finish tips early game becomes easier form tutorial game find village asap looking brownish collections rectangles world map weapons armor vendor pretty much every village stock basic gear attack white mobs npcs help also attempt stronger ones white quests award gear class actually start become stronger oh boy game start remember six years ago alpha came excited get hands get chance around week ago get notification wollay twitter saying cube world would released couldnt believe eyes game came instantly wanted buy however waited good week reviews start coming surprise majority new reviews negative read reviews said thing game boring completely different originally point pretty worried state game reading reviews watching videos gamei bought cube world today instantly realized people negative towards game game one word boring combat terrible unless fighting something star rarity dont either die get really close dying world feels empty stale time want better gear need pray rng gods even get drop first place even might get something cant even use progression stale gets boring fast essentially consists running around region quests strong enough gear take last dungeon complete said dungeon get relic gives small mean small bonus mostly mobility stats fact pour much time completing region small boost mobility stats honestly absurd concept grind satisfying rewarding fun cube worlds grind none things besides whole region locking relic concept leveling system another big issue overall think game specific audience enjoy playing cube world think means try right recommend game anyone looking fun engaging adventure game didnt pour much time shadow cube world used everyone else legitimately could barely play hour oh boy time changed design game drastically billed game possible centralized servers localized servers friends join adventure play harmoniously dungeonexplorationlooter type game instead well somethingi got game day launched wayyyyy back day loved alpha challenging much fun group feels like island measure success removed crossing invisible line oh well guess didnt waste bucks least oh good lord guys back got game first came circa later dropped face earth favor dont waste time oh wish review know really love concept game much room grow game good shines incredibly fails fails hard really drags rest experience region locked armor okay shouldnt become useless maybe region locked equipment atrocious makes ocean biomes feel awful theyre boring empty nothing unique except lots empty water monsters like used combat fun taking skill tree made made game unique fun less rewarding linear hope allows us keep reins regions eventually exploring isnt fun rewarding anymore chore great ideas held back extreme manner way make getting reinssailboats fun make give stat bonuses anything crippling movement game movement limited please listen game could incredible theres much listen community believe old system flawed ideas fix failed executing improve make wanted also really hope plan adding new classesraces addition sprucing biomes old cube world felt open boss fights felt much grand overall think good game maybe right improvements patches make enjoyable unique experience change doesnt happen shift review abandon hope dont think caseedit dev abandoned game doesnt speak fans trash game please buy oh man cube world hell years months game enjoying hearing months word devs remained hopefulmonths assuming devs ran moneydev posts random twitter update years nothing people hype others skeptical smartyears go dev posts randomly changes acts like nothing happenedsome guy gets email response dev ignorantly faithful fans act like second coming hate anyone says otherwise blindly praising devsyears later game comes alpha buyers play game question content isignorant fanbase defends devs lives anyone criticizes game mean devsdays go ignorant fanbase finally gets buy gametone immediately changes see criticism called forhere todayleveling removed progression removed exploring removed fun removed gear essentially removed cant taken regions without significant nerfing synthetically add progression game much like slap face cant even bring boat ocean found different region tooltips abilities information use skillsnot mention things talked website back day things tweeted none fully implemented things barebones basic forms ideastldr game hyped much devs ran money come back years later act like nothing happened promise game give concept oh man start loved game released bought soon available loved alpha disappointed game abandoned back years whats changed well quite lot actually random map generation seeds gone presumably stop people sharing seeds like known locations gearbosses xp system gone traditional leveling system many skills also skill tree since xp system removed really isnt reason kill monstersmobs come across drop rate gear depressingly low longer award xp quickly became clear better run away themthe system replaces inherently bad shifts focus game become roguelike rpg fine thats wollay going problem new system fully developed completely fine want strip away players weaponsgear zones lasting progression somewhereright artifact system scratch spend time clearing zone artifact award swimming speed useless stat increase items stripped leaving zone start scratch next zone essentially wasted time make current system worth losing old one artifacts would need serious overhaul grant significant useful buffs whether useful stat increases unique skillsi cant recommend game grossly overpriced whats developer doesnt best track record reliability communication oh year since game officially released naive purchased game alpha years ago thinking would turn something like minecraft seeing abandoned past first alpha instantly made realize game would never exist supposed marketed dev blames anxiety sharp lash back alpha perfectionist game never got regular updates reality dont think ever made extensive plan work instead opted work complete vacuum without outside input instead became like gigantic cash grab aimed gamers looking next big open world procedural generated adventure gamei tried cube world released steam get final opinion changes made alpha utterly terrible cant find reason call game fun even worth purchasing release built poorly thought design changes nothing changed better end honestly alpha content progression final release game wolfram von funck list worst indie game developers right along side yandere dev game summed vaporware point dont see ever improved upon significant way future avoid costs ok honestly like game yes doesnt compare old game charm game still hope possibly play old version opinion fun game ok backed game first announced played lot heard coming back hyped hell think game took wrong steps went backwards skill tree alpha gone reason levels less gone outside artifacts give level mention artifacts kind useless dont anything great buff fast travel world even big deal reallyyou lose gear go across line unless gear star gear dosent also lose glider tools like bother leaving one area lose stuff start makes real sense point view know one point view makes try new items yea yea better way want make happen like shouldnt lose gear cross line get back got back line thats kind stupid punishes exploration dont know old alpha different system spawn one point got spawn harder enemies got better stuff dropped way better system far ok ive played many many hours alpha cw game steam waited years opinion wollay misunderstood time game godly thoughtful mean real locking system isnt bad need loot items want rush game explore etc talk fly master left click wherever want go youre done complete region collect artefact take arround time took alpha walk onei think system perfect want play someone new start biome come back one later easy cost nothing youve unlocked teleport status honnest leveling good feel progression peapols played cant talk artefact obtain lvl artefacts faster friends complete region easily moreover quests incredibly cool never mobs etc arena done time per day allow better gears time took explore whole biome alpha compensated fly master free teleportation friends teleportation status ocean find boat first land walk etc thougt nearly everything dont even want talk dongeon randomly generated like everything loots quests map region weapons artefactsto conclude game nearly perfect honest would like keep mount region would like little quests like kill ghost get gold idk whatput back spell bar really cool alpha worst cant put spirit wings shoulder really sad buy game dont listen everyone even need play proper opinion play dont like ask refund like case write comment steam tell think gamethanks wollay love ok game pretty good like minutes bad nothing developer disapeared return years steal money still hope leftat least game colorful ok second region lol ok right game completely unplayable wont work anything windowed mode spend minutes trying get ui screen right size impossible windowed mode causes ui disappear behind border game running slow rig tried every fix found internet none worked hopefully much work one day playable im glad didnt buy ok heres real review people want factual recommendation game thoughts crazilybiased temper tantrumso start cube good game opinioncube world open rpg game pick classes yata yata yata youre really good stuffso yes zone lock yes lose regular gear go another zone h w e v e r craft gear admittedly take lot time use zones away zones take hours complete making gear good around hours playtime ive waiting game years along lot people im disappointed yeah sure artefacts bit useless people dont seem understand cube world longterm game dont want users get max gear hours get bored game like kind mans land games cube world tries make playerbase excited brand new randomly generated quests every zone side note playing like hours special items like gliders spikes etc zone locking isnt really timeconsuming im trying force like want clear shit since kids like raging poor little level system gone precious skill tree taken away even though made game better dont like dont play need ass ok wait minute everyone need chill understand guys upset gear locking added ways get around gear locking plus artifacts supposed go understand guys upset heard stuff first played beta tester agree game good game need bit work far think worth wait okay listen goes years ago man pressured releasing alpha wasnt ready amazing years work depression sadness almost giving released project people hate people love love whyin alpha four classes levels played shit got gear class easy mode lets explore cube world beta first thing gonna notice weird progression system levels gone gear based however lose non gear moving new zone lot people hate think keeps game fresh im explore instead becoming powered restart move new zone explore new area get gear small advantage start yea miss skill tree levels reality alpha could get maxed skill tree hourthe classes fun ive played degree personal favorite water mage heals thats powered also assassin rogue game play solid game runs greatso orginal cube world player beta tester man always wanted something like recommend game love explore dont mind exploring basically rpg rogue like instead dying restarting restart mostly next would wait years okay first things first amazing game best advice give ignore negative reviews grumpy cause game isnt exact game played years ago new features feel fresh new loads fun play multiplayer need stop thinking rpg rougelite okay reviewed game minutes playtime currently hoursthis probably serious review ever writeas extremely excited game come alpha goodi really want like game ive waited years update remember years old playing alpha friends skype lot fun game cube world years ago better think leveling system game really good concept possibly best one ive ever seen spawn region im pretty sure always spawn near city go city talk bunch npcs occasionally give tips mark items bosses maponce get good gear armor youre finally strong enough go dungeon dungeons possible find artifact artifacts increase level would best leveling system game ive ever played increased actual useful stats probably biggest downside game region locking every single thing get region locked except artifacts would given game positive review would way increase damage permanently maybe regions like times bigger theres point continuing play game weapons armor become useless quickly dont get emotionally attached items remember id always rename tools minecraft made feel personal always really sad whenever id lose pickaxe bow whatever game wont hesitate sell bow ive playing game mods fix region lock havent tried yetive bit fun game near enough amount fun back alpha dayswollay believe fix game okay first give game chance alpha owner got participate closed beta agree silly mechanics regionlocked items still find enjoyable im sure time goes one favorite multiplayer games friends team coordination help games difficulty im playing solo water mage dont every find hard nothing could done better yes agree balance isnt impossible promotes team play ive waited years game get im happy cause better nothing okay lets face alpha sure way better developers trying still fun game dont get wrong still reccomend players arent like whole review section protesting bring back features alpha shouldnt abandon game thats right yeah happy exists couldnt even play alpha okay lets try ive forcing keep playing started thinking maybe reason dont like game different sure isnt well flushed game made one person know get getbad things starting probably hardest thing looking materials craft base gear survive hard running monsters high level finding lot materials crafting seems spread make something requires workbench saw loom furnace campfire etc seems pointless things one item craft sure plan add things future feel able craft everything one would better considering limited amount things craft aswell craftable thing seen interacting said thing else stuck looking bottom corner see made also percentage complete region isgood thingsas said starting game hard ball starts rolling keeps going starts getting bigger knew hopping stars stars weapon armor rating another thing feel saturated games babying us everything mean telling us go mind dont know much game worked discovering things learning things well kinda felt started play minecraft first time knowing nothing learning went npcs great help learning things sure always look found figuring much rewarding cant tell silly feel take every type tamable items see thats want id say come game open minded might enjoy attempt something differentoverall alright game id say give try money okay every said clearly perspective information acquired game game made man wife even attacked online ddosing possible things heard lead believe rather game players project wolfram von funck wife sarah von funck tell story create experience world created possible something else basically form world building thought make think game niche following personally like directions wolfram gone helps sell sense exploration idea treading would unknown arent even part world hope wolfram wife take everything community says including pinch salt hope cube world becomes game happy hope dont put risk trying please people said still good critical remember try distinguish subjective dissatisfaction objective one small summary general thoughts lets get beefy part review tips playing game endokay im going try explain believe main component game use comparison going thoughts new leveling system personally think benefits component im going use dark souls specifically first one maybe majoras mask botw game share something handle exploration certain degree use idea world building create experience mean gain direction purpose npcs curiosity explore world similarities end mind cube world dark souls two side coin dark souls like climbing mountain journey like trial idea climbing mountain climb mountain sites going bonus dark souls like mind driving force end part defeat boss reach end cube world opposite side coin dark souls joy game come execution exploration way journey feels play breaths life world created may play new regions systems give little bit mental stimulus actively want complete much possible region also giving new challenge move next region region complete starting progress become easier easier best way explain fun time spent scouring map thing looked interest well talk every npc felt wonderful play playing game quickly learnt importance prepared use every thing power gain advantage make journey easier play game feels less like playing game beat boss complete much regions possible feels like encapsulation experience exploring world unknown chucked clue go make decision based info collect locals new world feel like really amazing book draws create thoughts stories part world book drawn cube world feels leans towards tool wolfram wife build world tell story kind enough let us join ride us region lock system makes sense mind tool maybe even accidental makes appreciate world two people poured heart soul intothat said still interactive experience make beginning steps learn interact game easier grasp lack knowledge tools cause great experience fall horrible one feel one greatest flaw cube world lack means learn tools controls case even controls uses f keys learn characters ability might resize map list controls someone searching something find game twitter post creator might sound like cant real people dont use social media heck barley touch facebook even though account life twitter wolframs wifes tweets im massive fan cube world cube world didnt exist would taken much longer use twitter maybe wouldnt use tools learn game found within game thing game made two people tested two people course wouldnt think adding certain thing doesnt come mind look something already know conclusion hope streamline learning process controls maybe even making key bindings fully customizable would greatly help learning interact world built enjoyable rather struggle find tweet mentions certain button maybe hint npc games title screen like npcs normarly something important say would add loti hope continue create game proud im ready sit sidelines enjoys stuff create okay think obvious biased review obvious love game new leveling system may perfect much refreshing old system much prefer thing game see passion project something worked spare time might wrong feels something poured hearts still live daily lives possibly working another job okay way everything logs mushrooms roots heart flowers etc need carry everything afraid use eagle going new areas always prepared enough recourse buy craft next basic weapon possible even rely npcs yes help full look map go ration scale use view map places interest okaythe game isnt bad got lot better alpha noticeable better quests better look animals better combat items artifacts etc god region lockat beggining wasnt worried mean could grow power sounded cool concept soon tried changing lands since ive trouble find artifacts specials checking last stuff remaining noticed wasnt small downgrade like oh yellow legendary gear uh green wharever think wasnt even white gear suredont misunderstand game good worth wait would buy could think downgrade region lock much tm missing stuff like tameable cows fixing pathfinding monsters principally flying onesin alpha progressed slowly could keep done went legendary like days hours cant keep progress insteadrecommended grinders specially old game better soooooooo trash merits cube world fairly flawed game however enjoyed current format say however price far high amount content game still early access title support garenteed add content id say might worth watch content incredibly lackingwait see game improves buying wait see support continued wait sale maybe bucks itll worth playing right however positivei rarely enoucntered bugsupgrading weapons allows make look uniqueits really complicated builtit works smooth little demandon negative sideit lacks form explanation tutorial figure even basic thingsbalance place npc players imo classes good subclass bad onetotal region lock sucks youre done region almost entire gear becomed useless onmy lucky items might foundoutside progress region progress level finding artifacts real impact levels matter artifacts give minor upgrade stuff like latern range swimming speedit smells bit like abadonware compatibility windows supported know many people choose windows familar fixed would recomend itthe game experience self amazing sucks go way pc bank pay per hour play cube world beautiful beginnings game oh tragedy occurred one day remembered game searched found going get released got hyped playing new release felt huge disappointment amazing game turned trash still updates release hope fix somehow im still hopeful one giant problem progressing zone actually pretty fun knowing playtime lose worth going different zone disheartening game needs kind long term progression artifactsystem hardly meaningful mei played hundreds hours alpha gameplay fun felt rewarded every gear level upgrade game lots potential future one best games ive ever played one best rpg played far one biggest hypeblueballing cases ive ever seen im probably saying every negative review gonna say extreme disappointment years eager undying loyalty zealous fan base understand developer struggled depression life family job etc spend years posting updates game making progress towards games stretch goals would hope see least newly released version feels like someone else took reigns designed game light barely original planned features especially highly coveted xp advanced skill tree systemsas game feels like big chore simulator rpg spend hours completing continent unfulfilling noncombat stat boost reward go another continent lose equipment thing theres motivation explore continue especially find highest quality weaponsarmor lying ground five minutes zone would expect finding stuff many hours would satisfying good payoff work alpha didnt ton content either actually felt like adventure could play many hours look back see much progress youve made traveling far leveling etci hope game eventually becomes originally meant instead embarrassment guess thats developer decides communicate community fade away ill gladly change review ever happens hopes arent high fun multiplayer gets pretty boring restarting progression zone fun mods shell former self beautiful concept likely never see light day ever rest peace cube world short fun restart anew every country opinions subjective opinion piece let stop enjoying game different thoughtsim frustrated game turned im disappointedi bought alpha game way back years ago friend mine told blast play time infinite leveling skill points really added fun though balanced gameplay experience time decent bit planned content wollay developer laid website excited games futureradio silence became common theme wollays development small bits pieces would thrown way every months never updates time hear finally happeningso get timewe got artifacts give lackluster boosts ive ever seen range glider speed around lamp radius boost things youre supposed exploring tell sounds appealling none combat related theyre exploration based weak buffs thatwe got xp skills reworked entirely levels artifact locked power comes entirely gear xp entirely removed instead kill random mobs small sums gold chance getting item color difficulty skill points also removed hell cant even read skills game new help button tells keybindings name skillwe got region locked gear cant go another region keep power unless gear giving power go new area fun gameplay mechanic none rewards fun engaging give power go new region weak artifacts new biomethe map generation weaker alpha quite honest exploring felt like chore anything else go talk npcs get quests location info isnt easy way filter new information kinda spam talk everyone see hope dont comment liking name top best way find respawn shrines look map zoom glaze eyes entire region hardly fun way playlastly want mention planned content told would new classes skill trees main stories cities fair bit back alpha released much currently build none mentioned im aware development changes time wollay hasnt addressed concern lack also hasnt really touched questions surrounding changes core game doesnt respond points dont support decision toa lot issues subjective decent bit people enjoy game applaud enjoying game youre one people gave shot couldntthere minor details take issue already said hasnt made case wouldnt change anything eitherto concludei bought alpha enjoyed would buy game stands today original review hrs gameplay thumbs downunpolished rpg becomes polished walkingsim lack persistent loot lack questing direction lack skill leveling somehow feels alpha alpha truly mystifying game developmentedited review hrs gameplay thumbs felt need give another shot expectations playing way game seems want played honestly feel bad giving thumbs originally true game absolutely alpha cannot play like played alpha cannot enjoy like may enjoyed alpha transformed entirely early complaints eventually rectified discovered new albeit sometimes hidden qualityoflife features additions alltogether extremely improved game lack persistent lootwhile initially feels like youve robbed goodies enter new region think ultimately compelling balance feature lets get much region forces explore really adventure properly new area cakewalking across world dressed nines legendaries go find new legendaries lack questing directionthis easytalk people theyll give direction could want use shrines tp nearest landmark dive parts map havent yet explored lack skill levelingleveling occur slow wont give perk points spend system completely revamped gear primary source strengthening abilities found map likely first quests locals give youthis game pretty tech demo overall highly recommend alpha patrons must understand alpha better originally created around cube world special place heart oldschool kind rpg handholding tutorial massive world get dropped figure rest really though need wiki con among ones tutorial game little sparse content well major overarching plot complete zones basically restart zero every time enter new zone unless find weapons tend pretty damn rare ive personally sank many hours game steam completing zones also isnt incredibly rewarding since artefacts level give real stat bonuseswhat game going personality styling two peoples creative vision shows gameplay although repetitive enjoyable world absolutely gorgeous day ceased amaze doubly randomly generated recommend personally wait diamond dug dirt polished gem truly unlike many reviewers seemsif want complete finished game play find flaws move however want see trove likes would like actually good originally reviewed game positively last year week stopped playing sat inventory collecting dust like fair enough personally could refund probably would people already done good job explaining happened whats wrong recommended current state hours far good reason people giving negative reviews dont like game different alpha however never played alpha look game instead used say right game fun enjoy new progression system little caveat artifacts game stat items persist throughout regions give movement boosts even still good hours theres mods let artifacts boost combat stats give real progression well mods add xp system back game mind definitely worth money overall fun game problems overall improvement alpha build available since many reviews failed mention quite questionnable game design choices mainly resetting gear stats every time go new area overall game tries succeeds providing series fun adventures similar yet varied enough environments smidge metroidvaniaas improvements mainly hope better way provide new challenges found resetting gear stats previously mentionned maybe quests get varied multiple steps lore intensive quests shown dev blog posts actually implementedtldr unfairly criticized great start needs followed overall enjoy game missing lot even release biggest thing riding pets leveling unless consider picking new gear leveling far tell doesnt exactly work towns found everything petrified look forward seeing game grow develop hard say gamedefinitely fun run around friends though psa dev ran away blog deleted steam moderators pushing mods fix game modding isnt even supported pretty iffythe uglywindows doesnt work dont buy windows play anymore audio engine changed doesnt support windows crash desktop launch critical issue moved topthe devs went dark years stripped features already game shown features never made game progression consists farm get pointless artifact level get gear farmed stripped level counter many artifacts effectively pointless uninteresting game suffers usual issues procedural generated worlds everything feels first time found game used moddable quite easily code obfuscated databases stored binary data opposed normal database like used specifically changed way serves make modding game harder badthe game properly screenshot something like puush engine doesnt like gives screenshot last time tabbed spins camera wildly meaning cant even game systemtabbing makes game go fake window mode minimized takes full monitor one monitor cant tab borderless fullscreen mode fix itskill trees got removed spawn skills changed better used hours spawned making stronger lower cooldown like beforethe level system counter many flashlight distance upgrades joking tabbing switching fake window means even users several monitors instead instant like takes several seconds waiting tab back insome features kept game useless ridiculously grind heavy like crafting bad gear taken hour gameplay costs less go buy better gear trader reason craft anything six ten times expensive requires go hunt materials tens hours one item time worse gear could bought instantlymages terrifyingly overpowered hitscan enemies perfect aimbot accuracy using damaging weapons game need abuse ai stunlocks multiple people working together usually healing mage take one game scale multiplayer harder game mounts form pets boats hang gliders however every new area must go find purpose giving player faster travel speed speed dull movement time removing every time progress every two hours infuriatingthe goodon positive game receiving bugfixes content updates changes skills ie quicksand scout part better old skills old skillsthe dungeons cool feel samey first two three go new biome resets gearoverall found cubeworld good hours enjoyment point began convincing team mate go play alpha progression modding dedicated servers almost game gameplay much better progression though overpowered end scales hard says something hours alpha last week beta shiny new beta dont buy wait hopefully get reworked everything far seems done weeks time get money heartbreaking see little effort seems went doesnt even mention rampant moderator abuse steam forums deleting post dared offer solutions fix multitude fundamental gameplay issues lack acknowledgementcomment anything community brings bug reports good ported old alpha pretty easily leaves bad ugly behind release build compelling reason play disheartening opinion stay away stay far away paid alpha way back today game dumpster fire manyurl thingsurl trashed replaced worse counterparts creator stripped away many good ideas implementations left us good engine best wife seemingly fled launch leaving game vary barebones alpha dev promised us good amount content fled second time first time fled took years supposedly depression caused attack may people buying gameurl anyone points sort negative criticism steam forums mods delete act like assholes character progression sucks really bad grind roughly hours items conquer area within another start gear becomes worthless buy game unless wolley comes back fixes paid game back alpha days loved love sure region lock huge problem lot salty alpha players hit nice drop weapon grind almost immediately alpha monsters still hard kill even really good weapon specifically artifact keepers certain dungeons yes game needs little bit love care little bit less harassment haters wollay pixxie keep updates beta see cube world taking like storm like alpha stages even though next updates back thenif youre new player never played seen cube world would recommend game warned get region lock something take lightly leave region without gear need farm another piece basically beginning tediousthe game great feel crafting shops stuff need bit love flight paths death mechanics difficulty perfect right opinion peacefull exploration game interesting new dynamics gameplay focussed stat maxing incredible world generation lot different structures lore people giving game lot flak personally really enjoy update wollay lot new things love would recommend playing game still going places still super enjoyable play enjoy region lock cant grind good gear level murder every single thing game problem whatsoever super glad update release date came used lot fun playing game used get repetitive old systemtldr people saying game isnt good anymore end opinion mine encourage get game play find great still personal opinion however game used amazing still like style genre love game people mad game years ago good game yes different lot fun play friends people also mad aint easy fun people argue years ago progression system became endless grind ultimately pointless agreetoday progression system goes zonebyzone regionlocked equipment go opposite extrem years ago make even bigger grind restartevery single zone scratch devs done years design progression system across zones created enemies fight dungeons crafting resources drop stronger stronger enemies equipment variety moment theres barely difference power level example blue gear every blue gear strong blue gear introduce power rangesthis game falls flat nose currently reason start new zone get hang gliding diving speed buffs whatever thats worth allwhy didnt create dungeons endgame resources gear diversity skill trees skill points endgame bosses etc etc people liked game features removed alpha seems silly make huge changes get rid existing community people play least region reviewing actually enjoying game im playing like crazy lot building lot things region lock made explore instead going dungeon dungeon like alpha thing didnt like artifacts difficulty first region actually hardnow done regions complete finish get game works regions extremely easy artifacts gives bonuses special items find regionlike glider pet boat atleast found yet artifacts gives bonus like damage bonuses like actual makes want search artifacts find everything game im sure gonna grow boring hope gets lots updates keep playing price combat system liked lot people say alpha better wrongpeople say game improved correctthis game really fun gameplay progressiongear based gameplay actually makes lot sense even though know people hate losing progress every new biome maybe couldve rationalised region based lore fair criticism think overshadowing achievements gamewhat comes fun exploring new biomes fighting difficult bosses game relaxing game beautiful worth every cent personally loved game came still greatly enjoy waiting long seeing planned updates site feels though handed different game hoping upgrade cubeworld instead feels weve traveled one alpha another personally good game like new system dungeons little boring adventure starting go dungeon dungeon get better armor weapons personally loved game despite flaws certainly better come developers person team family personally think people mean year interval big alpha release nowcubeworlds pretty fun leveling mechanic isnt youd expect game harsh learning curve still fun exploring world pretty fun especially find points interest middle nowhere exploring worlds lore pretty fun learning various kingdoms regions various tribes areas enjoyablethe one thing wish extremely rare equipment didnt range limit get theres range limit equipment primary form increasing stats game world goes forever overwhelmingly easy youre constantly walking around like godoverall im happy cubeworld still fun way harsher game alpha personally games issues really lot criticism put upon valid lot points people make make sense though someone never really capable playing alpha able fantasize really game first place im locked older view people game feel like negative comments personally come place wanting old cube world back yeah course old game great likely fantastic though someone never expierenced alpha im happy fun doesnt mater month eternity good time know three hours think glitched last night said six reason stopped playing school personlig dont get hate love changes phenomenally well made game extremely confusing first get thrown information direction new player experience could slightly improved game exploration finding farming loot felt extremely fulfilling unlock first item every single one play game get see deliberateness certain mechanics may questioned firstgame extreme potential hope content added like additional weapon types abilities classes etc played hours enjoyed say like slower paced games distant end goal dont like reaching endgame quickly fun drains game move something else spending hours looking legendary magic wand damage current legendary magic wand isnt fun enjoy dropping power ladder new area finding loot climb back boat hang glider leash problem could definitely fix game sorely needs bit content spice things region locking big deal needs lorestoryexplanation maybe game mechanic used bypass region locking youve done enough work really dont like itwas game ready full release though maybe maybe played couple hours beta game absolute wash might played alpha way back honestly idea gutted muchno xp skill progression system possible level infinitely may seem repetitive interesting see far could take character wasnt perfect system made everything trivial gear system great much like actual arpg would play two things could probably addressed make progression little challenging creating difficult content would one beta stripping us gear clearly fun way things skill tree system removed could specialize things like hang gliding making go faster also true boats etc similar artifacts work currently beta butbetter actual choice also skill improvements made character feel bit stronger situationsi dont know game longer fun game isnt something id normally play begin im huge fan arpgs beta longer something id consider rip alphaim probably bias honestly really enjoyed alpha much hits heavy feel probably overly passionate drastic change bottom line played alpha probably going enjoy beta played back alpha years kinda excited see finally see full release find things enjoyed removed game seen little progress years mind boggling played alpha enjoyed skill progression system feeling working towards making powerful game state feels overly grindy rewarding region locking fine ways lack skill progression real turn plan playing bit time dont think worth hopefully wollay starts actually communicating us played alpha received beta version free steam game fantastic premise beautiful aesthetic current state cannot recommend basic mobility tools regionlocked long term progression game hours gameplay making small boosts stats like boating speed acquired made feel like id achieved nothing game feels emptier barebones alpha many teased features scrapped six years development community feedback addressed developer expect additional changes game future cube world beta nostalgic fun hours especially friends believe worth full price tag played hours full different regions got super unmotivated bored try progress artefacts daily patches none recently seems like nothing changed added almost coins buying anything seems pointlesssure could odd buildings content havent used progression isnt best pick theres big update played alpha little loved bought despite reddit steam said honestly really bummed current state game appeared online thought id play bit someone modded game made like alphawell dollars spent game already racked hours days playing thats pretty unusual actually really enjoying find even remotely bothered region lock system solid hours per region multiplayer works extremely well google get friends join game probably absolutely think game worth dollars cube world worth wait give shot played alpha excited final product wanna go back played ago shitty laptop im grown enough play nasa pc still lovin voxel game genre definitely check game worth first hrs played alphawhile many features reworked core gameplay still exploration fighting still feels awesome ton fun adventuring beautiful world voxelswhile many find regionlocking feature annoying unneccessary solves fundamental problem overpowered one point however solves problem created another nothing accomplish region impact power character always progression within region overall point view almost progression thing makes character powerful long run artifacts hidden dangerous places dungeons mostly movement upgrades sometimes dont feel like worth trouble right thing give journey meaningthat said game still blast sure regionlocking bit controversial issue enough reason give game downvoteit still fun ever played hours really give good try dont buy dont level gameplay super simple worst worst get good equipment area go another area equipment loses stats entirely star legendary axe went next area less starter weapon progression thats resetting progress tiny ass area mention way finding village takes way long die much start looks great great potential ya flubbed worth buy played alpha long time ago seriously cant recommend game current state gear regionlocked theres literally real sense progression pretty messy overall xp leveling completely removed left alpha version released six years ago significantly better opiniondev also gone completely silent twitter since release im sure even get updates improve fix hope dont feel like willi buy alpha long time ago get steam copy free nice played alpha nearly decade ago miss exp think artifacts little significant im love new version good game played beta bit guess expert looking old cube world sure hell aint fun anyways dont know refreshing play game overall great fun friends means go buy played alfa quite bit extensively going felt like return nice warm bed didnt yet play much still really fun get feeling back interface feels still bit wonky get used ok nice see game finally finished although wolly probably keep tweaking played alpha loved game playing beta still loving game explore really huge world find quests get better craft really lovely made game much details und always something new explore recommend cube world played alpha ages ran multiple servers years everything loved gone place game loop isnt rewarding region locked gear makes leaving home zone tedious chore losing ability use mount boat glider entering new zone ridiculous clear ocean zone go neighboring one refind boat stuck swimming every want see cube world could look wollays youtube channel watch videos years ago played alpha many years ago full release really expands gameplay provides great co op experience play friends played alpha religiously loved skills progression dev went awol yearscomes back promising changes releases beta okay actual release doesnt like backlash critique changes werent good alpha gameplay goes awol day still hasnt updated communitynot surprised dissapointedif want play play mods played alpha came quite interested see would years ago steam somehow even less playable played alpha much better felt empty anything like played also practically unplayable unless friends definitely worth played game official release loads fun reliving alpha build could use game mechanics like exploring starts getting repetitive im still hopeful game played game hours fun playing friends leveling means nothing progression game artifacts minimal point themthings believe game look giving us road map theyre going look things game going everyone gets idea going happening well keeping touch people played game back alpha loved game love played alpha know certainly similar experience many core combat mechanics without traditional rpg skill tree xp system game focused exploration enjoy games like breath wild youll love cube world lot game world dense challenges quests areas explore progression definitely seems slow first feels great working regions conquering challenges couldnt earlier gameoverall game feels like mix rpg exploration game learning ins outs area youve done everything interests youll get mileage game looking forward whats come played game see progress region lock would ok artefacts would give buffs life skill boosts mean game fun short time friends dont catch rly lags end game content updates hope atm seems like wollay disappeared wouldnt recommend played game minutes spent hanging village spawn next talking towns folks dialogue plain short one gave quest save gnome way side mapi spent minutes time

friends please allows steam workshop game great fun make mods game please aware might get mousepurchase riskedit big shitstormbut seriously would recommend spending current build region locking might topic often addressed id argue important issue hand put simply right game next content combat simplistic curious cubeworld evolved last year go watch gameplay spoiler alert barely might worth checking every months wollay doesnt choose abandon project together heavy backlash please bring back old cube world everyone liked one much better please change good old cube world pleeeeaaaase please change name disappointmentthe creator working years since last patch disappointment worked pretty welli hope hes happy probably hidden message game describes fathers stand towards wollay disappointment able add something new whole years silence please dont commit toaster bath time dev please dont stop updatingi love game butthere plenty things need improved gameeven though game right quit entertaining still could weapons armors special items would great used different regions need instructions certain areas especially areas needs special items hopefully storylines future one villager provide certain tasks missions guide players upgrade get special items players dont talk every villagers passerbys order know bosses please add mission lists upgrade items please add sort tracking map follower quickest route item please add mod status map big bosses like villages animals see mapsee little heads moving map find might stupid think quit confusing sometimes play game already accquired full diamond armors weapons reason im still level one someone explain would great craft essential items like sleeping bags campfires could gather materials craft items would amazing cuz really need easy find map new user guidance teach new users play game properly like button quick play game starts let players attack mods trade something please set different languages players countries finding language pack website shaddy dont really trust please illustrate kinda food used kinda pets cuz collect pet food whenever see cute animals go pet food find ones like absolutely love game however setting game really frustrates player expect great things game really wish game get better please download mod related fixing region lock got friends excellent time killer please keep updating wollay dont like changes still improve plenty people complaining game completely different alpha comprised thats find fun artifacts arent meant give boosts stats gliding speed artifacts make game easier makes replayable fun new region mechanic wollay subverting genre rpg games making twist itand sure maybe spending hours trying find artifact makes swim faster isnt worth feeling completion victory get finally done get explore new land pls give us alpha back upgrade new fetures like ores goblin trader onand yeah like users write want lvl skill system questmarked npcs dungeons gear based area system isnt way motivate people play game long timei belive game great even better pointless trash game walking around oneshoted mobs looting things useless elsewhere garbage even enhance experience crashing twice btw nice rpg without perks stuff retarded idea behind rooting loot particular areas whats damn point looting twat dev positive review bit criticismhonestly good game even besides changes regional system doesnt bother much allows every part world feel like new adventure without make characters game feels bit unfinished though parts found ending wetlands biome second zone one characters zone dungeons didnt work mobs would broken ai attacking running past huge curves instead right towards attacking world would simply simply stop rendering within areagood game could little bit work never know maybe update one dayid still recommend pre good pretty awesome game spend hours enjoying wollay definitely big plans grow game pretty bare bones still even years development even basic skill tree type char progression beyond swim speed lantern light radius would feel like breath fresh air pretty stale unrewarding currently pretty boring hope somehow play alpha purchasemodding support would nice pretty fun took probably fun thing game xp skill trees wont keep playing add pretty fun even years fun friends though pretty fun little bit repetition pretty good game tbh takes get promised still fun great mods though pretty much reasoning everyone elsealpha farfrom perfect beta release even game gives sense progression apart basest useless percentage upgrades gear constantly resetting every zone means entire game feels like youre playing super mario every pipe end takes back start world theres also literally point pets hoping find harness ride speed increase dont level dont get stronger scale properly gear nothing transportation see wollay trying change really wish talked players first could told earlyon absolutely terrible idea avoided whole circusi cannot recommend game current price bucks hours repetitive game play fair trade todays market pretty solid game probably never going actually set complete game dev cant finish make good extensive promises rip highschool self probably one innovative procedurally generated games even little repetative progression based around exploring regions welcome change since alphabefore would spend almost time grinding within small number regions alpha didnt incentive go furtherthe beta release much encourages demands player continue explore find quests meet friends regionsoverall id say good improvement alpha brings unique form progression cube world havent seen many titles streamlines many class abilitiesi cant wait see cube world progresses progression lol progression system screwed grind stuff

like capital cities unsure maybe wait sale keep game wishlist keep eye future updates rip alpha fun rather pirate alpha much better fun read reviews recommended unnecessary repeat contructive criticism want agreei really hope devs announce kind roadmap listen community read reviews agree getting game yet unless changes ofc read reviewsin essence game decided strip fun rpgs midgame dole end game tiny slivers replace fun even early game grind powerlessness isnt even rpg anymore game rpg mechanics proof concept totally works game isnt worth ten dollars let alone twenty free games provide people clearly wanted cube world initially seemed offering theres point playing game unless enjoy idea playing mmorpg deleting character every time reach level five starting new one exact class race im blunt im cruel vendetta personal stake game besides twenty dollars drain unless gets pretty drastic facelift things people enjoyed alpha brought back going small feat programming prowess restructure game much theres genuinely way game worth playing pretty much anybodyedit new information sat game looked peoples opinions realized offer people trying analyze game thats released separate context alpha development time many games cases perfectly reasonable cube world opinionindie games built community support since cant depend publisher large team paid top dollar need support community behind cube world support spades people playing game vocal things liked didnt like setting aside people started defending game concept developed vacuum bad idea understandable given conditions faced dev terms immense online harassment ridicule softer point still contact discord server full people supported religiously one im sure would glad dig game provide feedback barring never let anyone else play fear leaks theres ground stand search cube world alpha yt one years flooded people playing alpha playing multiplayer people loved game know fact played hundreds hours know one youtuber literally still using cube world alpha footage talk earlier year release announced access feedback access seeing people enjoyed maybe thats game wanted make anymore case thats fine dont call cube world dont try use infamous title controversy create buzz hype release make different game dev said scrap restart scratch times didnt wouldnt even loss work case use assets cube world whatever cube world already

ratings shows thats universal fun game game fun certain type person certain people fun peeling potatoes releasing game feels dishonest utmost reeling people already idea game like yearning familiar gameplay mechanics sweet sweet endless arcadelike progression fun chill multiplayer granted broken mobility mechanics tied whole experience together thats people knew thats cube world market thats said delivering stripped things people expecting wanting whole reason game smash hit alpha stages became practically household name presented game product consumer base genre everything im appalled dont believe happened maliciousness takes intense negligence get bad behave way ive heard removing perfectly honest criticism taking blog refuse pretend acceptable behavior really enjoying game quite bit different originally released alpha version polish gameplay loop much improvedmany people probably enjoy region locked gear approach game roguelite action adventure game makes lot sense really cant recommend game current state regionlocked gear progression really takes away original alphas exploration infinite progression theres virtually incentive explore regions one character rolling new characterif changes undone core gameplay loop isnt selfcontained tiny sections map ill gladly change review really dont like direction game went semblance fun removed seemingly reason try different really enjoyed game launch hope features added different game play optionsedit well came back praying something new nope dont waste money really enjoying game worth every penny long updates im grateful see game completed look forward future updates really enjoying new updates makes exploring area feel fresh interesting exploring loot new area fun well makes clearing areas feel rewarding riding sailing hang gliding still really fun well really enjoying masterpiece anyone giving bad review hasnt researched game meant played mates great time great time game really fun could explaining everything really fun game constantly getting updated great friends really good adding mods discord good mod list really good game great graphics although good alpha really good game really fun playing friends open worldanimalsweapons much morebut think price big game really great game spent lot time playing plan spend lot playing coop def way go love region locking honestly great try really high hopes overall dissapointment beta player tried give game fair motivated shot times time would lead less less motivation continue forward also lorestory linenpcs complete joke actual writing made children linear traditional rpg experience cube world could amazing though developer decided wasnt good enough replaced something worse really feels uninspiring play really love played alpha problem alpha world leveled infinitely basically meant always level release fixes issue splitting map regions creates satisfying gameplay loop eventually break little skill strategy people complain region locking dont understand play gamethere classes styles class types weapons different attacks making grand total different play styles mention tweaks make build various statsthe move sets huge making strategies employ defeat enemies large get incredibly skillful way fight way move around landscape way strategically plan journey area area locking brilliant way creating gameplay loop ultimate goal break loop aquiring items work across regions artifacts weaponsarmor end name progression system leave feeling like god become fast powerful feeling able start region quickly progress star gear compounds feeling powerabsolutely brilliant game would love see updates future perhaps ones create economies property game looking forward many playthroughs really lovely game thanks wollay cool really nice game currently unplayble due lowest fps ive ever seenplease devs work performance really nice gamesome flaws system searching better gear much replayabilitythe fact xp gives game unique progress route really really really sad say loved alpha purchased bought hype defended game beta first came dont mind game mechanic changes know fun combat either die instantly die instantly nothing essentially challenging suddenly impossible mostly changes direction wollay moved support quite right would love developer active communication fans progressing game improvements withheld opinion looks obvious wollay going make famous disappearing act dont expect much point fun dont want get personal understand wollay said depressions etc cannot change supported strongly even many years every opportunity make amends community completely failed take advantage fact hes downright done wrong things hard sympathize someone cannot communicate whatsoever hope case even deepest depression right simply excuse self destructive behavior well self destruct away id love help cant even communicate rapport positive feelings wollay leading release im sick sorry game fun real sad im sad thanks wollay heck recommending playing straight hours progressed much better first hours game tried beta love cant wait play even rest week thanks wollay refunded completely different thought would considering last years fun play super frustrating get oneshot everything time regardless changes made throughout development game still graphics feel original cube world back hope developer changes back development cycle rather continuing develop one region lock improves replayability game immensely making possible keep playing game many hours initial region completed region lock much fun blue screen death actually would rather bsod pulls ram computer region lock bad game doesnt allow explore like alpha region lock kinda bummer specific mods remove best game ever still best game ever tbh region lock big brain move region locked gear punishing exploration real progression system lot announced features got cut development also dev clearly lacks basic communication skillsfeatures announced never made game housing advanced skill trees classes pet evolution certain bossmonsters vanity items spirit cubes pvpnot worth time region locked gear old exp skill leveling system removed unfriendly ux recommend playing beta especially think like alpha different game region locked gear artfacts skills basically neccessity traverse massive world original version would better release steam since least entertaining ride around pet levels effort get bent wolget bent glad didnt pay twice hope helps others pay ever region locked gearregion locked hang glider boat reinsno skill tree abilitiesregion locked fun beating one region feels like youve beaten whole game artifacts give speed light radius region locked items wouldnt recommend till skill trees real progression sort experience added game region locked items kind pain think remove would improve game overall friend fun game region locking really alpha better region locking spicy topic without region locking going eventually permanently level enemies region locking technically always something new zonei dont like removal would consider core mechanics sure take away stats new zone please dont take away boat half way along sea adventures please dont rip glider mid air travelling new zone mind core mechanics get forever wollay developer remove whole bunch locations would reason exist brings problem would say make non artifact adventure locations find glider boat higher level versions one previous glider boat costing less mana faster whatever stat improved endif region locking removed think emphasis enemies scaled go harder enemies excludes flying friends would start difficulty wherever system would entirely player side wherever started gear would scale infinitely alongside new difficulties system would probably work well leveling system go higher level would probably ditch star system unless instead used new glider system highlighted last paragraphdisregarding region locking entirely wish least form horizontal progression small non combat based stat improvements every time level removed game much larger bonuses artifacts stands artifact equipment carry zone zone bonuses small mean absolutely nothing cant feel progression might well therewollay recently went dark social media deleted reviews suggested excluding blog hope continues progress game wish best luck future keeping review recommend think steam reviewers harsh games even reactions justified eyesupdated steam nomination region locking terrible understand exists progression based around acquiring artifacts garbage game rewarding invest lot time think people wait buying alter review changed region thing fun remove region locked gear add levels add attacksskillsadd dungeonsquestsstories progressionthe game fun alpha remove region locked crap good game yeah remove dynamic make equipment useless replace less effective equipent lvl equipment remove region locked gear items maybe add linear questing system rpg elements proper server system game would great alpha way better imo removed skill treeremoved level systemwhy really liked game dont feeling anymoreremove remove going great removed things made game rewarding fun replaced boring walk around world game feel like playing dark souls steroids every time leave biome loot locked biome overall alpha much better game game became unrewarding play get satisfaction removing many mechanics replacing ones punish exploration kind fun really puts game much worse state years agothis games full release referenced monkeys paw years come reviewing games based upon prerelease versions ridiculous lot reviewers read come across emotional childish wont make game review based upon working model game release objectively incoherenti heard game day ago big fan minecraft missed generation games bought game kids experiment far great love graphics love music awesome job developerspostives graphics style musicnegatives cant hit escape exit game ui againwhy many reviewers game sound emotional child like feel sorry developers seem getting game rated series immature exlovers somehow feel emotionally slighted previous version game havent played game solid childlike emotional let would recommend game probably shouldnt listen people playing working builds game pre release seem kind whiny tbh right recommend alpha player free roaming progression levels talents skills etc loved old game gone region lock really really bad leveling gone talent treehope stuff gets readded back game wouldve stayed principle upgraded world quests items etci really wish wollay see reviews game consider changing back better state beforelove game right worth money sadly right worth moneythe alpha enjoyable right game fun regions game loses charm nice game around hours id say worth costs momentthe game showed much promise years ago alpha light content rough funthen came years silence last year teasing screenshots info new featuresthen beta came along allot changed better one problem progressionthe core gameplay fun game starts difficult get gear learn meganics gets betterafter short start quests conquering region problems start soon afterwhen leave region gear gets downgraded start like started first time form progression regions called artifacts find increase non combat abillities small amountthe developer stayed quiet concerns players likely wont anything adress issue right would recommend holding buying game current state least one two things occur improved progression system doesnt feel like creating new character move new region right equipment retains qualities region found andor modding community something improve note played alpha since steam even though steam mentions played less hour played alpha beta roguelite rpg missing lot features alpha im confident still added back ruined gamewas one favorite games developer legit broke everything made funremoved fighting xp removed currency systemno extra alpha buyers believed himremoved combat systemgame quest simulator nowrip good game least still alpha game maybe mod new stuff without crappy changes happyso back day bought game suddenly wasnt available everyone anymore everyone thought game deadi still hoped would come eventually day didzero money wasted glad could see pictures wolfram posting game twitter moment knew hasnt given upbut questionwhen would finish long years hoping often looking launcher updated nota days ago someone told could get steam key game like immediatly went site saw keyhappy times big big thank giving gameedit im honestly shocked people write negative reviews definitely people havent experienced depressioni mean big dreams developers want make game notice cant implement everything want agree level skill work something outwolfram dont listen negative people dont deserve long game makes happyi allowing comments people say opinion comment please adult dont negativity spreader people likely see remember negative experiences positive ones sad turned like thisloved alpha sad story great game l sad remember alpha much fun remember wollay ghosted everyone people would host alpha servers play much fun completely rekt skip let die like years ago wollay hope choke dry biscuit sadly completely different game alpha hope like region locked loot sadly years waiting received grade please dont throw game away update back supposed updates promised sadly gonna agree rest community alpha key initial release loved version game bits current version lacks lots made original cube world popular many blatant issues build game either addressed publicly changed rip cube world sadly seems like another mans sky case alot hype alot let game feels like gone backwards losing level system favor region system uses hopeful silence devs makes feel like really cant even say game might become good current state lacking reason play wish could recommend game sadly game supported alpha things subject change sure roadmap completely changed regionlocked gear punishment exploring enemies unable kill without gear get gear kill enemies get lucky vault drop die lot everything walking back takes minutes plus arent constantly farming respawn points also takes tons wandering skills gone class sort stand damage rogue others worth trying play solo without gearin hours managed one piece nice gear gets disabled soon cross arbitrary boundary still level artifacts desire play game dont care levelling item based xp based resetting progress every region kind removes point exploration adventure game turns grinding exact things per region sadly average average game could really great quests boring add story lore behind world tasks oftentimes reward enough effort wish could recommend game sadly cant especially dev going silent best wishes guy hope try sell another game many others give chance due quite frankly awfulnonexistent community interactions sadly cannot recommend game current state punch face regional equipment great incentive exploration game focused exploration sadly beta deviated far away original premise game alpha really fun opinionif youre zeldalike get item move ahead repeat might exploration wont get much itthe game punishes exploring really loved alpha want proceed new biom lose items levels lack progression makes game fun everything earn every monster defeat means nothing grand scheme things everything resets go new biomit sucks giving game thumbs especially since ive following loving years many bad game design choices made made getting game worth opinion sadly game disappointing wanted like theres lot promise year radio silence theres reason buy game would suggest buying unless new update comes unlikely reviews update good sadly great tiny little game made massive design shift become game thats fun play reviews likely catalog issues detail mine upshot fun play due intense difficulty extremely limited read almost progression mechanics take progress made render uselessif changes ill change review issues everyone else progression fun rpg elements removed gameit needs serious updates could recommend save money maybe another years big publisher might bought turned something good playablepretty disappointed point save money move maybe real update come dont believe screenshots promise anything save moneythe game updated think beyou get bored least hoursthere nothing interesting past point trulydo buy game support developer seeing game hitting steam made really excited long since alphato keep short game needs work lot starts fine exploring spawnregion completing first quests fun gameplay gets stale quickly fact every region resets almost hardearned equipment upon entering help feeling least players alpha didnt pay steamversion theres seems fun theory fun friends seeing dev posting disappeared yet probably wise investment bought way back original release ive constantly disappointed seems like game abandoned like six years ago alpha release game also less fun play compared alpha version due extensive gameplay changes contains plenty bugs setting aside comparisons alpha cannot recommend game especially current price comes single question whats pointgear region locked equipment going one region ships needed explore ocean biomes means travel locked regions well game exploration penalizes exploring thats okay since map uncovered completely anyway tell landmarks get items minutes studying mystery whats next hill already knowartifacts help move faster increase light radius bonus combat fighting enemies pointless unless want gear becomes useless next region crafting recipes region locked well time get already better gear upgrading weapons pointless since weapons region lockedthe equipment issue could solved making kingdom based instead region based nothing drives player explore kingdoms time youve obtained artifacts tools single region youve seen entire gameplay loopthe game also riddled bugs release makes obtaining gear items impossible doors blocked terrain impossible get binding climb hangglider single button default makes scaling certain places troublesomei really wanted like game see released state disappointment shallow gameplay unfufiling grindprogression rolls back every hours terrible difficulty manage remove make combat even skillless alphas rng dictate much fun havesalvageable progression rework heavy balancing needed cant recommend writing review shit game better back day short sweet review good game different alpha necessarily bad way going game need treat like completely different game short sweet game fun aesthetically pleasing worth price tag though feel could get hours wanting play longerim confident developers improve game given time inputcons artifacts useless need reward player crafting weapon designing become useless shame one fun things alpha spirits removed well big needs combat balances quests repetitive interesting mobs drop amount gold besides bosses material limits quite low enough crafting recipes dungeons quite easy parkour typically super simple puzzles anything combat dungeons dont many secrets loot get sometimes get artifacts one region another amount work effort water mage ability r useless lolpros artifact leveling system unique fresh region locking specifics items enhancing replayability multiplayer easy extremely fun combat fun skill based aesthetic beauitfulideas future pet features leveling system skills better skills passive skills ability change hairstyles cosmetics hats wing particles emotes depth classes racesim missing lot things feel said others communitylove short answer worth price little content much left outgot game back alpha didnt amount content feel like progressing account however seems passion wollay pixxie back may lost made version way done iti hope wrong isnt end dont much hope considering entire beta last week one time acknowledged community feedback current core system gameonly small changes like skill tree skill points artifacts varying new abilities change play class scaling regions based type amount artifacts achieve would make much better game short answer game alright beginning pretty hard especially play solo enemies lot stronger progression pretty quick pace lucky enough find high star weapons armor pretty refreshing get new area spending hours one kinda demotivating cant keep inventory collect new weapons armor fair theme really fun start got really repeadative friends game definitly easier mor fun short storyme three friends enjoying game much flaws sure overshadowed depth complexity im reminded procedural odd generation happenslong storyive followed cube world since remember alpha release great exploration intense initial difficulty eventually turned hunt reported map seeds became overpowered everything else followed wolframs development since via tweets community discord excited primarily determination test different styles gameplay something provided satisfaction surprised removed xp even persisted release today im glad became case love gear longer levellocked every drop discovery enjoyed immediately love doesnt take absurd amounts time find high rarity gear becomes obsolete levels love increased density meaningful locations well things find places love game continues provide great challenge fully exploring several regions agree however artifacts provide stronger bonuses possibly configurable augmentation classs skills currently mobility improvements felt hours playingfeedback provide beginners guide explaining combat mechanics ie dodging direct blows recovers mp remove reigns make pet riding default ability compliment every town basic roaming pets dogscatsbunnies appropriate pet food sale let every region hold minimum artifacts unless region especially small let increases artifacts three times greater change augment class skills configurable ways quest window filtered region ordered difficulty lore window filtered kingdomregion ordered chronologically positional sound stereo speakers please shortly game went live wrote negative review state game also knowing history developer disappearing acts never know even game ever get update deleted hoped could proven wrong wait see approachgame released september december outcry wondering developer long enough reply literally anyone literally anything twitter updates nothing silent years could silent years time knows cant recommend game developer completely ignoring playerbase years end right release steam seems like cashed took ball went home thankfully since bought game alpha many years ago got free steam least fun alpha modders turning game around though refuse recommend game developer released early access removing rpg elements making easy get items removing items time pass another area plain dumb dev needs listen people make fixes game love look feel game much potential wasted work bringing back features players liked alpha version sick game especially friends bit grindy though since game region locked make sense end since get powerful enough literately one shot things within given region unless golden boss mob key items get annoying collect region however likely find quests also gives game extra layer difficulty aside though wish zones bigger would less hassle reclaim key items dont mind getting like zones within map go repeatedly grabbing key items get boring quick wish zones bigger maybe like aside aspect though really love multiplayer fact keep items friends worlds honestly awesome instead starting like different save files definitely keep playing game lots things explore cant wait next update similar opinion others rerelease isnt good alpha youre looking improved game isnt however despite mistakes think developer made game still maintains lot potential update game reasonable rate regard communitys feedback game still become worthwhile play simply worth sad say many people high hopes game sadly deliver completely ruined would amazing game simply put cube world beta nothing cube world alpha promised complete rework thats wont recommend since redeemed code reciveing beta able play game pc

recommend game asis said thankfully hope wollay believe still working gamea recent teaser proven based image looks like itll address issues thatre present gameto even surprise hype wollay decide stick guns work game honestly im gratefuleven communication isnt end pulling around fixing issues ill flipping review soon possible desperately look forward improvementsthank tons wollay first heard game released steam extremely excited long time fan waiting update since game released alpha bought game alpha many hours release beta still excited see updates wollay couldnt wait try beta downloaded beta realized things changed removal leveling system skill system little disappointed still optimistic adventured throughout first region doubts quickly proven wrong rarity weapons equipment still provided feeling progression however soon figured region lock equipment fatal flaw beta release makes progression within game feel pointless thing really matters getting artifacts ive heard add minor stat boosts things like glider speed boat speed things dont matter either use boats gliders within region found wanted fully take advantage stat boosts would find equipment every time enter new region opinion repetitive pointless hope wollay realizes fatal flaws within new version see cries community bringing back leveling skill systems removing region lock would make game times better playing alpha think better also think gliders boats reigns purchasable usable everyone like alpha solve region lock problem separate region could increase difficulty based biome forest regions easy tundra regions medium lava regions hard example read wollay thank youve done please fix flaws make things like change review positive wollay manages address issues fix games current state dont recommend however problems addressed opinion may change tldr new version removes lot made original great good additions however removal leveling skill systems added region lock make progression pointless bringing back leveling skill systems removing region lock would immediately fix lot betas problems games current state dont recommend start years change gameplaymap revealed leveling region locked gear makes game alpha spent countless months playing saying blast playing last day good potential get better go places yes played years ago yes looking forward building house extra goodies gonna get still cube world art music exploring loved came gotta smart things wolly would one thing would bring house making something wanted bad good game look forward sinking hours months untill get bored new content im hoping new content features let add one major thing wolly gave game alpha players didnt care would made us pay keep leaving negative comments leave cube world never work please kill game absolutely still recommend game despite interesting changes happened since alpha back npcs somewhat useful skip nights artifacts lore scavenger hunting fast travelthings im uncertain include removal level removal skill trees removal quests biomelocking gear seeming removal world selectionall still super rough means finished product im still optimistic could certain things tweaked slightly things reimplementedhonestly really like skill trees dig whole biome specific loot system id like something kind like option choose systems world creation least bought game alpha usd got one free simple fun progressed saved character items skills levels character could take different worlds lose progress similar terraria world entire randomly generated infinit world much like minecraft still borders wouldnt reset progress every time crossed themi highly recommend watching youtube videos people playing alpha favorite person watch ethoslabeven though alpha infinite level grind real goal still manageable game years later gigantic step backwards maybe people havent played alpha dont feel way however even alphas fewer skills content still outweighs additions game simply border system recommend game need work balance content developers deserve attention trying something new even particular loved public something need new ways playing games agree lot things said cube world progression feeling moment particularly strong artifacts levels need reviewing additions gear system stand good innovative forces players work rewards items used exploration problem tho would better instead loosing hand glider boat reins things like reduced effectiveness gathering would giving small increases speed stamina etc short unique game focused making players explore world bad good points like games people complaining mostly ones addicted level grinding alpha version witch years old lot things still progress game early access devs want people try creation get feedbacks help make game better wish mixed option game definitely dont flat recommend game dont outright condemn either guess ill go recommending virtue devs silent ill explain whats good bad gamefirst game needs proper fucking tutorial nothing explained nothing youre dropped world right next monsters probably cant kill expected figure since people expecting combat game first thing theyd try fight enemies get frustrated easy die real penalty dying respawn nearest respawn point youve unlocked dont know find respawn points end way back place started one important aspects game learning look map find respawn points also fast travel points important points interest lore reveal location artifacts town purchase upgrades crafting materials never taught also taught identify enemies color name determines strength enemy color health bar determines theyre enemies red passive green friendly blue finding friendly npcs also important later game doesnt explain important identify youre expecting fight everything see game disappoint greatlyso dont fight every monster come across play game well heart exploration game world divided regions region number points interest stumble across learn talking friendly npcs objective challenge rating determined color corresponds color gear essentially wander around find challenge actually complete collecting resources around world along way getting stronger complete quests important ones complete trader gnomes books crafting directly influence ability get stronger allowing obtain better gear since progression entirely gear based every quest reward gear still progress challenge handlethe capstone region dungeons contain artifacts artifacts provide small bonuses convenience mostly related movement speed using tools acquire inside region hang gliding speed riding speed require reigns etc get artifacts region move another region heres kicker b leave region lose everything except bonuses artifacts craftingconsumable stockpiles gold b intended mechanic game one thats explained works within context game exploring anything else allows reexperience getting stronger excitement finding purple item pushes ahead forcing lose strength spent time building engaging lot people youre okay constantly starting far strength concerned game never explained core mechanic gameso negative reviews justified people bought game thought something wasnt upset rather enjoy game first two hours almost quit frustration finally learned everything needed know take entire two hours figure play game review isnt guide didnt include everything know like classes weapons specializations work fact need one understand basic gameplay mechanics ludicrous im going honest rating game would depended price spent quite bit time playing previously friends huge part reason iw able much fun didbut realistically beat one area youve already done entire game isnt much fine love mindless things games kind gets boring region lock isnt really big issue werent thing next area previouslyive seen called gameplay loop honestly thing guess end game nothing youve beaten area stuff repeated wouldnt care much things next area different theyre mention soon cross border start walking either way fun bit dollars worth fun long years cube world released beta today alpha vet got enjoy game week advance done god begin game focused exploration wollay sure everything power make exploration mindnumbing facedesking repetitive dull grind worst offender region locking every biome map region full magic items equipment work area set one foot outside region items region immediately rendered useless really inhibits ability go region totally nukes ability anything especially hard enter say ocean region didnt get lucky find boat first island visited like youre going bvery unfun time b regards equipment incredibly rare chance youll find equipment plus used multiple regions conquering four regions ive found one legendary item shoulderpads items make exploring areas bit nicer get punished wandering farthen theres progression system made clear levels skill trees entirely gone matters gear gear rng based also region locked trek across land finding special items travel less tedious avoiding anything stronger almost everything low equipment levels trying find better gear sure nice get stronger better looking gear able conquer foes leads towards tackling artefact dungeons boy artefact dungeonsartifacts goddamn useless saying right seriously first time fought way tooth nail artefact dungeon finally made end chest artefact inside looking forward map said increased lamp radius range measly metres opened chest got artefact felt proud looked stats lamp radius gone didnt know say knew artefacts waste time almost scour lands lore culture pretty neat get past lore knowledge lore thing increases knowledge culture shows artefacts culture across multiple regions upgrades artefacts give teeny tiny additions travel abilities tied special items anyway sure improvements arent region locked miraculously theyre completions sake dungeons usually give decent equipment loot besidesin regards lore real purpose seems help find relics youll see npcs wondering around world often faction tag druids mana cult desrist gronot cult kingdom gamodt thing tags seem determine group npc adventurers hostile theres faction quests faction leaders long questlines faction strongholds capital cities meaningful faction anything etc lot teased past years weve come see none also easy forget lore stuff isnt written ingame journal anything youre told dates heroes wars forget doesnt matter anywayalso craftings useless region locking sense investing materials one region unless youve gotten really unlucky havent found good enough gear oh wait need find crafting books make legendary gear whoopeefinally rather easy criticise complete lack thereof developer communication wollay wife infamous hermits emerging hovels year show stuff cube world half hasnt made games beta release state sure things may change course absolutely idea things change dev duo arent known taking even valid constructive criticismwhile dont hate game gotten fun world set feels hollow ive come across couple interesting things like entire village petrified witch went killed witch breaking curse expecting like validation efforts villagers didnt seem notice one might like villages leaders anythingoverall cant validly recommend game state alright fun friend conquering regions map felt little reason go already felt like id seen everything game offer hindsight didnt feel like something thats gone years work vacuum game probably worth since cube world alpha exists definitely worth anything straight worseheres whats worse new versionlist skill tree character progression start skills dont get stronger way cant sort inventory cant zoom scroll wheel zooms map binds zoom dont work leftovers never drop class useable thing received rings amulets gear region locked including boat hang glider seriously wollay must trolling nobody could possibly think thats good idea people say get gear complete zone still rare get item ive seen one drop course different class ninja completely ruined might side effect skill trees noted ive played rogue stars throw second cooldown beginning game find waiting cooldown damage literally anything killing mobs rewarding exp mobs far open world would issue previous point wasnt true crafting useless region lockinglistnow whats betterlist map nicer teleporting im sure good bad though exciting find portals alpha music added bosses easier determine kill less unreasonable amounts health although unreasonable amounts damage still world bosses sort worth killing unlike alpha gave cubes often couldnt used pseudoquests daily quests gonelistyeah thats find alpha version play long ago purchased game unhappy uninstalled totally forgot ita months ago started wonder cube world almost like asked friend told moved steam distribution result reinstalled reacquiring key currently ive put hours still dont know feel gameso races jobs specializations thats getyoure dropped world little ceremony first thin need talk people get locations need explore

cute colorful voxel game retro feel isnt unpleasant tutorial guidance game play game isnt going thing actually best thing compare minecraft figure game play got figured funhowever first hours

finished gamethat doesnt mean dont like really new levelingsytem horriblethe problem region locking enemys way strong areas starting low lvl gear makes exploration impossiblegive back alpha took quite bit time actually enjoy game needs work overall might worth sticking around wollay fix said radio silence wrong cant communicate fanbase needs someone liked pretty sure youll like first hours unfortunately dont feel characters growth much problem game character become weak enter new region thats whats issue youll consistently level character person played alpha version noticed lot improvements great game youll get tired play hours however lot fun solid game worth wait end game balanced around multiplayer however classes outshine others leveling reliant relics dont feel like

regionand procedural stuff impressive sorry wollay coming early buyer wanted game well progress well messed big time sorry wollay dislike changes hope mods change game base vanilla game nope wouldnt say worth hope wollay comes back game dont think sorry much loved game journey towards release date recommend buy developers incorporate feedback people giving something past years sorry say game dissapointed mei fanatic follower cubeworld since alpha got released game isnt anymore every feature made game fun taken away game shadow exp skilltree cant even keep gear going new zone progression make finding artifacts permanently increase stats stats provided artifacts subpar barely worth effort real reason engage combat since exp stuff monsters drop dissapear anyway crafting isnt neccesary either need tons mats best craftable gear cant even keep things worth crafting potions basically point anything gametldr rpg without features rpg sorry years waiting game worse alpha depresion excusewhere skilltree inventorywhere anythingnobody knows game tells nothing nobody knowsmaybe someone things good thing isntyes could get option menu searchbut good game designsome things strait dont

tsk tsk sad releasethe alpha much promise perfect base create fantastic gameyet wollay managed change game point doesnt make sensecube world exploration yet game actively punishes exploringwollay added region locks means gearloot essentially null void region one gained means start beginning every regionlevelling removed skill trees progression game cant progress levels also cant progress better gear due region lockingthe map completely visible means lot excitement exploring removedoverall would recommend avoiding game wollay listens fans changes game shame come back edit review cant give positive reviewi one people bought game back years ago came back school back played game whole weekend wanted moreafter month game died completely updates received minor fixes bug fixes controller supporti really enjoy game back high hopes future cube years later receive steam key alpha ownership dont get wrong thing back minus school part genuinely loved game point going gift game many friends make full party really enjoy game week passed despite promises nothing came two weeks started getting negative like many others already time full month release updates game received prerelease phase impact alpha updates developer went radio silent notice patterni hope one day ill able change review leave positive one developer cares community like one inexcusable look somewhere else fun game play friends heard minecraft modded pretty good super fun first gets boring quick sure love dying hour straight stupid high level monster starting zone best game ever kappa sure different alpha game still awesome know isnt normal rpg adventure game like every differently unique wayyou take zone little contained adventure variety themes keep interesting theyre like questing campaigns progress unlock nextyou start fighting white difficulty green blue purple finish yellow gear get shown colours know youre good enough fight level monster hard game dont understand basic concept realise whats going becomes much easier progressto help new players feel developer implement small starting island use tutorial guide people systems work let face white monsters drop couple green items face green monsters get blue drops etc shown get teleported land based biome play game real least done get someone new startedthe game issues fear much longevity different types biomes visited experienced started hills biome dont wish enter another hills itll however quite different varieties get dont expect quick game done likely wont want repeat previous biome types course helped game updates introduce new lands play developer continues development past launchone particular issue experienced started ocean biome stranded village island confusing new player couldnt find monsters kill villagers explain could see lands distant thought surely im expected swim reach hadnt known time ocean biome required finding sailing boat first teaming friend played able understand doin conclusion fun game hard people making best look game works jumping take watch inthelittlewoods basic guide youtube get excellent start sure different alpha game know loved completely turned around core gameplay understand everyone alpha playerbase theres lot fun especially friends take game purely fun experience opinion gather friends like region based system youll lot fun doesnt mean game doesnt come glaring flaws need fixed though artifacts almost worthless plus gear way rare finding quests frustrating twenty euros theres lot playtime lot fun especially first time playing biome type time youre done youve got well worth money switching review dislike like friend blast theres game thought would exploring gathering powerful gear isnt difficult started new area completing first area dont lose everything traveling new areas either full restart like people claim one problem gameits region locking install better progression mod game perfect see cube world learning curve people leaving negative reviews either didnt install mod theyre plain bad video games noobs everywhere map generation game absolutely astounding better minecraft also world map beautiful thing ive ever seen time play spend good minutes exploring map beautiful world full many hidden treasures im still finding something new time play theres also many different creatures discover tame like pokemon lmao want experience games full potential install better progression mod shouldnt hard find popular mod mod also works multiplayer make sure mates installed toospeaking multiplayer seamless easy experience invite friends steam theyre inbuy game play friends worth dont bother listening filthy casuals theyre salty theyre bad game game amazing cant believe waited years game finally ive enjoying far really happy works idk cause im honeymoon phase might like later far good still hope added time likely scam early access cash brought quite years ago played lotit fun game lacked real content lot grindthe addition teleport spawn points nice helpfulbutits step back since like anymoreit released dropped update years counts dropped update came along something fish money steam ea good game buy youre allowed kill many slaughter maybe make nwsw mod aswell axampel give dog pp also gives ugli monster called rock man comes sometimes kill mountian buy gives better item axample gold ax one shit shot monsters everyone kills changed biome everything items becomes useless canot use become shit okay sistem someone like someone dont likes mybe like bittle lit dunno also gives hidden yiff owo uwu succy sexy fox pp nice fox pp nice everyone like fox pp big knot swallow cummies choked suffocate pp yeach game good buy allowed tldr like alpha probably wont hoped wollay please respond communityin current state needs work really hope wollay responds community instead going ghost another years loved game alpha doesnt really feel anymore lot mechanics made great arent im sure right move different know cant start square one theres still much good beta many awesome ideas planned earlier old website cities skill progression etc people wanted disregarded mention undesirable new changes region locked boats hang gliders gear removal skill trees leveling dont know game put week beta drastic changes got hyped im sad hope find courage face harshness communitys criticismi consider changing review wollay listens community even little though best track record tldr game worth money dont faith developer ability deliver gameupdate still new content fact updates past first weekthe truth new content added six years took update come game moved sideways yes true game still built great foundations alpha revealed reality game still alpha quests repetitive flat boring combat okay nearly engaging enough thing game going say want new region locking artifacts main problem main problem developers lack motivation ability make real gamethere little risk buying game entire gameplay loop lasts hours always refund time wish could leave positive review enjoy game currently expensive maybe im wrong edit review coming months updates turn around tldr try become beta player dont salty alpha playerhonestly really good game buy try lot negative reviews coming alpha players waited years game go beta didnt turn expected ya cool features gone still really cool game totally worth region lock isnt bad anyway make sure getting item moving next zone use items adjacent zones got item also working hard one zone allow find bunch lore easily see artifacts arei recommend game highly although believe artifacts difficulty could changed think artifacts give better stats becomes case think monsters get harder away starting zone change artifacts difficulty help game thrive tldr cubeworld good game still needs polish theres promise thatll happen tell game made two people somewhat emptiness low density doesnt make badcubeworld game immense level hype behind since first announced hype gotten ahead enjoy game would recommend need updates reworkings make game worthwhile play beyond first biome completeyou see cubeworld rpg stripped leveling system instead power affinities based gear thing gear works biome found spend hours character one biome complete fully restart whole thing next biome find boats hang gliders free unfortunately also usable within biome found means ocean biomes involve lot boring swimming manage find boat also unfortunately due lack rider skill ride pets get reigns also cannot taken biomesthe overarching progress make relics explore far wide find lore points assist locating take dungeon get minor stat increase faster swimming climbing better diving slightly increased lantern light radiusi wish rpg elements wish catered overarching experiences push go biome biome rather please particular reasonthe combat good hard first later hard cross biome border ive played almost exclusively ranger sniper using shadow clone ability double seconds every minute use ranged attacks advantage climbing mountain tree shooting powerful bosses making sure stagger fall right near top perch rinse repeat get good gear dont need cheese hell difficult encountersthe warrior started hours ago much powerful basic enemies due ability heal percentage hit getting enough hits also makes bosses harder due decreased damage taken increased damage outputim going anywhere ill finish saying like could still use polish got borderlands terraria feeling get good rare gear also starbound feeling nothing specifically matters cant really get attached area youre passing rather making truly valuing enjoying itedit months later honestly game somewhat hard come back first areas every character definitely needs content hope comes faster game tldr dont buy game dont definitely worth timei originally bought game years ago released alpha expected beta full release arrive relatively soon least resemble alpha boy wrong took roughly years beta full release come alright wollay made amazing promises would added game wrong beta full release dont even resemble original alpha game promises made deleted gone awol simply dont understand wollays reasoning yes game thousands paying customers simply havent received payed forwollay simply took game game leaving couple hours fun best havent played alpha iswollay cant even handle crititcism agree people bit harsh awol since sept simply unacceptable tldr thing alpha released game updates right beginning left yearsyou dont screw player base two times think thats okay waited years getting drip fed updates game expanding going bigger skill trees sub classes indepth quest lines playable races even talk building house settling city one point supposed cities huge aqueducts stuff better dungeons think even hints puzzles dungeons going coolbut doesnt matter talk expanding game something great lie get instead opposite got smaller biomes map arent even skills anymore feels like released version prealpha build get game wants really shafted us usi never understand couldnt keep us loop come updates periodically couple times year even something show work done receive feedback people actually playing game people willing help give feedback anything could help game loved believed could even set forum like respect points something active respected players community could idk doesnt matter wanted kill game deadim upset cool game excited believed long potential wasted tldr trash dont waste money itbought alpha hoped would one day become nice game didnt gave one point actually forgot popped steam went fetch alphacode activated steam tried still waste somehow even managed reduce features game compared alpha looks like last attempt getting cash itgameplay wise kinda fun realize steps really really boring way works go city grab quests get go andventuring freeing merchants collecting good stuff like better gear glider etc youve done go next area new set quests thats realize progress made previous area simply nullified quests cause appearantly dev thinks thats cool next area start scratch sounds like fun right also gear bound zone found guess means gets nullified aint great game hrs true gameplay lacks severely fun proper mechanics department overall steaming trashpile questionable yyrs ago yikes tldr game fun cyclical future looks brightlet start saying ive playing cube world since bought back im personally glad see changes made since wollay promised fun game thats exactly still thats say think stop years ago cube world ambitious indie game boasting combinations game mechanics one ever thought infinitely scalable rpg part thats exactly said game far perfect regionlocking items charm first becomes grindy first biomes artefacts scale stats small percents thus become less less useful collect dont grind dozens monsters able sail ride even glide immediately kicked enter new biome find collectables resetall aside see great start game still high hopes future hopefully publicly available help demonstrate areas game need changed rebalanced order bring best experience possible tldr relaxing exploration questing solocoop game unique way progress great soundtrack fits exploration part worth wait money would wait years againthe game never lost charms six years waiting update approve added cuteness quests monstrosities songs buildings mechanicsyou pet pet heck yeahevery npc somewhat different message damn love compliments styledid community complain worth waiting yes absolutelydoes community still complain complaints justified really yes way progress different game ive played still cool engaging mechanic lets focus exploring also focus gamedoes progress mechanic need fix somewhat rewards artifacts feel underwhelming comparison stay one area changes like every boat find makes boat go faster able wear gear everywhere would awesome prefer levelling system new way progress absolutely maybe little changes mentioned tldrfun fun friends severely punishes solo players six years market seems like features removed addedexploration actively punished enemies still massively overpowered others massively underpoweredhere go wish could say wait worth im still glad game enemy mages appear level player still destroy health bar area start find things kill easily many kill easily wellcombat improved little severe disparity power immediate opponents pets kinda useless die easilyoriginally could buy hang glider use anywhere find one new area find one next new area find another climbing claws dumb alpha game leveling would make stronger let improve climbing gliding combat abilities find climbing claws area climb eternity leveling isnt really leveling combat improves looting items go kill enemies loot kill stronger enemies loot kill even stronger enemies loot crafting system still little annoying crafting large amounts item eventually speeds taking time craft items games isnt balancing simply inconvenient waste time dungeons used best part game rush

punishing exploration players receive loot classes use way often completely possible win tough fight rewarded one piece loot use weaker already posses along three pieces loot classesim glad game seems instead adding features features taken away tldr horrible multiplayer experience dont play multiplayer bad reviews yet good game wait sale edit changed recommended multiplayer still unplayable due synchronization issues still havent fixed ok nearly everyone complains aboutall true every new zone means new equipment started playing game knowing though actually bad game really different playing

customization weapons still thing still cool wasnt literally didnt matter game theres reason improve weapons thats fine though im patient person even though slightly disappointed kept playing really kill stars occasionally melee stars even hours game ive shown little improvement ready grind watched video telling go things help travel get boat hang glider climbing spikes sky whistle harp bell still improvement thats fine wanna get slowly surely feel satisfaction come across first sky island im really excited immediately go hoping sort combat buffwell got hours game got star great mace class everything couldnt fight died little effort felt like someone cheat coded game take straight end beat star dungeon basically soon started rewarding fun take scaling enemies leveling system cool dungeons replace rng system feels bland every quest area hard took seconds wipe lvl bosses rpg get lucky drop win game go hope thing happens next region tldri cannot recommend game anyone current

honestly think people overreacting somewhatone things people dont seem like region basically restart alpha reached level time kinda run things version theres incentive complete quests game never really gets point everything easy tedious game experience travelsal chore therefore exploration damaged terrible cash grab wish wasnt blinded hype game waited reviews roll bought terrible decisions dev made final product worth installing would strongly recommend trove damni really enjoyed alpha version years back terrible game years development game feels empty alpharegion locked gear joke time get best gear region pointless since move onto next anyway top important items boat glider make actually getting around map somewhat bearable also locked exp skill tree remove thing made player feel like continuously progressing characters actually gave purpose killing mobs artefacts joke way come close replacing original system benefits actually provide laughably bad practically none existentthe good changes opinion new map inventory thats itdo favour buy game terrible update polished alpha version released thatthere real progression game nearly everything pointless redo every regiondo buy game unless enjoy starting game scratch every time venture past region thank waiting update created character serious note game alpha days something lacked alot content yet enjoyed many hours im glad

voice carries importance choose go forward releasing game hopefully one day change review positive good game destroyed eh hours first gameplay fun progress mechanism bad lose stuff switched region dont recommend buy game fixed version better year dream gone know know dont enjoy years nearly silent development version game alone january wollay tweeted screenshots game still including expfor reason wollay changed core mechanics last months years updates got something like version januarywhat seemed like refined alpha would outcry people would still mad taking years people would loved refined alphathe current version suffers lack real progression first hours reason venture new area lose real progress made changes suppose help replayability ended killing games general playability powerful gear feels way easy obtain main form progression doesnt even feel earned gear system feels like wollay realized bad new system refusing revert old system artifacts practically useless making feel form overall progression throughout regionsi see people saying things like isnt suppose alpha never promised game wollays make cant agree alpha show less polished version final product look like case alpha seems well thought version game got gutted rework parts game cube world seems target whole different audience rather targeting people bought twitter main form periodic communication long wait new update saw improved alpha longest time game suddenly changed year justified people shocked state current yes wollays game shield criticism especially true turns lot fans current gamewollay spent years seemed refined alpha threw work away spent months transforming game fundamentally different version game would love make review recommending game currently cant recommend even bring play version alpha better plain simple husk game oozing soul game able sink many many hours despite alpha state removal gaining xp killing mobs seems questionable seeing character level way level acquire lackluster artifacts give garbage boost eg increase much light lantern emits also used skill trees class appear axed game something else ive noticed biomes seem less dramatic interesting alpha makes wonder world generation also changed maybe thats rngtheres also myriad features wollay teased didnt make way game ironically pantsonhead retarded feature added game regionlocked equipment remember fancy purple boomerang found completing quest well useless outside region found goes things like boats well youre sailing boat one region cross another automatically unequip boat cant use region find

uninstalling better games style alpha version lot better hey still fun game use cheat engine lol alpha version better alpha better alpha fun issues road map cube worlds website detailing mechanics extra things could added later many fun systems removed game experience systems pets less skill tree etcthese systems replaced gear based progression system lasts hours hit top tier gear get around players reaching endgame hours developer thought would good idea cripple gear progression player worked whenever entered new region enter new region characters power set back zero forced start even lose glider boatyou get around neighboring areas using gear however gear exceedingly rare take multiples hours find low tier piecegear based progression done properly seen terraria absolute worst implementation ever seenif goes sale could snag fun friends base game fun decent bit explore quick game giving little motivation go another region completing area alpha great full release let would recommend anyone buying version wollay updates game probably never alpha worse came balancing however better exploration wisetldr get game want balanced multiplayer experience alphas design superior honest opinion region locking feels like punishes player makes weaker ripping away gear worked hard get polish game alpha absolutely clear shame took different path terms design one seemed promising cant recommend game honestly bums looked forward release years cant even recommend game sale art style still amazing glimmer soundtrack wonderful listen everything gone alpha different game improves seen steam library review positive many features working fine build take away game basic fact developer ran game shows dedicated seeing game well thing grabbed money ran still waiting single update game hasnt since release best game played undoubtedly best game ive ever played ive since initial release like beta fun first got bored run around new regions getting equipment gear back region lock gets changed game could amazing big lmaoski big oof biggest challenge game right convincing players bought game years ago current game progression gear vs xpleveling based better access years many bitter pill swallow mind made one system delivered different many giving honest chance almost afterthought also essentially early access even past week good quality changes feedback given convincing brand new game try regardless negativenonconstructive reviews written quality negative reviews quality positive ones game different anticipated bit hesitant well hours regions cleared enjoying system even though quite different traditional rpg trajectory kill mob get xp get betterfasterstronger rinse repeatoverall give shot open mind like biggest disappointment game years good example communication crucial game development process biggest problem game developer released alpha set expectation game actually released different alpha made people angry different look reviews notice majority negative reviews make reference alpha majority positive reviews thats really need know played alpha expecting something like may like game however played alpha looking something another cookiecutter rpg chances may like game like came current state isnt worth playing empty shell tried really hard enjoy game cant developers decision change game gear based progression system terrible idea feeling actually accomplishing anythingyet like years ago word developers planning next even went far delete blogso anyone interested purchasing game put time money something else central conceits drew people excited game silently thrown trash six long years spent cooking absent eyes bothered giving time money energy first placethis beyond starboundlevel mistakeif excited cube world isnt game changes alpha certainly baffling confusing honestly give chance definitely perfect dont like everything thats changed wollay tried something new progression get every similar game expect pretty sizable changes way implemented right world beautiful exploration combat super fun rewardinguntil start next zone zone dozen hours plus worth content maybe hold buy alpha think worth playing changes made game since alpha make absolutely sense whatsoever seems developer took loved mechanics game replaced shittier mechanics really makes question thought process implementing changes concept great idea fact hunt artifacts every area encounter terrible way fix bring back lvling system instead hunting system also make enemies get stronger get stronger way encourages work hard lvling another idea might help game travel father away first spawn enemies also get stronger ways help game concept game awesome wasnt pulled well first many bugs already ruined game one equipment disappearing also whole leveling system annoying pointless people want getting stronger killing enemies without even leveling pointless really underwhelming could become great soon major fixes core game lot fun absolute blast playing beta first day unbeknownst would happen step first region character never progresses past movement speed combatexploration mix like playing two different games doesnt feel like complete game since full release expected feel like full gamecube world absolute blast game around hours moment theres real reason keep playing since move enemies dont drop better items gold etc mention loss movement items like reigns glider etc pls fix core gameplay game good major issues show hours game look tips play get friend two fun whilethere big issues torn recommend positives barely outweigh negativesdo go game high expectations playing hundreds hours core gameplaycombat enjoyable ever mostly unaltered alpha returning alpha addition many new featuresquest types issue stems lack progression options wont take long till devs come one another ways fix definitely worth purchase like voxel styled adventure rpg games core game really fun proper open world adventure explore zone freely tame pets craft gear potions explore dungeons fight enemies quests get new key items let access locked dungeons bonus areas open new travel options including reins let ride pet progress given area gain strength enemies used run away become viable targets dungeons got rooms rookie something tackle main goal given area collect artifacts youll need best gear often zones key items get usually found end dungeons artifacts give bonus convenience stat riding speed climbing speed stuff like collected zone move next zone choice causing gear marked take neighboring zones jumpstart key items effectively reset letting experience climb top food chain bonuses artifacts permanent stat increases zone artifacts getting point collect zone takes somewhere hours gameplay loop fun gameplay loop unusual like lotwhere gets controversial progression system end collecting artifacts gaining levels levels counter many artifacts artifacts collect main goal game give small convenience bonuses might cleared last zone small percentage bonus hang glider speed slightly larger radius lampthere higher level zones training character goal like getting level enter dungeon big bad boss anything conquer zones collect artifacts fun nothing elsethis turn people especially system change alpha even though like game different adventure zone wish levels meant wish something permanent reward adventures miniscule bonus convenienceshopefully theres going content added later make efforts meaningful id advise treating game like sand mandala accept impermanence enjoy process crafting system broken spend hours collecting wood fibers make weapon armor piece make go shop feet away always something better items shop cost gold way quicker gather crafting materials theres point crafting collect gold items thing worth craftingi still play game combat still pretty fun always fun add new pet collection dungeons dont good challenges patrols need hide makes unsafe linger one spot clear room aggroing one stationary soldier time youve reduced something easy whenever find secret treasure room cross fingers cool weapon armor instead bag money good thing dungeons bosses parkour rooms pets dont die drop lava pit follow younew regions explore cool found cocoa beans ground got excited new fruit collect snowberries oceans boring completely deserted everything happens islandsalpha felt finished enough complete game missing quests full release feels unfinished hope keeps getting developed though stuff feels unfinished would like crafting system fixedthe steam review forces choose yes wish could choose neutral would recommend friend could play multiplayer cube world release steam nice breath fresh air alpha version played shy hrs say enjoyed far continue playi give cube world current game absolute downgrade alpha version added content quest system world generation incredible good matters little game broken core content removed process regionlocked progress lazy way artificially increase playtime doesnt give sense progression since everything goes back gliding speed progression without counting artifact upgrades get progressively weaker accomodate dumb idea lot cool actual fun content like skills skill trees others like enemies structures didnt make game infinite progression system alpha great seeing character grow become stronger stronger felt really great could actually go wherever want stopped strong enemies could actually taken player skill impossible since strong enemies take damage also skill trees helped complete control wanted strengthen play character needed options wouldve perfect sad seeing game current stateanother reason negative review lack communication developer attitude true talk game developer since modus operandi hurted game worth mentioning since probably ruin game even future expect game get better example new progression system wasnt ever mentioned years updates wouldve comunicated drastic changes game playerbase couldve given useful feedback changes going ruin game developer also habit staying silent answering questions clearing doubts sometimes may help players lot apparent dont care feedback want develop game way want okay course correct people bought game promise updates hope wouldve improve change abomination whole thing unprofessionalcheck reviews theyll surely describe problems game detail better mei think lesson avoiding feedback playerbase create game one likes case change direction one asked sure listening every complaint playerbase idiotic avoiding completely speaking avoiding dont buy game better spent somewhere else cutest game ever perfect game want explore listen beautiful music joy see characters animals much work put game definitely worth buying developer disappeared without word years really tells everything need know level support customer care expect buy game give developer money literally thousands indie developers work hard listen feedback support customers deserve money go find developer straight scammed everyone steam please allow refunds devs need work game hopefully fun fix fact language menu option non functional index number go negatives full release tell plenty state gamealso mind game also security flaw enables enabled people forcibly join gameno remote code execution yet tried fact windows support ridiculous heard rumours due dev simply liking windows thats true alone big red flag first hours great cool dungeons fun mechanics scaling difficulty horrible essentially leveling level every region combat gets quite repetitive ive seen alpha looks much better terms leveling scaling abilities buy unless like repetitive gameplay first hours good since lose gear move another biome game get different second time play reward get completing biome leveling often money start get slight stat boost could gotten rare gear use biomes ads experience repetitive would recommend playing liked alpha play alpha full release steered far away usual exploration gameplay first id say hours game blast second land completed start get little repetitive easily worth bucks hopefully updates come extend long game remains fun overall good game first hours awesome whole loosing gear changing zones xp skill tree randomly generated worlds etc defeats purpouse originally loved cubeworld alphai remember first character reached level still encountering plenty challenges lots fun friends changing zones like loosing everything end goal games means understand nothing look forward stop playingthe artifacts original way level sure id rather xp bar standard skill tree let us choose specialise choose fast boat skill points make artifacts uselful maybe add level artifact level knows could buff abilities better stamina less fall damage rescources harvesting bushes ores artifacts good idea misused arent rewarding friends tryharded hours star dungeon piece gear youll customize learn love let go forever artifact makes mount pet faster sure glad since havent even found reins next zone cant mount anymorewollay love game late revert loyal fans used loved much faith eventually turn tides pull mans sky us make great game rise first hours slog learned navigate region got first good items started really funthen time move onto new region fun dissipated didnt feel like progressing felt like starting isnt enough content game keep hooks items disappear marginal bonuses artifacts majority playtime dont apply characters actions anyway would call justifiable reward resetting equipmentthe progression system needs hefty overhaul feel rewarding considering buying cube world urge wait least changes made buy lot hours fun elsewherethe game amazing potential cannot recommend current state expected much full release still feels like title alpha stages development disappointing first game amazing everything going needed additional content make truly something beautiful version released everything wrong devs messed bad beyond im hoping update fix mess would suggest future buyers wait update purchasing first hour bit scary carefully avoid mobs far powerful got swing things pretty great game cathartic though sometimes bit difficult looking forward balance tweaks really cant complain first region fun may well make new character cross border gear resets real point everything againgame maybe content isnt worth first time heard cube world looking games like minecraft pc time literally potato even minecraft wasnt working saw cube world concept even better looking sadly wasnt released yetthe year parents got new pc could play minecraft friends another year later cube world alpha releasedbought day friends picroma excited really lot fun playing itbut time passed almost everything could explored everything could find alpha waitedi looked informations cube world every month since years passed like water desert discovered cube world beta would released steami happy long years finally one favourite games time would updated even birthday like birthday gift maybe best one ive ever receivedday friends lot fun playing thisday realize years life wasted looking informations game downgradedbut hopes high thought developers would continued working thisbut didnt actually disappeared im fucking middle school since wanted play game go college realized game never existed never exist know developers game husband wife sincerely want ask teach child maybe break every dream avoid delusions foundation game solid unlike people think region locking gear fine two changes think would vastly improve game would artifacts give combat related buffs lot potential roads go straight stat buffs interesting things could change build build lifesteal crit combo etc would make region feel unique would equip different artifacts youve earned compliment different dont region lock movement items boat glider etc instead provide buffs items find subsequent region buffs artifacts give essentiallythere things would make better well relatively simple would add much game game nice time play hours day sadly start way slow help given game definitely needs work nostalgic real cant wait better combat update region lock changes maybe helpful guides new players us played alpha never learned game definitely needs updates bug fixes besides still fun game play either alone friends although exploring areas collecting artifacts get repetitive especially since items dont carry regions besides cute little game play hours mods easily fix problems mentioned game delivers best visualy landscapes creatures far music love could better introduction new players game animations combat new ways fight mechanics abilitiy obtions instance interactive dialog important easier difficultyis worth kr yet potentional game fails proper meaningful progression artifacts get add noncombat stats would fine stats buff buffed insignificant amount lamp artifacts get light radius pathetic artifacts random buff discover know buff dungeon tedious discover gear making cant even try max one stats half near useless theres climbing diving riding sailing hangglide lantern light swimming climbing speed rarely ever useful every cliff ive come across easily climbable mainly use jump tech scale additionally climbing spikes make climbing speed useless diving less stamina used theres almost nothing underwater rarely treasures thats another stat gets upgrades dont need swim speed avoid water cost unless already boat boat youre swimming wasted stat lantern light lantern starts illuminating around basically nothing upgrade like get anywhere noticeable youre going need upgrades lantern actually helps see night good upgrades riding speed hangglider speed boat speed thats sort upgrade said upgrades pitiful amounts barely amount anything thus making review long winded way saying theres nothing really cubeworld aside maybe hours gameplay solo hit hour mark youll either tired stale progression constant resetting character starter level lie fun thing sure explore biome newish time thats really pushing biomes pretty awful explore youre stuck using flight masters get movement items like reinsboatsgliders make empty spaces points interest shorter game still shell could looks developer interest going walking away fine theyre quietly without even much letting us know sure game feels quite different alpha thats bad thing years work would strange game felt exact far enjoyed game good amount would recommend othersnote many people enjoying game due region lock go reddit get mod unlocks regions basically fixes game game gets lot flak actually think sucks single player game cooperation fun times fosters though multiplayer experience amazing finished first zone im even mad ill able given time region locking great way provide replay value thing id wish given boat mostly islandic region game flawed progression system discourages exploring world whole concept game presented first came innot new nonprogression system doesnt work actually real downgrade game back alpha new features dev introduced us via twitter feed arent gamedont buy developper never really communicated fan base regarding strong critiques beta truly realise mistake make cube world outstanding game supposed game good foundation years foundation shape considered release cant recommend anyone spending money game large span paths take game classes specializations means total ways treading lands cube world say put time dedication game pays really well experience amazing game dedication put even though people leave bad reviews look hours game versus people left good reviews playing game enjoy walking around seconds dying game truly fun explore thats point game explore region lock great feature dont want overpowered every single region forces start back work way different dungeons structures lore nice touch well something cool game feature allows learn region conclusion cube world good game game lot potential something great set back design decisions bring enjoyable gameplay grinding halt note yes play alpha therefore see developer going drastic changes changes could worked less intrusive intrusiveness features addressed likely would played much longer felt positive game overallfor context beginning game feels extremely slow enemies kill near instant travelling around foot extremely sluggish forgivable player starts game player starts obtain powerful gear tools faster travelling theyll feel strong sense pride accomplishment eventually obtain powerful godlike equipment effectively dominating enemy daring cross path biggest issue rears head player enters new biome conquerthe egregious change overall entering new biome players gear matter level may rendered next useless player could taken time obtain full set star gear downgraded gear worse basic star level gear would drop area combined fact player also lose tools assist travelling sends effectively right back beginning game things kept consumables gold pets crafting materials none however really used help get effective jump start new biome also keep effects artifacts previously obtained effects permanent upgrades players movement speed using certain tool light radius lantern increase negligible though motivate keep clearing biomes themwith mind big changes would make order system work much better far important dont completely neuter player gear entering new biome player rarely find gear work within adjacent biomes originally found theyre rare usually stars anyway simply good enough instead reduce number stars player gear entering adjacent biome would ensure player brought notch likely starting star gear grind gameplay screeching halt like beginning allow players quickly travel town new biome best place find initial quests begin powering maybe allow flightmasters let travel biomes main town straight away modest fee maybe friendly npcs walking around could point right direction always notifying town location first player yet discovered make artifact permanent boosts substantial give us option choose boost select similar skill points back alpha make increases get exponentially lower player dump boosts single stat example first boost riding could provide extra speed every point onwards capping speed less used skill swimming lantern could get much substantial percentage increase per level along higher cap much situationalanyways goes hour life hopefully developer sees main critique fixes glaring issues new system groundwork much potential hurts see tarnished rotten gameplay features game lot problems super different everyone expected bought alpha back happy version thisits certainly still possible enjoy game think flawed buggy fleshed dev uh problematic really would suggest stay awayjust play alpha game lot improve thats sure great base improved big improvements compared alpha version terrain generation way diverse balanced quests dungeons diverse meaningful even perfect new progression system better old one got equipped epic gear progression stopped make sense randomly generated lore well implemented pets tame bosses fighti get critics come people played game released alpha state paradigm game lot different opinion thats bad thing like new progression system think needs balanced thats allacquiring artifacts needs meaningful player regionlocked gear think work time ive played feel problem drop rates gear works one region big bosses probability drop kinds gearitemsarmorweaponswhateverlooking forward see comes next game game quite slow start get going pretty fun complete region lose gear kind disappointing hope changes artifacts new way leveling give qol boosts future still recommend game lot fun years ago release new version well game changed lot development good ideas game still feels mostly empty repetitiveyou start choosing one classes game warrior rogue ranger mage class unique weapon skills based weapon currently equipped game gives little choice moment maybe different weapons per class class also access two specializations moment mean unique active spellthe world split several regions biomes contain quests points interests start region gear work quests points interests get better gear process starts difficult become incredibly easy pieces equipmentnow thing every time go another region lose gear except rare pieces start process previously didthe goal game moment obtaining artifacts small passive upgrade small mount speed increase small swimming speed increase make level level useless moment get artifacts usually complete hardest challenge regionto find quests points interests automatically shown map speak npcs region indication whether tell something useful sometimes spend minutes town talking npcs nothingthere little variety quests points interest almost always matter biome kill rare enemy find item clear dungeon dungeons extremely similar makes quickly repetitivethe combat system quite boring enemies deadly way damage without dying hitting stunned likely able stun use specialization spell mean spend time running kiting mobs wait spell cool stun enemies damage repeatone biggest problem game far apart things often spend time walking nothing uncommon spend minutes moving next destinationwhat bit sad game currently progression system except artifacts small boring passive upgrades alpha version progression xp system regions set level needed match gear permanent game skill trees removed least nowcube world dream many people high expectation share dream understand amazing game could yet correctly incredibly difficult seems wollay troubles getting right formula seeing game changed lot past years seen twitter dont feel like game right fun alphato conclude wouldnt say cube world terrible game moment quite low content quickly find things real purpose game lot diversity content artifacts actually useful original upgrades game could fun longer simply casei would recommend buying game moment unless seen gameplay convinced going enjoy hours game changed lot since alpha however though progression different games new version continues gameplay biome plays almost like new game think addition music quests moved game fully realized world though game may lack wanted features skill trees basically thing removed alpha overall experience enjoyable play one enjoys exploration games personally appreciate work put game wolly past years high hopes future game reading blog long alpha even close dream game changed bad theres wider breadth flavorful activities take part alpha systems removed luckily game progression systems theres certainly discover cube world alpha player youre looking make numbies go glorious dopamine shot comingsome tutorializing missing prerelease version obscure key displays keybinds looked didnt really know skills theres fun discovering new cube world ticks game changed since alpha still really fun game play friends game issues starting like playing russian roulette game starting properly broken game multiplayer terrible broken cant chat friend using ingame chat different maps tell someone correct im wrong seems game abandoned really hoping game amazing dreams crushed game lost meaning sense progression shot say idea artifact leveling novel breath fresh air execution said mechanic hand leaves lot desired movement stat boost worthless grinding per region enough gear attempt dungeon feels really boring constrictive mod called cwtool id recommend downloading reddit removes region locking gear special items anyone interested makes game way bearable actually really fun friends though current state would avoid game really painful launch really hope game gets better game nothing wrong change yet fine onethe game still playable cool plus many things got added makes game alot location gui ui pets ranks making game pretty lively plus comes good timingsuch find legendary npc interactionsones questrecommentionnormal chat makes sound structuresand bet even didnt countyeah everyone getting sad skill tree removed im fine game depends heavely equipments sureno leveling time git actually gud make tactics like pro never use ce exp points lol game plenty potential updates keep coming help replay value artifact bonuses region lock enemy scaling ect feels unfinished pointless completing one zone im hoping updates keep coming would recommend buying game game potential even post alpha state issuestldr downfirst probably biggest problem imo spawning region mobs seem random levels place able kill mobs starting zone frustrating run like minutes find something actually without one shotted flying radishes isnt good designsecond fact hang gliderboat region locked game literally travelling find something locking methods faster exploration behind quest per region unbelievable third overall region lock would make sense form permanent reward better swim speed increased light radius level ups never felt meaningless seriously make items rare global items scale rarity tier item suddenly dont feel like im wasting timetldr bad couple major problems probably easily fixed mods somethingedit mod fixes problems game honestly loads potential think people stuck region lock cant look past see game alpha anymore people need stop comparing alpha think game could certainly use improvements right game perfectly playable honestly would recommend anyone wants game fun laughs friends course one people cant see past region lock idk dont buy game honestly game worth every penny paid game current state fun worth price tag game hasnt many lovable changes since alpha ill say like changes needs meaning like getting artifacts gives extra effects abilities power scaling artifacts also would like way use key items outside region think way fix would give region star rating get higher region star rating get bonuses effects key items say stamina cost effectiveness duration even power upgrade sorts think game current state fun needs little overhaulupdate love game concept cant support developer runs first sign criticism game current state pretty game gives direction isnt normally issue becomes issue spawn system youll spawn randomly set world may able damage monsters near spawn kill hits dying like times simply gave game straight trash belongs dumpster game simply fun highly recommend game purchased game downgrade compared six years ago want walk world filled emptiness game trust wollay deliver final product update game would rely moders one pretty sure going remain quiet run away money want something like cube world would recommend looking forward veloren insteadi want type shit got wrong leave like waited six years update realize fewer features available beforedisappointment game fantastic idea wish like alpha though meaning played really sorry really need change game cause gonna last long right hope dont take personally wollay good hope make right decision game lot fun times challenging needs lot work done progression loot still fun experience biggest problem upgrades get character mostly disappear hours region lock small upgrades character dont get stronger game shell former version game everything made cubeworld decent stripped away youre left half assed gamethe game spend time taking away progression awarding whoever thought region locking gear great idea delusional gear joke honestly doesnt sound appealing grinding actual progression artifacts knowledge reward movement based bonusesalpha version version buy friends play game actually really good really easy play new friends always go new area explore together youa realize isnt game alphab enjoy playing games lots friendsthen game worth buying interests game alright lacks alot core gameplay features replayabliltyoverall im feeling light game amazing believe watch streams youtube tired recent games basically hold hand way cube world isnt like huge fan legend zelda series cube world similar many aspects cube world learning curve sadly lot people cleaver enough figure still learning making basic guides soon peace game rpg roguelike dungeon crawler unlike alpha version version replayablility first didnt understand gear region locking played realized much enjoyable alpha versiontheres world bosses dungeon bosses quests monsters pets ride unending exploration much much game bad even good abandoned developer second time updates game cant recommend buying even kind game game broken impossible enjoy without mods mods actually fun game decent wollay abandoned social media game looks like games gonna stuck early access like godus miracle dev went invisible years comes back polishes game review likely changeedit people working modding game bid make better means excuse mr funcks disappearance sort fills void youre interested people modding game make better check cube world subreddit rnotwollaybutok see people tinkering game dogshit current statedont even think buying worth developer dipped game got released people didnt like one knows went even coming back game support game enjoyable fails live expectations im horribly bored hours compared version certainly fails deliver hypethe progression goes painfully impossible distastefully easy items determine skill level actual ability play unlike used version combat much enjoyable competitive played pvp servers countless hours consists clicking pressing r shift time time enjoy quests losing powerful items upon new area totally fine still craft decent quality items taken area without penalty dependent npcs progress makes exploration rather bland change pets power level nice freely switch pets without xp loss find basic yet important items game every new area frustrating hinders enjoyable gameplay items ex glider boat climbing shoes etc found per character glider used favorite tool explore world outplay enemies pvp sucks even found artifact improved speed marginal hardly tell lastly ive seen many people type agree amount time effort needed clear stage marginal improvement random specific thing unacceptable without type leveling system future updates ever one cube world die good timei hope game improved inexplicably still love game cannot good conscience recommend game flawed way doesnt explain anything happens make feel cheated still provides enjoyable experience development continues become absolutely fantastic game game flawed yesartefacts feel like satisfying reward hours exploration put regionthe balance classes barely present seriously try water mage tell reason play fire mage butthe core gameplay loop potentialthe gear based progression allows anyone hop join friend even random players need get gear go new region able play teamthe incentive explore whole region find gear gear used accross several regions next exploration faster also good prevents issue alpha level skimmed regions find place farm legendary weapons region worth playing actually nice visual guide reddit see optimize exploration smooth playwhat determine game really good upcoming updates new artefacts better ones balancing patches new classes specializations play comes game truly great game fun game fun game fun playeble lacks content think would smart move developers side open workshop mods community make game want game help developer get ideas add things workshopjust idea save gamerip cube world updates game fun landbound system doesnt mix well absence rewarding global progression would advise waiting couple weeks see devs handle postrelease youre playing alone aim multiplayer watch guides jump game fun opinion able play game hours getting bored even though way many people disagree believe worth buying game fun first region youve crossed another region resets gear grey quality items boat glider also gone regrind stuff another region youve crossedthere skill trees exp way level find artifacts artifacts doesnt even feel rewarding increases small stats swimming speed climbing speed hang gliding speed etcthe music great game fun confusing first time play recommend looking play startwhile game enjoyable gets grindy awhile complete first area thats really thing new areathe real fun seeing monuments biomes seeanyways worth play depends like grindy games plenty free timeif dont like either probably game youps relic system sucks could least increase base stats instead increasing random movement stat like switch back leveling system like alphapps barely recommended played hours friends lot fun friends solo much game fun dont like system easily download mods interneti like alot without mods game good come long way development lot fun especially lot friends qualms game zone ranked randomly difficulty instead spawning go harder gets along items tied zone youre feel like least key items like glider boat soul bound regardless zone great game certain mechanic choices wish werent making game harder inconvenient game worth money people play yes developer need change mechanics yes still play game regardless dealio mechanics yes game good combat system way hard game good game fun im enjoying time difficult recommend even motivate continue regionlocked equipment exists consistently feels like im punished progression wanting explore incredible world feels like im set back every step forwardthe game potential become one favourite games time however current state cannot even justify bucks pricetag think youll enjoy probably id wait sale big update game good could better also people seem say hard long grind dont think true far quite easy enjoyable friend game great lot potential wollay pioneered new system progression entire game took lot bravery think deserves respect inevitable lead lot negative reviews however think continue add content game slightly tangible endgoal work towards game perfecta great foundation hope continues build upon game great grind hoping still cube world like game even though gameplay tweaked lot read game buy odd game expect classic rpg want adress something elsei played alpha lot surprised beta wasnt near massive respect wollay breaks issues releases game proud game wants beeverybody realise passion project wollays let man make game shoot dont like change want everything set mind spoiled brati hope keep working wollay deserve game great perfect balance simplicity freedom tied together thing holding back lack depth progression however foundation progression apparent alpha whilst may seem like step back im convinced time wollay find perfect blendignore die hard alpha fans telling game trash dead wrong game amazing back got years ago region locking kinda ass dont see people bitching enjoy game game kinda fun equipment really need able transfer areas hard dungeon group friends got yellow weapon star rarity explore another area weapon stats white weapon star rarity really makes efforts feel like waste exploring harder difficulty areas like dungeon dont seem worth especially going new region completing game like groundhog day trump baby every time cross border back square one endgame items seek find increase exploration abilities oh grinded hours get artifact swimming speed game great egrigeous moment decide move next region following game years closely looking update could find huge chunk things wollay implemented game tweets missing game could beautiful gem suffers poor progression design game like groundhog day trump baby every time cross border back square one endgame items seek find increase exploration abilities oh grinded hours get artifact swimming speed game great egrigeous moment decide move next region following game years closely looking update could find huge chunk things wollay implemented game tweets missing game could beautiful gem suffers poor progression design game perfect anyway however engaging adventure explore also people dont mention fact gearing zone white legendary items fast therefore region lock bad opinioni enjoyed game time spent know might get boring later spending hours game worth every penny price game fun without xp system anymore dont feel like im progression lose stuff new zone everytime game used changed adventure elements added makes game good xp makes game something new clone games grind mobs lvl like game lot like alpha like whole way game worth running simulator trove better option style gamemy advice wait game free continue play game worth playing youve completed first biome game oddly addicting since theres much see maybe kind game lot problems address throughout reviewit promised alpha beta two completely different games bad similarities focus game exploration game make easy soon enter new regions lose mobility gear enemies mostly tough classes unbalanced lot sustain water mage struggle lot survive rogue feel like game gets walking circles thing game changing mechanics change regions quests often repeat dungeons pretty similar mean different regions unique characteristics theyre really something interesting enoughcube world potentil game looks feels unfinished even years development keep looking foward updates plan keep playing game hope change review soon game okay theres least hours content even region locking thingmodding made game lot better already definitely enjoyable worth money p game pretty boring start get becomes whole lot fun go another regionstill fun game good time killer game pretty good like grinding games free roam might hard start gets easier play game game set way foster exploration play get amazing stuff first zone move next basically starting completely overthe system stands far punishing explorer really rewards people visit new place beat death exhaust content moving oni hope changes developer extremely nonresponsive comes features game hes great bugfixes addressing issues like past week anyway zero interaction community aside thatthere many positive things exploring world absolutely awesome except progression system punishes far much wandering far wherever fly across huge sections world interesting zone gear knocked worst quality even difficult kill easiest enemiesif get game play experience system decide whether like people definitely simply notin opinion incredibly disheartening see wonderful gem tarnished shallow progression system hope changes really want gaming community experience unique fun game without feeling like work much game slightly different version yes good everything thought detail fact farm gear maps problem progression slow doesnt bad want everything made easy come forum cry like babiesif ask recommend game yes wollay xd game solid though honestly recommend grabbing mod make progressive leveling game keep entertained hours game still good im waiting skill progression ill happy doesnt seem much improvement alpha though slightly dissapointedi need skill tree game super fun ones get ball rolling soon ball starts rolling quickly stopswhen clear first zone hit wall progress tied zone tied character im trouble finding motivation continue playing first zone clearas game currently cannot recommend game game vastly different released alpha years ago want game turn away want open world voxel adventure game procedural quests cube world game game different alpha think changes great yes things kind frustrating like zone locked items think helps getting feel game creating base level rise overall really enjoy game huge fan alpha thats worth anything game isnt perfect different alpha released back lot alpha players got play beta reacted badly game saying wasnt remember wanted thats isnt game alpha progression revolved around experience levels grinding made feel powerful working hard choices restart new character never challenged thats love new cube world games system region locking resets lot progress go new areathese areas arent small lot fun exploring first zone rolling hills valleys done could felt powerful like alpha able fly land find secrets items collected next region ocean stretching horizon entering didnt feel like losing progress felt like new game could go whole adventure like great sequel im currently sixth region game first character started ive collected artifacts items make start bit better first region enjoy place adventure said game isnt perfect hard find new quests tied people talk sometimes left wandering find regions last locations regions less interesting others well could use unique features also quite features tweeted developer years never made game hope added soonoverall cube world different game alpha old version definitely fun new version stands well enough would recommend anyone looking zeldalike rpg experience try game isnt perfect progression needs reworking starting little difficult daunting isnt much guide tell start things unfortunately lot people seem much nostalgia alpha version week release introduced best friend cube world realized progression system broken curve infinitely generated worlds version drastically changed progression system much untested polished slightly world much interesting shrines life better since act fast travel destinations villages cool theming npcs tell important stuff give quests sure go try asking around dungeons little nicer especially difficulty color coding dungeon maps artifact gear based progression isnt bad thing destiny works fine problem finding good way implement cube world lacking unfortunately much gameplay relies moment drastically shows review tells alpha better consider might affected nostalgia wasi recommend game want see live game improving time much mans sky cannot recommend game current state try update time game lost attractiveness back multiyearlong alpha phase yes prepurchased game somewhen sense progress achievement one got game leveling finding better better items simply destroyed implementation complete reset every time player crosses new zone previously mentioned negatively impact sense longterm achievement also isolates biome one another previously seemed connected crossing border two biomes meant change mobs style etc like pressing start new game button thus world feels incredibly smallwhat furthermore adds sense achievement missing completing zones primary quest goals awards small neglectable stats upgrades doesnt make appealing creates much incentive players keep playingsadly developers isolated approach coding game resulted game seems lost soul possessed early life cycle attracted many people game major mechanic changes introduced cannot recommend spending money game pretty fun play played steam think developers take time access players might like give choice choosing systems something everyone enjoy everything though like cube world thing huge fan newer area switch systems loss power going section mean could simply release plugin disable players like system however need give lower rating since developers get scared handle players go trolling raging changes ever want chat wolffram please feel free hit game different alpha doesnt mean bad game pros cons version game fun bring content constantly genuinely try game hard get used im sure good time game removed progression instead fixing scalling enemies increase playtime exploring new areas joke since lose almost progress lasting buffs artifacts joke game kind plays like roguelike every time enter new area start scratch except get artifacts upgrade character permanently fun start new world try see quickly complete areas quests one games lots different classes worth playing game cycle least every class sometimes even changing weapon huge effect gameplay havent tried multiplayer yet looks promising dont play water mage way makes game waaay easy game lacks genuine content feels empty meaningless quests dont feel rewarding worthwhile ive played game steam release honestly doesnt feel like impressive step game looked cool got swagger souls fitz turned trash game may different people expected however reason say game necessarily bad never assume alpha stages game anything similar end result looks like far goes game certainly needs work especially gpu driven era gaming find way incorporate make run smoother easier worth anything personally enjoy game eventually came know youre progress really fast rpg elements game enhanced lot decent cpu definitely worth trying sort game hey problem right game needs lot work still game currently still lot fun game needs improvement rather review bombing game creating scenario developer feels like lost instead create articulate valid criticism still enjoying whats wollay able rationally develop instead deal internets wraith overreacted something minor like internet always game needs one minor change go completely pointless past first hours worth playing much longer periodcollecting artifacts already generates levels character absolutely bearing anything simply convert level talent point build talent tree basic abilities buffs fix problems people regionlocked progressionlist permanent unlocks key item normally perregion original spawns would replaced item gold drop upgrades key items gliderboatclimbing speed hidden item find radius etc automatic reveals points interest instead manually talking random npcs increased droprate increased item chance items work adjacent zones longer dodge roll double jump etclistthe current progression path hours area youre forced reset zero new area increase abilities matter many areas complete talent tree described would similar experience first couple areas beyond significant speed automation improvements would radically change goals zone fast complete even feeling characterthe game would eventually need manner endgame challenge really utilizes upgrades genuinely isnt necessary till well launch talent tree alone additions content would allow satisfying experience collecting artifacts possibly even repeated across character classes playersa system like blatantly obvious simple implement reason hasnt done stubbornness oddly new progression path implemented months ago years development dev needs get asap drop everything else add talents youll see game tanked reception otherwise game needs serious work progression long term goalsother game still fun hours new questzone system pretty niceif game stays state safe say old version better game needs work overall think pretty solid foundation region locking biggest thing needs go seriously adjusted tutorial would welcome variety better usefulness artifacts different enemy mechanics looking forward seeing game goes coming yearsupdate gave plenty time see update would release hasnt game abandoned dev took money ran changing review thumbs game needs work enjoy main issues high commitment low reward said commitment form search loot every time enter new zone ground im favour new system gear doesnt become redundant outside home region instead falling power levels becoming useless biomes away biome originadditionally think would benefit game bring back xp system instead make focus base stats health attack strength etc artifact system remains place stats currently controls albeit slightly higher reward per artifact finally regards progression difficulty instead white yellow system universal difficulty scale difficulty could perhaps simply increase new region explored player enemies getting overall buffs health damage along player eventually end players reaching health thousands fighting enemies health thousands game lot room improvement still reasonably enjoyable get past growing phase adapting unorthodox game design region locked loot based progression personally cannot wait see else wollay decides add game really good anymore man wollay needs work things want like want recommend game cant things alpha years ago straight removed disappointing say least game right might little bad alpha still better wish didnt restart every time go new location hope developer tries make game like alpha version doesnt ill still play wait mods something believe game least playable dont like grinding game definitely dont play game seems complicated first settled first region youll problem beating next one first theres tutorial kind difficult manage overall fun big world right really awesome much new feature game simply feels empty lot people emphasized questionable design choicesafter get gear game feels like breeze soon leave region boats mounts pretty much uselessthis feels lot like early access game shame game somehow went backwards development since alpha somehow managed spend years development time make game strictly worse buying game like buying scam dont game starts slow move forward fun doesnt stop game still feels lacking like tech demo wouldnt recommend buying big updates game still looks pretty honestly cant see sinking anymore hours beautiful visuals variety choices character creator generic music killing enemies feels pointless despite challenging youll find running circles youre geared everything game doesnt tool tips prompts tell play iti personally felt less way alpha didnt expect release like thiscant recommend sadly game takes sometime good frank still havent reached although give lot cant handle enemieson scale id give great game although quite challenging would dive people away game took every aspect fun xp skill trees ext replaced crap downright punishes trying explore gear useless unless get gear takes lot unfun grinding cases need regions get said good stuff ed even gear ive heard made far yet degrade like gear get far area acquired itgrinding fun ends getting one shot next region whats point theres also relics carry world replaced leveling xp system place oh boy cant wait work region amount increased swimming speed slightly faster gliding speed game worth six years development somehow regressed quality end day still nothing barebones experience cause get enough content see lot repetition game used amazing especially alpha great qualities alpha arent anymore im hoping game continue grow change review basically feels like waste time progression almost non existant machanics work game better years ago really way game better alpha wouldnt mind changes wasnt region lock dont mind skill tree gone entire map showing region lock got game better alpha game fine hours wont load crashes everytime game fun little got repetitive game great huge update came turned shitty game game great alpha exp system hoping brings back game looks great great potentiali sure shape fantastic game better state first released years ago progression grindy extremely repetitive combat cryptic unbalanced hell gear rewards general begin get boring faster rpgs despite focus new system cool aesthetic good amount customization beautiful map system outright good game point tldr wait come early access make decision game much better alpha version unlike full release game actual sense progress procedural world generation progressive increases difficulty got world center cube world really isnt worth getting full price wait sale even make sure really want cause theres pretty good chance youll get bored within hours playtime game fun promising came back super interesting really enjoyed played lot regardless fact wasnt much direction mostly sandbox time thought going go somewhere sadly game took different turn hoped would enemy placement started become odd frequent leading immediately frustrated enemy grouping difficult also lazy looking considering went areas would see ogre would difficult much eventually usually rare drop seeing grouped together along lot sort mini boss enemies grouped large numbers high levels early feel like made every enemy become easy forget compared progression became less character random gear got also biggest fan like gear interesting abilities differences nothing game really sort unique stat go outside damage game like diablo factors like ability improve damage type give dexterity necessary stat things make grinding slight improvements interesting due needing see factors deciding upgrade downgrade cube world doesnt yet focus switched way heavily gear progression themes game dont fit place anymore mention worlds longer randomly generated world eventually repeats way feel also another regression sadly cannot recommend cube world state dont know improved future cant play game pretty shit tried mods still pretty shit less shit guess thats enough still shit tho game buggy friendly new players starting monsters around spawn area stars would one shot also took long time figure get friends location whenever friend joined server joined server would away long time finally figured could use fast travel get game went completely new direction threw everyone actually like change new style progression although artifacts havent changed buffed believe need work would reccomend game anyone everyone standard rpg think botw kinda games regionbased progression bandaid fix deeper issues game longevity balance game whitegreenbluepurpleyellow rarity system player gear enemies enemies one two rarities almost unkillable unless use cheese tactics youre lucky receive weapon drop become pathetically easy rarity tiers raise stats around double makes fights outside gear rarity either easy difficult get yellow weapon enemies region trivializedthis without mentioning stuck one biome leave may well created new character gear made useless goal collect artefacts permanent upgrades give miniscule buffs lamp radius swim speed impossible widescale adventure spanning multiple zones due gear resets done one zone effectively completed game go motions try drops tier recollect basic travel options like boat gliderthe game broken core fundamental systems gear scaling progression stifling ability really explore feel like theres permanence growth gameplay isnt bad really like artistic style game fun friendsthe thing holding back recommending game lackluster leveling region lock current moment feels like large yet shallow lake games good current state gear system little weird like game overall goal game bland real main story game driven exploration survival features believe adding story line andor main bosses greatly improve game top basic leveling system improves stats character granddaddy hyped eagerly waited games absolutely worth waitwollay proud hes createdvery accessible content sense discovery littered every corner gamethe game rewarding keep getting better class picked punish use safer strategies play gamebecause open world game wrong way play wanna cheese high level boss go aheadthe open endedness way wraps together creates unique experience best explained trying yourselfive loved since start love see game evolveit sparks feeling ive felt last time decade ago feeling got first played awesome games like ratchet clank crash bandicoot kingdom hearts spyro dragon missed feeling much love play cube world spark feeling every time fire upthanks wollay never repay amount joy brings please leave comment common occurance id love hear hour half put well worth year wait fun lot funnier playing friends would also want see game get updates keep fresh lack meaningful progression via artifact system resetting gear strength regions doesnt appeal ive tried enjoy game give new systems chance isnt something enjoyfor isnt enough justify purchase right hadnt backed alpha many years ago wouldnt even consider buying latest update like hitler even hitler cared germany something leveling system changed still much fun color codes stars enemies heads makes soooo much easier fight truly fun game worthwhile main draw cube world much encourages exploration unlike procedurally generated open world games end bolted one part map biomes varied set buildings dungeons fauna even nothing interest around environment sufficethe core gameplay solid combat fluid satisfying classes feels unique adding good amount strategy playing group good way freshen game using one class long time inbetween large variety ways travel drowning tedium getting around quests however tend samey kill albeit different reasonthe progression cube world turns lot people power tied gear gear tied region well almost rare gear passed closeby regions give leg artifacts follow everywhere provide small exploration based buffs personally see testing new concept way solve problem infinite world tied character finite goal mindoverall great game coupled confusing experimental system cube world would highly benefited tutorial explains systems allows earn basic gear get starting difficultly still worth playing even youre thrilled region locking definitely get moneys worth even clear regions trying new class setting game playtime time read review recommend new mechanics pretty fun enjoy running around friends beating monsters shame people went positive negative thoughts span like day really wish people might see try compare much alpha though probably never happen since people make mind internet refuse change new progression pretty wack look review explanation core game still really fun honestly wollay gives game quick update allow people keep gear changes artifacts impactful main issue mostly solved also make base run speed faster allow us fast travel previously found area interest instead shrines leave positive review want people experience least first main area game want wollay keep working calling wollay lazy scammer doesnt help anybody let wollay hear fair criticism lets let man iron problems kill remember even month ago fate game unknown time writing less week since release trust least new year current issues worked better solid game hands please buy cube world least worth asking price new region based system really bad reason buy craft good gear basically lose soon completed region lot good things earlier versions removed teased features implemented feels like huge downgrade new region lock game progression system kind killed fun game hopefully theres way patch feature game lot fun back alpha new system different honestly like better back alpha game grindfest kill monsters level really whole game release actual game zone exists isolation next isnt bad thing uevery new region supposed treated entirely new gameu gear find artifacts arent supposed huge effect definitely recommend multiplayer easy pickup play hoursi miss old ocean biomes though og cube world better think updates good old cube world better old leveling system alpha stripped steam version gear get region locked even years ago game almost perfect could released steam one would complainedthe thing could done time add alpha update classic mode game developer stuck new system hundreds hours alpha ran server current steam version appeal meuntil version mechanics get changed back old way cannot recommend game current state ole bait switchthis good walking sim good thing game realize exciting watching paint dry real issues game adding overwatchish skills left click right click place multiple skills region locking things like hanggliders saddles fact gear becomes useless every time enter new regioneverything else pretty great quests dungeons multiplayer love wish didnt change things werent problem original cube world alpha excellent game fun gameplay great potential majority negative reviews like game changed drastically changed directionscube world beta completely reworked progression system gear resets regions activities within region less previous region makes rather repetitive gameplay loop one enjoy everyone believe get moneys worth game aware youre purchasing set expectations accordingly original alpha back much potential rewarded explorationthe progression fun brokenthe towns variety purposethe world interesting resources fairly easy come byfast forward thing stayed broken progression system rest turned something much worsei really wanted get back game much love hope years ago years development gave us unsalvageable mess original cube world fun loved playing watching cube world game cube world graphics abilities completely new loved old system monsters scaled always better gear forcing reset every new zone deal breaker overall gameplay elements good region locking makes really difficult play much relics earn dont anything useful never buff main stats overall id give game current state people mad game obviously havent played enough figure progress game extremely fun get party together take new region fantastic game perfect example careful wish possitivesthis game ton potential stands right unfinnished product game starts without giving guidance ever theres use speaking npcs since wont explain anything anywayonce youve figured get started however pretty enjoyable progressing isnt badthe negativesbut dont dare think exploring walk new area lose progress exception pets pet foods potionsfoods minor movement stats completely unrelated combat map completely uncovered therefore gives excitement exploring new landsnot mention theres xp skill tree fill feeling progression theres progression meter show much area youve completedon top creator egocentric wont take critique community form feedback would require change wont reply anyone anything game paranoid hire team assist work mention completely left ignored alpha community six whole yearsas much want game good right really baddont spend money save cash time presteam version still better progression completely destroyed rpg never gain sense power control world within game progression system alpha much better removing character leveling skill tree system big mistake system replaces annoying character progression stats based items find loose access items leave region found every time go exploring main point game restart square one despite great additions game like new buildings enemies fast travel progression system killed funif could level character unlock skills like alpha game would blast especially multiplayer im finding enjoyable sad waited years release hope developer changes back progression system nonexistent gear region locked unless get rare drop case doesnt reset cross neighboring regions incentive explore beautiful world one strong points game leveling nonfactor levels determined artifacts collect around world give tiniest boost single non combat stat time ultimately leads zero overall progression endgame content players share seed every region repetitive activities combat pointless exp skill tree gone gear may get random drop becomes pointless second leave region gear upgrades alpha also gone crafting recipes transportationexploration gear things artifacts effect also region locked need unlocked upon entering new region incentive keep playing beat region current state arguably less alpha cant recommend progression system motivating enough enough content years developmentafter first regions youve seen everything progression system sadly terrible hope gets changed game would pretty ok better system progression system might everyones liking game definitely doesnt hold hand random world truly beautiful intriguing spots location locked progression makes zone like separate game little bonuses carry almost like rogue like figure get past wall start really enjoy time find quite unique would definitely recommend prospect official response wollay exiting entire game reason reviews mixed right alpha players liked game easier dont like region locking make cant progress extremely fast finishing one region getting strong enough fight anything wollay removed level scaling enemies game would boring fast kept way though skill tree sad loss also hoping specializations classes like mage elements different warrior skill trees skill tree removed cant happen mods would nice pretty much entirely different game alpha thats expected long time since release alpha enjoyed alpha full release new experience hoping honestly got sick old leveling system whole power thing think game would get really good played long enough found cool things make interesting cheesing boss get good gear finish region ups downs still great game would recommend buying arent pumped wait sale recent update unfortunately missed mark loved alpha purchased years ago complete radio silence years far know ever since update came doesnt help either game promise saw potential game past still remain hopeful future futurefor cant recommend buying game still state region locking mechanics relic hunt gets old quick region lock annoying would recommend dont know spent hours getting good eq nothing get alpha made mobs harder made sense idk theory thing reality wrong feels like ive achieved region nothing pointless pisses love game come g hope u dont limbo another addressing little thing literally one thing atleast long u keep playing one region fun hell main fun seeing new bosses new places region lock makes difficult explore lack levels makes grinding fun enemies fighti still remember alpha cube world tons fun friends nownot anymore play mod comes changes old playstyle region locking sucks coop decent total playtime game hours finished first area got bored start increase climbing speed increases base stats ie attack hp mp resistance armour exploration stats option adding meaningful stats well random exploration stats waited years inferior product alpha might get better willing change review im holding breath another years removal transport items boat glider reign pet every region border hurts even last remaining progression system left game speed boosts items artifactsthe lack meaningful communication wollay pixxie another issue bad cant recommend steam release downgrade loved back day cube world pretty sad thing cube world game doesnt progression thing game progression items really hard find takes hours get artifact boosts get artifacts arent worth time effort think process like fun interesting play style sort scaling system towards game example get first artifact double click artifact stats get boosted next region enemies would little harder play way get stronger stronger progress regions fun similar system implemented game highly suggest dont buy game current state thing think game good ideas could become good interesting gamebut current moment huge step beta lacking actual good fucking gameplay best thing could happen every poor soul bought piece crap game get refund update great know critical gonna drive wollay away community years im sorry update bad originally cube world awesome game heavy focus exploration beta dev gutted way progression worked xp levels skill tree replaced new system find gear gear determines level whenever leave current biome gear found biome disabled start completely actively discourages exploring instead forcing spend hours biome complete moving change opinion made game completely unenjoyable play way game built makes little difference hour character hour character respect time spends hours getting gear opening exciting chests ripped away due horrible disrespectful progression system literally trys motivate continue playing punishing playing sorry thats fair get movement speed increase completing zone thing seconds faster yay shaved seconds hour zone clearing time totally worth lets throw away gear customization square onei played even half finished alpha many hours far better wollay redeemable feature first play though first zoneyour money better spent elsewhere unless fixes trash progression system way progress crap legendary items didnt want start quit whole purpose legendary item extremely difficult obtain obtain well keep journey instead get almost free get taste overpowered want explore instatly became level thug like mafia publicity trailers make artifacts affect stats runningclimbing swimming want keep item bound system dont make legendaries easy zone make hard get permament item doesnt change dont discourage people exploringinstead region locking make region base level way know going level gear travel something else dont reset progress players world generation awesome areas look feel unique dont get boring dungeon generation great keeps one feeling fresh even youve seen main structure world absolutely feels alive friendly animals enemies roaming npcs thing lot different regional biomes one looks totally different changes way get around welltraversing world fantastic class different mobility options like sprinting teleporting dashing hanggliding never fun especially great views see climbing free climb surface long enough stamina obtain item help swimming boats lakes rivers oceans mount pet even running speed many respawn points unlock also serve fast travel points flight master towns let quickly reach friends pay visit undiscovered areasthe way game works world broken many regions completing one area several hours moving onto next gears power carrying means reentering core loop starting fresh gaining power time complete quests fight enemies close overall power level sense game feels like roguelite complete main game start albeit brand new world generation biome also gain permanent power form artifacts minor noncombat stat boosts coins crafting materials occasional gear gear retains power nearby regions keeps game stagnating youve finished initial power curve region actually feel like new challenge get experience satisfying power curve however system may sit well every player enjoy starting find frustrated whenever must move new regiontalking npcs towns throughout world reveal whats going region showing quests difficulty completing quests get better gear unlock things world better items shops higher level crafting getting rid roadblocks lot quests long procedurally generated dungeons tons enemies big boss permanent rewardunfortunately artifacts act permanent upgrades unreasonably minor swimming speed acceptable reward hours playtime idea great actual upgrades need better though hopefully sort improvement otherwise looking modders fix systemcombat bit depth originally gave credit class subclass plays combat differently different abilities weapons strategies different weapon types change main alternate attack methods go many throughout region core combat dealing damage stunning empowered attack deal damage time heal craft elixirs give stat boosts struggling enemies vary attacks ranged telegraphed charge abilities dash etc humanoid enemies classes difficulty way playing melee classes easy deal mages absolute nightmare rollingdodging avoid certain attacks combat falls flat definitely core enemy ai enemies run straight line hit range use attack makes kiting important stronger enemies fast faster however feels bit lame real depth also many large bosses sponges huge health pools slowly whittle tamecollect pets pet food find randomly scale dont need micromanagement used mounts tank damagedeal damage battles much say besides collecting fun completionist task matching gamemany systems game set cooperative gameplay succeed ive got say coop pretty well done want play friend invite join instantly together world absolutely loading games may make new character play friend starting game dont enter new region start level playing field reach friend need go town flight master bring youre done playing coop go back region working feels great biggest problems coop following team hud meaning difficult see players health problem especially healers also difficult times tell another player died quest markers shared dont talk npcs may missing quest markers isnt huge deal annoying planning go next regardless good game coopthe graphics good stylized simple works fancy shaders metals gold pleasing look map system great pleasure browse also runs incredibly well compared games smooth visible chunk loading ala minecraft environment beautiful unfortunately always consistent effects jarring ugly playing mage means staring ugly block tornado using basic attack seeing time bombs explode one disappointing ways ever seen gamethe audio probably least favorite part game like sound effects many combat sounds feel impactful footsteps loud unpleasant going water feels like left faucet running music better several tracks sound like old midi files fortunately lot songs good lot many different situations biomes said audio game easily moddable replace wavogg files redeemed aspect mewollay good communication difficult tell future holds cube world lot things love lot things dont think belong hopes developers modders address things potential game insane properly supported see playing years game passion project two people make game want even majority players may wantin conclusion game everyone enjoy design one best exploration games world completely ready forgive wollay years radio silence seemed like took money ran longest time original game simple easy hop good time new version puzzle figure completely devoid feeling progression satisfaction honestly tacked couple bits extra content alpha years ago people wouldve eaten enjoyed instead somehow managed spend years making game much less enjoyable back astounding lack judgement release state knowing much meant peopletheres excuse id say dont refund yet wait update fix dont another years patience left lot people giving game bad review things significantly changed alpha build released years ago id like give bit different perspectivei also played love alpha trying new version definitely jarring played long enough learn new mechanics got settled back found game still fun probably still better alphapretty much negative reviews revolve around xp changes people dont like rather miss simplified gain xp level mechanics see games power version changed levels gearing also revolves around regions meaning power doesnt transfer regions accomplishes things primarily longer way outscale even strongest enemies possible certain point alpha concrete system replayability moving new regions completed one currently change actually makes game lot fun least dont looming sense game becoming triviali think people really giving game fair due hope people like game originally least give shot still really like aspects game love stands cant recommend cube world become painful experience playcube world best youre moving around quickly exploring new areas findingfighting new things currently decent enough albeit slow dont find mobility items youre one zone quickly turns awful go new zoneprosgreat music combat still decent class imbalance still totally thing classes feel similar alpha couple added abilities thats nice added bits lore neat nice see quests treasure neat new things wildconsclass balance isnt great especially subclasses friends found frustratingstatic world definitely think game better changeable world seed rather static worldoh boy go back alpha wed go really long glider trips zones looking unique different zones explore ones right us seemed uninteresting repetitive regionlocked gear along regionlocked mobility items makes less impossibleregion locked gear every time leave zone gear youve received immediately reduced absolute trash grey standard rpg rarity colours apply stats unless piece gear keeps power within certain set zones time mostly clearing one zone managed get single piece gear really really bad implementation imo gear dropped rarities default radius zones got region locking wouldnt nearly horrifying situation new zone gear makes absolutely useless regionlocked mobility items boat glider mount reins climbing shoes region locked group found climbing shoes us pretty thorough exploring whole zone play time single zone didnt find boatglider cube world needs gliderboat zones theres absolute ton walking otherwise cant reliably find hints absolute key items top moment leave zone items stop working game thrives exploration absolutely harshly punishes single handedly worst part game even painful regionlocked gear utility items harp whistle treasure spirit etc vanish zone isnt big deal issue like losing gear mobility isthe progression carries regions artifacts artifacts give small boosts secondary stats lantern aoe glider speed underwater breathing time etc suffer diminishing returns nothing really makes powerful makes things less hasslesome bugs etc gameplay obvious class bugs stability issues feels like game maybe barely tested patches coming huge issuein conclusion cant recommend game modern state mechanics arent less fun alpha genuinely think create ultimately frustrating unenjoyable experience alpha access go back play instead want everything addedchanged beta reverted core components definitely need either removed heavily revamped make game enjoyable punishing players continuing play isnt really great move many aspects cube world absolutely love gorgeous world generation landscapes awesome character modelsdifferent races unique enemiesbosses list goes spent many enjoyable hours playing alpha edition game looked forward next game far beta looks runs well primary reason negative review change alpha beta change complete removal xp level system character enemies items regions skill trees etc could maybe get past sort real combat based character progression lack implementation region locked items upon entering new biomeregion lose statslose item gear boats hang gliders etc exception items allow use items extra regions ultimately becoming useless travelling far distances new lands believe game still potential really think wollay pixie done fantastic job creating world however someone enjoyed old progression system excited footage posted showing levels item levels enemy levels region levels etc suggestion would keep current beta mechanics type quickplay mode would fun short sessions friends reimplement old mechanics character level skill trees enemy levels item levels varying rarity region levels get higher travel etc etc etc rpg mode many others would much rather play latter mechanics willing change review positive something like implemented many fundamental issues games design philosophy modders already attempting fix itwould recommend buying game state absolutely notwill say game real future potentially due way developer made game everyone loved something completely different without listening feedback community created reason believe developer listen feedback whatsoeverits sad games alpha inspired many games finally release one mediocre games marketit things right beautiful game bogged stupid decisions made development could bit progression mix gameplay gear huntstill fun game though lot irritation dislike cube world ever since beta released played beta week put around hours playing far game flaws creator wollay amazing game potential great even thoroughly enjoying feel free explore want play right win battle want even underpowered gear game presents really nice challenge much reason play game leave area everything lost gear reset nothing artifacts get area give small miniscule bonuses help basically nothing would buy game great game hidden inside cube world progress since beta years back great also made steps back honestly much love cube world little hate cant get behind wollay treated community dont think anyone deserves level hate anger hes getting understand coming game something special huge potential wollay abandoned fans years treating us like annoying pests getting way project never wanted deal public could never released game responsibility listen engage community game strayed wildly course nothing like promised region locked gear terrible idea exploration game wollay would never made mistake listening fans instead running away form years cube world community deserve better theres nothing justify making us wait half decade really hope game saved improved time like mans sky really really want love main story real system progression may equip character armor weapons effective region acquired requires craft find new equipment region explore may also find transportation form hang gliders boats reins pet however also usable region found form progression present game artifacts provide bonus small noticeable entering new region similar restarting game new character neutral option steam could review wouldcube world great example never giving hope six years come back sun light sadly kinda wish stayed shadowsif like minecraft lego worlds young child would recommend picking sure wait go sell like engrossing story interesting characters complex toon builds choices truly matter recommend looking else point anything cube worldyou dont get anything killing mobs dont motivation kill mobs dont kill mobs motivation farm good gear without need good gear motivation explore places could find good gearcube world markets exploration rpg really want explore world picking ranger class sneaking world undetectedmonsters gear become completely obsolete isnt greatthe game chooses progression via gear progression via experience completely fine way implemented doesnt make sense chooses restrict scaling player instead scaling game around player sounds great multiplayer join friends regardless playtime takes away every aspect reward systemi absolutely loved concept alpha would still love current game concept sadly isnt system doesnt feel like part complete game potential fun yet isnt much good game seems six years less content hopefully fixed flaws seem fundamental dont much hope reason scratch good things alpha things shown tweets today game currently completely unbalanced lacks clear objective lore seems thought day quests repetitive since region forces reward get back game took changed region feels like punishment happened absolute worst theres zero contact whatsoever developer community seems like hes blatantly ignoring playerbase feels insulting theres lot fun exploring cube world fighting collecting pet taming havent even scratched multiplayer yet blastso far definite issues need ironed many extremely online people mentioning feel region locking mechanic novel idea scaling game order make multiplayer fun scaling usually employed games order keep players power levels close together ways amount damage done scaled game based level scale equipment alone without making numbers neigh meaningless definite task think interesting way solve problem novel idea things need taken consideration dont feel fully considered aside would still heartily recommend cube world anyone keep good work wollay pixxie theres lot love core systems flawed ton potential hope game gets fixed future theres mod released least lets keep gear going neighboring zones maybe im blinded nostalgia ive ton fun playing think hate big overblown band wagon didnt deal zone problem everyone love way classes reworked combat fluid fun things actually new strategies emergent gameplay mage especially far fav well warrior check gamersworth moral reasons alone bought got alpha pirate jokes website theres leveling system game grinding supplies even attempt upgrade stuff slow slow slow slow concept game great execution horrible fix might play wont touching game theres point playing game anymorethis game exploring map getting better loot getting powerful time however features contributed alpha removedas said point game exploring map game punishes exploring removing progress making items either weakened flatout removed inventory go far end switching regions skill tree levels system also removed taking away fun gameive played games alpha hundreds hours still played open mind really wish game good tried convincing good game isnt fact developer vanished game released isnt giving players hopes might fix things theres much say hasnt already said ad nauseumthe game good foundation needs lot work core gameplay changed completely made fun years ago alpha launched website game many features listed come like guilds advanced skill tree pets could evolve none version theres stuff alpha straight removedcoupling disappointing gameplay experience feels like never ending repetitive loop nothing ever changes combat exploration otherwise bewildering progression system takes away gear score soon enter new zone isnt worst thing world artifacts hunt increase levels dont really provide enough reward continue searching oh yeah transportation items disappear enter new region find punishes exploring outside regionthere used diving water creatures dungeons ocean thats removed used dungeons general alpha far fewer nowand way game managed years always felt like wollay developer took money ran didnt communicate happening game course years hed post twitter little bit progress showed really neat things working little work made gameso like base game feel like idea could expanded ultimately still feels like base early access game years really things changed fundamental gameplay design nothing really feels like added stuff feels like taken away ultimately things different newi criticize game would like succeed watching game years first played years ago feeling much changeit isnt worth current state things change review edited reflect simply worth hope game develops thing promised years ago cannot review game might become review game theres really progression game fun play get items back region gets boring especially since hang glider boat reins region locked exploration takes lot longer enter new region gameplay pretty fun combat feels good enemies wizards balanced fun fight world big interesting explore ability customize weapons great changes could become even fun alpha enjoyed much years ago theres nothing inside wide game boring lacking much potential promised shown got hope ups game future theres nothing substance six years development even small team real mystery thinking given cube world gives little work start may well development process reflected gameplay meagre offerings start finishaesthetically game looks theres new mobs items isnt six years worth work anything game play regressed rewarding dont mind challenge figure mechanics experimentation isnt itid recommend avoiding hopefully theres gameplay overhaul future changed game simply worth spending time like quests redo reseting character traveling game levels aritifacts skill tree actually quite

swimming speed latern ligh radius increase need year get everything maxedwhich game gets repetitve hour buy game really downgrade alpha version game letdown previous version nonetheless still great fun game game ive waited ever worth wait awesome game looks great game years hiding darkness given whole new light graciously brought us wollay pixxie games changes served better expectation things could use touching much play beta far found fun every corner rate voxel adventure rpg game stars complaint would current biome ocean biome definetly changed alpha versions able cruise within minutes makes kinda boring time recommend sort underwater temple would require player get stamina usage diving artifacts introduction underwater breathing potions anything general would make ocean biome feel oceany island resort least bring back underwater monsters mean ones would spawn underwater blowfish land overall game earned right called great anticipated game game exploration fundamental least like alphanow brand new progression system kills good feelings first region nice funny second one bit boring get everything third one play gone gliderthis total failurelucky still alpha installed amazing game played around years beta alpha idk im back playing amazing love new updates keep work feels like really solid early access title since doesnt claim early access im worried game ever going game absolutely flaws give game negative review would outright wrong beta introduces new style gameplay suited everyone personally lot fun alpha would get endgame would peaked keep one shotting enemies soft reset region going stage progression time dont see punishment exploring granted artifacts seek region need kind revamp even fun hopefully thats something future game alpha two different games personally liked alphas gameplay mechanics willing give try first areas quite entertaining gameplay doesnt much longevity didnt motivation basically start scratch every areagot game release date even weeks later coopmultiplayer unplayable maybe someday ill give chance see anythings changed cant recommend buying game current state definitely full price disappointing long development time promising alpha game brings sadness sad please help buy game game changed dramatically since released didnt feel like better id continue waiting game could good kept beta puts world instructions everything way stronger hard progress barley find new good weapons theres nothing explore game couldve good really hope fix game would rate game definitely shown lot potential far little exposed core game polished gameplay mechanics integrated hit miss im going list artifacts lack skill tree slow progression since reviewers going go way indepth sunk couple hours learn game try enjoy current state cannot im still going follow though hope updates help game unlock potential im giving negative review may change timehopefully wollay compromise satisfying community intentions game game hold hand early game super rough first starting xp system feel fits super odd rpg got maxed hours used gear tranfers connecting lands max another biome able snow ball would kill game explore depend villages adventures map knowledge buffs biome grindy forces explorization game lot promise alpha practically abandonware developer cut run game twice back would happy game removed steam frankly modders people keeping game alive working thanks game alot love put simple change wasnt communicated addressed fanbase ruined many peopledo buy let developer learn lesson communication key move game still much potential got excited started playing cube world early alpha days years ago hearing making reappearance got excited game againhowever content game progressed huge amount given time new content exists hard enjoy due changes gameplay constant hard reset areas incredibly slow rate finding even weak items carry areas discourages exploration takes lot fun awaythe new content older gameplay mechanics would make game much enjoyablein current state dont think game worth purchase gets updated things change could well become worth itbut hey thats opinion game massive potential turned mobile game heres game beautiful environments feed itch explore heres issue game infinite procedural generation punishes exploration making restart progress character mobilityspecial items gear name thing doesnt reset artifacts gain like mobile game system could valid valid issue lies fact artifacts simply give useless stat increases like swim speed run speed lantern brightness real sense progression area easily take hours complete quests bland travel boring forced walk hang glider special item crossed border new region interesting issue multiplayer well start complete opposite side world partner isnt issue go town use hawk quick travel friend issue gear useless yes starting gear useless another starter zone couldnt damage enemies even white named easiest enemies real fun friend used cheat engine increase fire rate even shooting arrows speed minimal damage get game unless done research agree current system place maybe even wait see anything changes im counting modding community make betaalpha combination alpha mechanics betas new worlds game much potential still good game mods mods tho game potential two developers working could apparently take advantage years developement thousand copies sold would hire anyone help money got game worst main developer teasing lot content game twitter years releasing beta steam none added final build another thing note made announcement explain anything related game even censored people critizing game steam forums bbefore buying game read rest review check recents videos people playing game videos alpha bso lets talk gamelist unlike rpgs dont get anything except gold sometimes stuff killing mobs dont skill trees either level finding artifacts hidden region leveling doesnt get great benefits except shinier lamp faster glidingswimming speed parts world divided regions time move another region stuff nerfed useless new region meaning refind better stuff region since artifacts doesnt get stat boost attackdefense things like almost starting new character gear loot randomly game permanent either become useless like normal gear regions apart gear nerfed stuff like hangglider boats reigns ride pet disappear crossing region find new region get back go back region found friend group system place make multiplayer friendly loot personnal get damage lore poor uninteresting quests consists killing mobs classes op ie fire mage kill every enemy melee class damage abusive glitch like flying dedicated servers must everyone friend list want play npcs quests easy find since anything head anything else distinguish spawnrate natural ressources used crafting materials poor mods support none plannedlisti could go game im disappointed even continue talking even indie developpers excuses game skeleton game years development moreover sold game people advertised features never came web archive game page url could taken time develop ask advice community feels like wanted make cashgrab game would proud still sure want buy game go see recent videos lookup alpha videos since game changed lot made mind game much potential creators took everyones money long ago delivered something way worse years later total crap nothing like initially promised worse game years ago dont recommend giving dime money game much potential back beta stage however current state recommend level means nothing sure level system even exists point items find one area cant take use another area makes exploring past leveled pointless go play trove free much better place game must play something similar game much potential original alpha fun open world sandbox rpg version game wasnt well received original still potential great abandoned instantly released steam im always saddened see game library wish dev still worked really fleshed cube world heart gone forgotten game high potential alpha fun well thought game dev disappeared high potential game lost excited game finally get released high potential game money grabber region lock restricting hours put one region irritating different artifacts find barely even boost bosses easy hard game couldnt balance anything honestly majorly disappointed years waiting fantastic alpha evolve something great wasted dev never gave game care love deserves wasted potentialtldrthe dev gave game thought believe created free money game potential fell flat fun first hours gameplay realize nothing left area decide go neighboring region find gear useless items like hang glider boat locked another region start get completing region tiny upgrade stats dont much help game really wish developer would added game better progressionleveling system game feels rewarding resetting items little satisfactionedit playing game mods makes whole lot better plan buying game recommend getting mods let use gear across multiple borders make enemy scaling thing game fine base alpha alot fun new version really clear goal wonder play hour half friend really didnt get anywhere killed alot enemies quests thing show sword got alot gold coins couldnt spendi want game good fun play region locked equipment real progression wondering gets boring really quickly especially everyone deals much damage way much damage game ok right could much better really needs work done certain areas game lot great potential combat system great loot system great dungeons great also like animals creatures turn flattened pixels killed dont like armor weapons region land locked move another area armor weapon effect lands like get purple bow damage one land damage xp system tells far close leveling game unlimited exploration creatures fight fun game play got right gear dying fast still play game wallay doesnt get rid region land lock armor weapons hoping changes future game lot potential still fun needs major fixes fix lag way fun friends lag needs kind trading system ai little buggy running circles targeting playersi hope helpful hope fixes would considered game lot potential potential put game remain dull task playi purchased game half decade ago feels almost nothing substantial added changed good anything theyve added mystery meeverything one shots little help even story line objective ive playing hours recently boring really really hope make fantastic game im sure could goo last years doubtfuli would love able recommend game currently cannot game lot potential needs lot workbring back actual leveling relics dont even help lose youre weapons zones boats para gliders go away going zones weapons equipment downgrade selfs zoning overall harder get good gear shouldnt scale feel like actual progression rather felling like zone go go back overall enjoying playing game friends point driving force make want play future game steep learning curve need come like region roguelike carryover perks complete region leaving frombut extremely difficult started really enjoying game style design things would like change complain still fun playing since alpha looking forward friends playing feel team make game easier altogether enjoyablewallay know long hard road congratulations getting release let people appreciate work take away ignore people complain everyone opinions trolls game ways go id recommend buying proper review fashion im gonna give pros cons give final verdictpros game fun multiplayer ive thoroughly enjoyed playing friends moments pretty frustrating overall enjoyable experience combat engaging playing pretty much class decimating enemies hours region fun world gen good ive run one major issue hill blocking treasure another hill respawn points relatively common game isnt buggy issues nothing totally game breakingconsregion locking gear items get region artifacts rare gear locked region get wouldnt much issue artifacts offered useful effects stands artifacts offer noncombat buffs many argue overall pointless top region locking messing gear resets equipment hang glider boat every time requiring gather every time go new area sense crossregion progression unless value swim speed multiplayer lag host youll experience latency enemy ai go location arent anymore player latency much extreme inhibiting ability properly fight even good connection enemies overpowered imagine youve spent hours working towards best gear get area get decimated mage full tier lower balance something much needs workthe final verdict id recommend remember cube world want play friends dont recommend singleplayer additionally decide buy dont go expecting alpha better thats game wouldnt really recommend game developer fixes major issues community game adventure surprises much new player discover old version game really didnt much offer walk around level fight new bosses get items pets explore new biomes beta version much time admit much harder older version thats makes game entertaining even though might concept still new things try new biomes new enemies new loot collect mega update cube world like done game keep good work game beautiful visuals fun game sit friends explore world game part life since reason computer first placethe games core really fun charming held back new progression systemin opinion xp mobkilling needs brought back otherwise completely pointless kill mobs artifacts also need buffed right theyre really useless enough incentive keep reseting moving zone zone hope funck tweeks progression system near future hope game eventually universally praised masterpiece game able preserve old sense playing whole new adventure embark upon game makeing years believe grade found game looked kickass problem couldnt buy waited waited finally play years waiting totaly worth game well put together even thought im writing ill played hours hours got totaly engaged anyone reads review gather nice game good graphics fantastic world fantasy beauty totaly buy one thing im gonna say want hang glider dont know get one please help ive fallen death please game come long way almost died update mod removes region lock garbage wayyyy fun overall elements still removal skill tree kinda lame imo sure wouldnt mind added another update someone found way mod game evolved lot since alpha although lot negative reviews people dont like new changes takes hours getting used cube world certainly worth wait im glad got early book game evolved since alpha progression good concept needs abit fine tuningquests need variety requires main questall recommend start till end somegive game time appreciate considering team two people game fallen alpha best part mid childhood cant look game like almost downgrade alpha dont buy fond memories reason devs needs reconsider everything theyve done game last years dont know make many bad choices basic things game given new life rpgs excited happy play rpg isnt based mindless cp grinding progress ruined many games people play together game allows friend jump world caught minutesnot days feel good challenging game cant handle something new world warcraft years old still head game people want evolve gaming world thanks putting solid game together game great ideas implemented wrong paper region locking sounds good couple means transport randomness enemies open logic means level upno cohesion mechanics makes game fungame isnt fun anymore game incredible potential however seeing creator gone completely awol us pretty much abandoned game worth youre one people enjoying grinding lose progress grind youll repeat throughout entire gameplay fyi go ahead buy preferably sale first hours gameplay youll blast youll cussing balls game make wait long im really happy play game nice little details thats everything game region lock system poor attempt making game last longer fails miserably theres little nothing map dungeons way level fortunately already mods remove shit parts add good parts taken away go check cube world reddit even game boringat best worth bucks game form meaningful progression whatsoever nothing pushing forward absolutely nothing making want progress past first region even mentioning bizarre design choices region lock gear progression dont buy game worth time current state game none charm alpha basically wandering around biome gear acquire artifact rinse repeat levelling rng dependant even end getting great stuff different class many frustrations recommend game potential hope one day change review positive one biggest thing game lacks progression never feel like youre really gaining anything combat somehow feels less polished alpha came years ago chore gain new gear time bosses take forever kill drop gear another class game went grinding enemies exp grinding armor pieces didnt really add anything far tell beta removes farm adds makes one ponder much game actually worked years keep eye game dont buy yet hopefully wollay listen criticisms make game vast majority love game problems still worth look years ago still fun ride non less game much potential mechanics yet ultimately falls short execution mechanics ultimately feeling odds game feels like precipice greatness yet yetmaybe one day game could reach precipice either update modding stands completely board current state game would recommend giving pass maybe checking back time game much potential really seems like every chance gets game waste players time progression sluggish unrewarding good amount enjoyability game comes hoping procedurally generated world blesses interesting dungeon encounter player little agency experience grand open sandbox adventure railroads along stripping progress every zoneoverall experience fun enjoyed friends think updates changes progression system reworking artifacts increase stats increase base stats like hp attack instead exploration stats like glide boat speed stats become useless exploring new zones lose items upon entering new zone game would absolute blastid recommend keeping eye game watch someone else play seems like speed definitely give chance wont lie fairly disappointed still commend wollay pixxie hard work theyve put crafting product clearly love passionate hopefully game updated way personally find enjoyable ill likely enjoying something else doesnt mean though definitely encourage reading reviews people positive experience game making decision buy game played young lade hours pumped say probloms leveling system still fun still enjoy game fixes leveleing system get better game lot fun played alpha things id keep like skill lineup things im glad different like substantial single player experience great playing game complete downgrade alpha many features removed replaced nothing crafting almost useless level skills either game feel like complete downgrade alpha much potential game disaster hope gets better yet still like rages game disaster years many tweets teasing us amazing content scrapped everything ruined progression killed game going back alpha least progress version game fun voxel game would recommend people play hard first keep going learn use combat system better matter class youll fine game good one isnt people expecting changed simple action rpg action adventure gamecube world one chill game ive played world feels great alive exploring fun journey discover every point interest feels great kinda immersive old school way talk npcs mark map objectives go explore games days feels like breath fresh airthat said game isnt everyone progression zone based turns type roguelike adventure gear collectibles resets zone bad thing didnt bothered getting gear pretty easy midtier gear exploring pretty easily without dying muchalso play alone friends zone based gear great go friends zone dont legendary gear got alone cant boost shit friend wish way around boos friend fun game exploration wandering world searching new artifactscombat feels great easy punishing enough youll die lot leaving dark souls feelings thats good thing honest opinionthe lack class progression thing really bothered rpg skill tree would great giving depth classes character could isnt focus game anymore seemsin conclusion game lot personality really well developed runs great works nicely looks amazing everyone punishing hell yes things worked still great chill game pass time friends nice price recommend everyone likes games chill little world wander around explore alone friends hope wollay keeps working despite public response game lot potentialtldrpros great exploration sandbox mechanics amazing soundtrack nice difficulty cute fckcons lack character class progressionps maybe make reins ride pets equipment like rings amulets possibly keep getting version would help early game zone reset lot keeping general roguelike idea game lot fun play friends region lock annoying ways around id give go squad play game lot fun spent enough time first region pick decent number items time started exploring additional regions good bit carry power game isnt perfect however biggest valid complaint artifacts need give meaningful buffsi original alpha player like beta better alpha game lot fun quite bit different alpha might say worse version dont think necessarily worse different lot exploration focused character progression revolving around increasing efficiency utility items boat reins lantern etc opposed making character unstoppable machine combat lot enjoyable alpha gear upgrades feel much immediately impactful getting around map lot easier well addition shrines quick travel flight paths instead dictating power levels gear based meaning catch friend power level really fast nobody feels left behind also dont waste several levels worth experience unlock boatsglidersreins like alpha find theyre immediately usablehowever flaws refind utility items every zone gets little annoying direction heavily depends getting town roaming npcs give relevant information quests dont might feel little aimless new zone overall might everybody especially averse large changes still fun especially group friends id say well worth price tag especially sees future updates improvements game interesting one though think game regressed alpha version believe still fun going new world starting anew learning worlds enemies game ton fun problem fun time limit get powerful able sweep worlds gets much boring get bored theres nothing game needs much longevity play hours game absolutely amazing thrill zelda series dd twist tough game hardcore faint heart people become wussies dying times one thing certain die die lot game need talk people get quests appear map must get artifacts reins flute harp boat glider etc make sure keep pet foods get loyal attack petmount run around withi absolutely love game hope keep developing bravo game actually still really awesome look forward potential updates steal people pissy changes alpha still great game edit never updated game sorta dissatisfying game acutally rly funny played years ago alpha rly happy hear cube world coming back long years waiting early beta available ppl played alpha updating every single day release steam everything twitter postings reactions nothing sure happend time feel scammed game amazing play mulitplayer said devs vanishing inbetween updates doesnt bode well flawed game improving game amazing highly reccomend people indie lover community full actionpacked adventure looks super cute super high quality graphics scary strange monsters lurk darkness love rate stars would friggin tril game amazing great combat leveling system great play friends sure must buy game amazing take everything say grain salt saying never played alpha couldnt get got taken game great downsidesprosthe game looks amazingthe soundtrack lovelythe different classes subclasses means everyone something instance scout beserker methe way enemies spawn seems better alpha believe alpha spawned x z went harder enemies got versus regions different types monsters hanging different quests different levels monstersand whole lot could talk aboutcons game tutorials making learning start bit challenge didnt play alphaitems armor region locked excluding artifacts equipment makes game less get good items blitz game less restart every region region system needs improvement idea good execution isnt hot maybe countries took space like regions depending powerful country would betteroverall still enjoy game definitely things could improved feel confined one region get good items region game applies certain type people dont think deserves hate getting bad game could use improvement game heart cube world however needs lot work nonetheless wonderful game years ago except odd region specific equipment leveling system still fun game also people game made spare time priority commendable came pretty decent components made cube world great needs updates game awesome friends game awesome first wasnt huge fan went kept falling deeper love see disliking youre games dont hold hand explore forever willprobably lots fun things seem like issues released hopefully thosewill fixed point considering released arent many noticable issues whative seen anyway kinda reminds trove better personally hate mmos like themlike trove wanna play solo friends connect interneteverytime perfect first initial load theres basically nothing wait foryou join friends quickly come back leaving session spawn exactly wereits amazing game beautiful fun items diverse visually interesting visuals pleasant zone challenges lets improve incrementally player travel system solid playing friends great experience progression system like anything ive experienced excited see plays game beautiful isgameplay insanely good snappy responsive controls fun characters great art stylebutit could much remove region lock bring exp back change artifacts give actually usefull bonuses add enimies beyond current max strength levelthis good game certainly much betterwollay love love made cant wait see youve got next game broken less minutes already found movement breaking glitch isnt normal multiplayer also broken tried play friend spawned km apart really hope change future playable right game classic ill support way first giving positive review game decently different alpha im sure liked better yet first bit crawl usual ive heard resets cause game act way quite biteither way wollay made game practically quite accomplishment im glad able support alpha game definetly used greatly changed aspects definetly bad game still fun play though changes quite annoying lead hard enjoy game nearly long new build current price point dont know id buy unless money really isnt issue game wouldve much worth despite changes fact dont enjoy like used game really good especially take consideration made one personso tldr good game buy youre expecting cube world old whole game current state game definitly expected managed get cube world first back sank hours game exploring leveling ranger get epic gear eventually got boring repetetivenessthe release taken different approach community situation feels hello games launched game mans sky salty expected reality actually offersif look game objectively think fun exploring encountering different creatures one downside encountered artifacts going several hours figuring get artifact sometimes walking around aimlessly trying figure find said dungeon know navigate map super easy find artifact give climbing speed made confused hoping would maybe give boosts like example permanent damage boosts boost certain items maybe something bit like diablo get enhancements suddenly lifesteal maybe attacks aoe damage keep naming forever get pointif wollay already completely disheartened negative reviews highly encourage try figure different kind artifacts would way go game empty horrendously balanced void tutorials missing certain functionality like leveling past one think anything id say enjoyable playtime reason made almost hours long takes actually travel anywhere game fabulous everything fantasticto begin real cube world release version taken best alpha everything love removed flaws wrapped exciting finalised package let explain many reviews hate changes people complain gear regionlocked feel dont see main goal game used old cube world gigantic empty regions need wander around exploring lands one played ton alpha know like imagine quests simply need anymore developer added elaborated quest system reason keep entertained times goal game like many others complete quests almost fun possibly get game became fast dynamic levelling aka gearing quick lets complete quests one progress super fast lucky drops reach toprarity gear within twothree hours compared absolute days gameplay alpha simply need xp levels stupid grinding bosses action people respond yeah game reward anything ill say wrong rewards ton fun like old cube world better faster snappier feels like decent pc upgrade whats better fun endless start time need create another character become overpowered onehit strongest bosses simply choose another location enjoy new exciting adventure therefore vision new cube world simply good complete tenhour play repeat many times want games replayed even fewer give unique experience every time priceless course cherry cake gives artifacts get keep goal game essential part artifacts nothing little bonus upgrade skills choose wisely try get one upgrade actually would like makes whole lot fun main thing sum say definitely recommend game especially havent played alpha get cube world feeling familiar versions probably sceptical release hope review make give another chance try feel game game fantastic exceptions solo play seems interesting really havent given shot mainly playing multiplayer fun get explore vast world friends making jokes laughing entire way onto cons dont xp system rather based artifacts lot fun really slows progression come think progression doesnt really exist region based second leave region might well start new character would like see go back days alpha progression farther went spawn harder things far would recommend game give game fantasticif played alpha might disappointed see many things changed urge play open mindi think wollay done game fantastic opening end game many possibilities infinite replayability grindy xp levelling system replaced regional equipmentbased levelling overall artefactbased stat improvement system first might think region locking issue opinion promotes exploration finishing one region another also enables play friend matter character leveli would definitely recommend game anyone interested explorationbased rpgs game fantastic little kids looking spoon fed everything want instantly meant immature brats looking max level right away get instant gratification game meant person wants earn get play game long time enjoy adventure leveling pace meant challengingpay attention downvotes kids want everything want right away without earning real game kids game focused around running around hour baiting enemies friendly npcs collect gold drop game players like exploring vast open game world case nearly infinite want grindingfighting therethis game players search deep interconnected lore complex characters thingsi like idea region based progression system allows game challenge player continuously game offeres good amount content variety though procedurally generated games limits means point game encounter repetetive patterns however think developers really good job minimizing effectsi definetely recommend game new playersnote many negative reviews players dont like changes made since alpha release nevertheless think good game game fun becomes repetitive hope game continues updated added add type leveling system ways improve multiplayer feels clunky play friends go area map makes world feel little bit empty would still recommend cube world boring current state game fun still much game back alpha changes encourage keep exploring past normally would back alpha yes problems artifacts dont feel rewarding enough developer isnt great communication think lot uproar based around game fun ways alpha changes keep exploring longer always favorite partthe game definitely wasnt released normal way problems small fixes think game would amazing good game fun first hours alpha player lack content past first hours quite disappointing spawn quests quickly go crappy gear overpowered gear head next region endless cycle gets stale incredibly quickly fact way really progress game gain artifacts give incredibly minor buffs useless stats means reward progression hope wollay reconsiders region locking brings back least skills artifacts provide true rewards skills continue playing see everything game offer leave negative review even though honestly dont want wollay changes something game god tier game good yeah context wikihow game overall fun wouldnt recommend solo game great except one thing region locking loot believe since many people dislike wollay probably change doesnt somebody inevitably make mod game great im much fun discovering every zone game great everything wished alpha like exploration based games love game promisethe game pretty simple create character go hand holding quest markersthis game one core loop goes look stuff defeat repeat equiped face dungeon region defeat boss get artifact finish region region start step never become powerful feel mastered whole world artifacts form permanent progresscombat simpleyour offensive options light attacks heavy attacks sometimes class specific skillyour defensive options dodging warrior block running life healingmy gripe artifacts much impact gameplay wise buff non combat stats increased gear game great landbound progression isnt bad players make seem theyre used alpha version game pussies cant handle change youve never heard game extremely fun highly recommend buying game hella fun good friends play get bit boring game honestly one best games ive ever played need play trust game impossible start alone prepare spend hours searching weapon class mage weapons pile bag course friend two playing different classes always let carry best get oneshot gear actually use drops game incredibly underwhelming considering alpha better game big oof game pain play multiplayer least peertopeer basis laggy rubberbanding everywhere combat chore deal meaningful rewards enemies sometimes enemies drop nice gear wont even class traveling mostly walking around food everywhere get needed item ride animal everything kinda feels boring wanted enjoy game based remember years years ago aint chief game fun remember first played years ago gameplay decisions made dont agree region locked weaponry stale gameplay one region still love game wollay plans continuing feed content game continue play years come game boringnot bad great boringand make game exploring entire world discovering lore said world collecting artifacts make character stronger boring youve done something wrongunless game gets major updates line actually becomes fun dont buy gamefind play alpha instead much better game like bowl cereal except instead milk devs decided use lukewarm water game like funny joke strongly recomended buy crap played circa hours alpha game unplayable level entrance new player high bad class balance game nice play love dont care people says wollay still updating game love game longer alpha much clashing game design makes experience fun gear region locked makes getting kind loot pointless leveling system means point killing anything information hidden player reason literally go devs twitter find important gameplay information dev hasnt said anything since games official launch dont hope update anytime soon dont buy game game remembered playing alpha many years ago good memories expected get similar experience instead developer yet abandoned supportive community instead even addressing anything gone radio silent game everyone certainly enjoy game everyone tired standard rpg formula maybe give try favorite parts rpgs start getting butt kicked everything every scrap loot god send yes cube world lose gear start move zones negative reviews complaining though best part geared untouchable longer fun enough power fantasy games jam hard findcompleting area like playing hour adventure rpg enough price id say enjoyed want play move new area start adventure new settingbiomealso playing coop much easier start new area together equals friend plays work levels doesnt understand dont want group anymore game good fun times mostly laughing absurdity game friendsbesides fact game promised people gotten worsethe main goal game collecting artifacts dont give anything useful gliding speed thanks thatll really handy exploring next area oh wait dont glider anymore equipment exploration tools regionlocked thats fun honestly wish hadnt bought game years ago encouraged make garbagevisual game great opinion worth buythere many areas improved vastly alpha gotten worsestarting hard next gear engagements difficult win youll avoid fighting unless npcs nearby pick weak enemy group fight one one get good gear progressing starts pick pacethe quests stuff great give something goal work towards rewarded good stuff much better aimless alphathe shrines life good bad provide fast travel points great much appreciated also respawn points must find one respawn really sucks go long way quest die respawn way back run trip way back little annoyingthe region locked gear massive downer completed every quest found starting land decided move next happened ocean sailing went past boundary boat disappeared many items lost strength really sucks grinding playing naught gave upthere cool new abilities know ranger since thats one ive played close range kick gone close quarters combat options really lame shadow shooter cool ability like still wish kickthe game music think good different music title screen victories different biomes etc like lotvillages much cooler though game music vast improvement npcs little say new races enemy mobs cool progression system stops playing beyond founding region dont feel tempted go see new stuffmixed feelingsif youre sure dont buy full price hopefully itll go sale point game nearly bad people saying biggest issue people game region lock system thought pretty good idea old game grinded character amazing fair took decent amount time get point oneshot literally everything anywhere map youre done new region lock system helps remedy problem always giving something im saying system perfect people complaining aboot nothing far perfect actually get bit repetitive think system good idea poorly executedanother issue people game compared alpha fact skill trees removed dont gain exp also problem reason kill monsters small chance getting leftovers weapon piece armour still get skills class like ninja throw shurikens get right away progression whatsoeverin end think game isnt bad everyone else making alpha still enjoyable respect developer trying something new region lock system really seen rpgs perhaps dev put thought itis game worth bucks maybe chance would update im keeping hopes never seen go sale still worth moment game perfect game world still lacks lot thingsbut creators made game amazing however wish cubeworld would tagged earlyaccess game keeps improving game used developed alpha phase playing feels really slow progressing exploring gaining gear game also give clear indication progressas many reviews made clear trying multiple games basecore game fit progression style type game might fun people version cube world fun anymore game even similar promise made years ago changes years development finally received empty repetitive shell game looks outside fun bits removed bought game picromas website several years ago blast aint chiefsure game runs great got excellent style simplified combat okay first enter new zone welcome back square one enjoyable part alpha leveling gearing exploring friends decide try game simply cannot recommend get ready boring frustrating run across lots empty space overpowered enemies seemingly endless nighttime game one best games ever playedi think wallay need perpos atefacts game one games ive ever seen go properly backwards game isnt fun anymore progression system sucks gameplay design basic game design trash powered enemies actually probably worst game ive played year game good cheese high level bosses entering new area ignore rest content game pretty fun accept permanent progression isnt really thingedit crashes permanently cant open techy enough follow fixes also notably many bugs game notably main form progression artifacts literally work simply doesnt actually affect anything ones work sailing speed lamp radius would check back years see anythings fixed make decision game pretty good idc people say itjust beacuse easy alpah virsion mean enjoyubleif looking chill game take time grinde one game pure exploration cube world unique action person rpg system without xp game remind rogue like game completing biome allows character get small gains going new biome mean restarting zero small gains system allows infinite gameplay unless get bored theres multiple different biome

vision game ultimately creation said game right almost laughably unfun game much fun game took come ive lot fun far game used lot fun level ups genuine progression feels like lifeless copy game amazing alpha poured hundreds hundreds hours game small yet endless little grindy friends gift god arealocked items starting anew every time game still amazes beautiful artstyle amazing unique combat almost element exploration gone thrill want cross border already every location game amazing game good believe give vollay release game disappointment boys good hours playing realized every new area go completely reset pretty much good hours gameplay gets super repetitive game abandoned developer immediately steam release september bugs lack satisfying progression beta complex interesting refined final release isnt enough content support price tag tried really hard like game cant help find lackluster droning dont buy game waste game amazing back alpha played hundreds hours loved full release awful one simple reason removed sense progression used level get better gear always skills whenever enter new regionarea legendary items become useless youre back square onethe permanent upgrades tiny move speed upgrades game amazing dogshit horrible leveling system wish way used alpha game better years ago would better find version trash game better area locked equipment thing game fun first got lucky got basic gear drops enemies near spawn found village close starter experience pretty good curious wasnt gaining experience killing mobs found experience read post artifacts new way level sort magical item increases level quests got blues purples found dungeon looked like old style one alpha got artifact dungeon moderately boring fight got first legendary piece close new area went found blue mob attacked got slapped silly confused went back time gliding fell glider change new zone get gear removed idea happens top level gained doesnt give new abilities increase stats way need sort character progression new skills better gear want something work towards play hours legendary gear probably wont play experience added dont get downgraded leaving zone maybe play let sure game fun back literally change game yeas ago fun u enemies health almost oneshot worth buying game good alpha back went silent years updates stopped playingi tried playing recently came steam like totally different game died almost immediately start game everything killing stuff remember couldnt couldnt figure cant recommend game game getting regular updates responding feedback might positive creator tendency go silent years produce massive changes totally change game mostly worst game great smells like broken promises point cant recommend game less features alpha years ago skill tree removed gear region locked progression system great either first item ever found legendary wand quadrupled health times damage starting gear starting gear way absolutely nothing mobs get hit everything gear stronger variants starting gear unique weapons makes game feel repetitive skill based movement every enemy face hugs really dodge run around pillar hopefully game gets substantial updates would play againbad things aside game fun hours played completed entire region got cool gear would like play friends tough bosses game great played high school back however changes longer recommend fun anymore feels like different game really sad happened cubeworld game highly anticipated wollay working years however stopped updating uploaded anything since week release enjoyed cube world alpha beta trainwreck recommend anyone find alpha version cubeworld thats cubeworld fell love game hyped like mans sky feels lackluster truthfully want like game cant come waited years essentially polished turd game ridiculous long development time got worse version alpha like good old days without xp skill tree system rpg without leveling system years progression got promised really hope updates bring back feeling alpha even improvements game bootleg version alpha game childhood alpha awesome gone far south good things game gone incentive like level ups collecting items gear move new region goes away gear becomes useless artifact powers absolutely useless compared alpha worth biomes small empty especially ocean ones use water biomes full mobs server purpose except op kill dont even get xp killing

better game good developer come shadows respond critiques respected still saying nothing make situation worse youre human make mistakes time change connection community good luck future game great truly perfect balance talent changed dev team atacked truly wonderful place harmony game one bought alpha first came sunk lot time friends couldnt wait update creator however vanished didnt show posting small teasers twitter day came released steam included new content however hopes game dashed right starting play everything fun enjoyable alpha ripped left bland skeleton everything region locked feels like make progress overall good experience creator also vanished feelings hurt game steam one purchase game serves line pocket dev cries corner mean reviewers game exciting back alpha however fun features made game great removed replaced tedious region locking system game fun playing first region loses charm equipment items worked get rendered uselessthat said find playing equipment skill leveling systems tweaked reintroduced alpha build seemingly losing progression takes away fun coming someone put hours alpha build cant find playing since slow tedious game play hope see wollay come hiding continue put game game trash like excited multiplayer didnt work bro game wack would never play game rave years years ago shame legacy thrown dirtnew update isnt anything poor excuse progression loopdont get wrong id love give good review really would good aspects buy unless something major changes unlikelyat least didnt pay game wasnt ready full release fully expected enjoy lengthy early access period steamsimply put theres severe lack features progression busted right super punishing towards player actually choose explore entire game generates really anything unique memorable terrain generation also worse alpha thats kindof lot comes actual beta years ago better state game full release right nowim hoping wollay listens feedback actually works playerbase instead dipping never responding criticism tossed way want game improved dont buy right honestly experience entirety game within first zone hours game went fun action packed exploration game frankly really good rpg really bad essentially rpg elements exist game like game either gone really really poorly thoughtoutexecuted personally dont think wouldve hard take alpha state game add content release wollay years work instead reason unbeknownst everything made game fun taken away first started playing watered version cube world genuinely fun quickly changed theres sense reward progression exploration aspect feels like punch face due issues forcing explore top issues game unbelievably difficult good reason anyone would start playing game probably die many many time first hour realize mobs kill easily feel like happened hardtoo resource dependent make content game combat wollay decided making game terribly boring grindfest real end goal would make game feel like substance either way isnt worth please wait see updates come attempt fix problems game kick ass early rank gear youll struggle defeat foes get going youll game like perfect visuals good sound design simple yet fun combat system leave starting region star gear becomes worthless flaw massive hopefully one day itll change get challenging player important could least create illusion character still powerful infinitely increasing monster stats loot stats regions game think reviews say fun game worse alpha disagree alpha levelling system beat left one shotting literally everything infinite quick progression made game boring days version however theres slow progression things dont directly affect combat gameplay might stay every time leave region stays fun way game great way spend time friends extremely satisfying get good weapon area refreshing get new area game would amazing purchase guy named frost game would perfect actual leveling system region locking gear game would pretty good different liked alpha steam release unpleasant games pretty disappointing wollayd actually spent time flesh expand upon progression alpha wed much extensive game somewhere within last months year wait threw opted different means progression say happens somewhere within last months twitter post wollay made months ago shows exp still thinginstead getting fleshed rpg experience base alpha expanding instead got last minute attempt reworking core gameplay attempt combat power bloat works dont find fun game made seems emphasis exploration exploring randomly generated landscapes sprinkle hand crafted structures simply isnt fun mei enjoyed grinding getting stronger taking strength continue grow take bigger threats strength strictly based equipment becomes obsolete leave region getting stronger time getting better equipment gather artifacts area ever slightly increase exploration speed lantern light radius move onto next region start games systems inherently flawed could write book said worthy successor alpha enjoyable yes first region two comes ugly realization hard progression outside making ephemeral movement artifacts slightly better greater goal work giving game short lived gameplay loop top myriad problems hasis worth checking sure sale cheap happy cube world finally getting updated time actually got chance play betai feel like would better wollay let game fade past game fun hours redo everything old one better dungeons leveling new one barely anything last game laggy gear rare thats kinda part made fun well unless updates game deadi technicaly got game free since bought alpha game say simply full good bad ugly gave game thumbs given still works opinion holds remains seen first game lot promise much potential content already put shows game lot love itthe goodtrue word games map procedurally generated like minecraft two maps even items randomized certain extent unfamiliar game plays part like rpg kill enemies go quests obtain items character explore world around game much playable part enjoyable later got hang mechanics alot fun itthe controls part hard learn besides standard wsad space combinations maps zoom feature quite welcome one see landscape even one hasnt visited area yet makes finding nearest town spawn point activate much easier helps planning routes different points possible interest rather neat visit different nooks crannies see mobs could spot loot could obtain find npcs talk tothe pet system remains prior version nice fun find corgie find reins ride around map little doggo whos good boy youre good boy badthe camera wee bit hard control times particularly climbing attacking long range makes fighting mental panic mode bit hard killed many many times trying get bead opponent well leveling system changed alpha version standard experience system sort find better gear mechanic made going opponents much tougherit help step another zone gears abilities useless including boat climbing gear spirit bell special item found every zone start square one annoying boat sailing mainland hit ocean zone suddenly boat useless gain access crossing back prior zone ocean nothing water several islands find boat required lot slow swimming island island islandthe enemies really act like thriving ecosystem enemies one would think would attack paced back forth moving others patrol zones without even much farting would loved see predators going reward dips prey animal aspect changed since original game game breaker would nice touch make world seem alivethe weapons armor much like original show little diversity outside stats number weapons least bow boomarang little variety kept finding type weapons armor one suggestion would create different grades armor type silk runed silk double weaved silk etc etc feels like level different prior onethe enemies become bit monotonous found least camps rock creatures red blue crabs onions roaming around space encampment rather wide considering middle wildernessthe learning curve bit steep took bit understand progression equipment leveling finding fight note fight pay gradewhile new character generates completely new random map one cant specify map seed one choose map play great feature old version one could explore one map jump another see done develop character buying pet bait jump back original map pet bait cycle stores fact one cant travel across different world favorite character sorely missed abilitythe uglythe biggest flaw game lag towns game turned mess slide show aspect reared head wilderness albeit less often usually group dialogue giving npcs roaming game would begin slow point almost unplayablethere also issue one changes key bindings one session reset next game session instead setting keys comfortable play keep referencing

legendary chest plate weapon im rather powerful right unexplored regionsi see grind might become tedious ive put hours game felt bored alone makes worth selling price disclaimer bought game alpha participated closed betaand even biomes im itching explore ive conquered total regions characters one region even two artifacts collected warrioranyhow charming game collie lot fun fighting stuff fun coop mods remove region lock would recommend playing without friends mods thoughscout water mage playable solo classes fun game ranged charcter dont want die often fun game especially multiplayer makes game much fun exciting community lot words give really short time please patient game would recommend grab friend trying friend swell time hopping zone zone looking chaos running dungeons etc fun mess around definitely wouldnt devote chunks time grinding soloall game much potential severe contradicting design choicestldr thumbs overall gameplay newly added mechanics heavily reduce enjoyment clearly originally made pure adventure gameas early alpha player review based past present experiencesvery indie games made excited future much cube world foundation simple enjoyable yet time would fly whenever sat played game reason pure joy going adventure never really knowing random cliff suchthe beta update core gameplay extremely conflicting ideas could seperated create different modes instead main gameprosartifacts items made significantly enticing run dungeons due permanent stat increases came though im disappointed increase damagedefenseregions way variety beta havent seen every structure type yet excited see biomes may addedcoop fact easily travel truly blessing would like constant hpmp bar party members like alpha thoughcombat similar alpha slightly expanded super simple yet tactical fighting something pretty much one shot great work partyconsregion lock biggest gripe world would add region lock key items lost moving another region like hitting brick wall middle playthrough would fine losing weapons losing glider rein boat thats little insane also affects farming items id need couple yellows go get artifact three throw everything away move onto next region item feels insignificant even carry coinciding regions also ruins point farming materials like wood oresgeneration though enjoy new structures seems obvious im going run map encourages skip several places rather check everything world bosses randomly placed world would nicequests give reward going back town npc easier find reward going area clearing talking npc town honestly pointless pretty much see everything map anyways outside possible key itemimprovementsremove region locking key items make one key item findable per regionadd consistent way items certain amount cubes added weaponreadd health indicators party members left side screenbut importantly recreate system truly play adventure gamethis game much potential really hope wollay pixie implement ideasmy alpha review beta review good game mean good game people played alpha expected alpha appreciate design choices made great game im glad got wish stuff got like boats hang glider especially armor weapon stayed next land find annoying im strong one area next enjoy game lot great game people complain isnt xp lvl syste way gear works honestly makes system isnt even neededpeople upset zone lock system also kinda like done one zone go next harder gear weaker makes game much fun since like op times instead nonstop system getting stronger exploring getting stronger lot fun great game appreciate fact wolley finished great game real childhood game waited forim glad kinda sad got little ruined alot easier get good stuff got full tier stuff hours version would take daysbut still happy really great steam code alpha account great gametldr game isnt people assume thus gotten negative feedback features alpha concepts removed wanted typical rpg progression voxelized world game might want try something new thats exploration based read onits difficult starting youll starting times dont know youre progression game isnt like youve seen games progress locked current region except geargear allows progress next area complete zone get permanent stat increases exploration stats take gear next region gives boost starting main goal get loot makes powerfulyour key items reset region along gear negative reviewers upset well lack class progression negative reviews based assumptions thought game would quality game one big benefits starting region never scale friends even new ones still progress show travel faster get see new lands wont completely power content new friend hops hop new region explore together leave go back areas gear continue progression path theres fair amount quests everywhere think game great price point made two peopletheres hard work love put game shows major disappointment weve waited update since thing game needed content new biomes mobs skills etc instead got completly different game less features less satisfying progression waiting future updates recommend game currently really hard review ive watching lot people play game course week diving cube world feel lost shoved world information rather games progression system confusing choicethe loot drops cool playing mage class playthrough around hours already grinding bosses available every single drop compatible mage pardoning odd pet item means hard time making progression mage ended switching warrior make use items already gained tried exploring world got boat found self stuck water swimming despawns alongside loot go different biome map feature opinion makes sense halts progress makes restart scratch time want go take look around world could see fun situations option turn would nice playthrough many others like luckily already saint modding community game already fixed problem running tool every time launch game play way probably first placei understand acquire items gobetween biomes yet run rare way would like play continue play game little maybe even stream two probably wont last long unless major changes made took look developers main social media seems gone back radio silence mode replying anyones questions complaints shame would love hear thinking anything correct flaws game hasi played alpha stages game well really want upvote positive review good alpha cant changes made correct course gamei rate game disappointing shell former game much else say theres hardly anything new brag thing truly different fun sucked masterpiece game hope wollays sake handle negativity hes receive rip cube world step back alpha people may find fun region locked weapons character essentially starting every region isnt fun longer action based rpg roguelite tough one recommend still game incredible amount potential world pretty cool would fun explore wasnt empty would mechanics varied quests place small dev team implement features fix progression system open game modding could become next big game tricky one im recommending caveats think might tough game enjoy solo ive playing strictly coop weve definitely gotten twenty bucks fun need really enjoy starting feeble kit building powerful kit splatting big bad immediately returning feeble kit short fast cycle repeat new region travel lot salt reviews stems inability gain meaningful permanent strength instead reset noob levels new zone think interesting attempt avoid power creep definitely everyonemy frustrations game need either better torch less realistically black night way camp quickly forward dawn movement night meant punitive needs better ways mitigate little permanence game would help feel invested im frothy perregion gear still frustrating run exact loop every single zone home base stash artifacts trophies way keep mountboathangglider zone zone maybe customize really feel need something breaks sameyness biggest frustration easily howlermonkeylike reaction developer received sixyearold game sold time great whopping fortune likely ensured hes going vanish ether never touch game hope im wrong hell reappear sure dont blame never disappointing game played alpha hundreds hours loved itwollay dev abandoned game ran moneyfor new players might like played alphasave free code money fun game play bit find hard start picked ranger getting ass handed basic enemies got past really enjoyed game playhowever fan progression system feel like progress really fast lucky finishing region feels unrewarding great wont transfer artifacts get region increase quality life things faster riding speed light radius stamina consumption ect doesnt really help make progression feel different rewarding feel like starting game every regionbut things like combat think map amazing region feels unique unique animals enemies feel like lot effort put map really like joining friend smooth great experiences playing friendshere would like see would like see change progression system make finishing region feel rewarding especially buff artifacts feel like increase something make better damage resistance health ect biggest fan start gear useless new region would willing feel like got buffed everytime finished regionin end really hope dev makes progression system hope doesnt give see many negative comments especially lone dev really painful see really hope updates game becomes games ment abandoned good game played aplpha hours really like game doesnt get boring became op way much gear game became dull still boss battles dungeons still mostly became boring game soooo good wander arround always fun talk everyone soo cool give quest info funny also get good region usually explored mostly region get artifact game gets even better change region keep artifact gold etc lose gear making forced explore progress learn lore stuff different pages inventory soo brag front friends still materials gold find crafting book directly make stuff conclusion played game back recently turned still love much even amazing changes thanks wolframm weird game reason fun anymore played dont know many years ago loved boring reason shame also feels bit overpriced receive wrong shouldnt back enjoying alpha release dare youyou stolen dreams excitement empty update im one lucky ones people never experienced alpha people never experienced glory game dare amazing game always well worth wait ive sat years im glad finally showed equipmentbased exploration rpg vanilla doesnt suit mod like would bethesda game good game understand might recommend said dont recommend please civil developer hes good place right interesting game closed beta cube world changed dramatically simple elegant alpha version many things beta improved compared alpha systems game downright stupid alpha version start game every new character challenging bit grindy changed drastically new beta start challenging grindy alpha would generally improve character levelling acquiring better gear supplemented levelling character progression pretty stupid whole idea levelling getting artifacts pretty silly time consuming also reaps little benefits short term completely understand version aims encourage player explore many game systems also punish player exploring encourage explore removing special items shop scattering throughout biome fine problems one thing really dont like fact gear useless every biome except one found game element forces player stay inside starting biome therefore discourages exploration overall game systems quite counterintuitive take fun game also make extremely confusing beginning players feel game extreme potential shown start alpha feels wasted game would much better removed stupid features replaced traditional solutions coming someone little time alpha really worried buying game negative reviews hours say love entirely may missing things shown wollay may game everyone wanted far highly captivated excited exploring discovering world charm lacking games years im much fun questing figuring everything im excited able another region xp gain knowledge im blind see region lock clearly flawed system doesnt mean im loving every minute far removed original game vision people bought fun sucked dont bother buying dev vanished seriously dont believe anymore work done shame potential spent many hours proper previous version sure different game original alpha released however still incredibly fun especially friends ton replayability highly recommend game looking forward seeing wollay pixie future going review game also reviews trying ruin reputation game want say right reviewed played hoursdont listen cause chaos ruin good game would recommend looking reviews playing game least hours includes dont want see rest keep scrollingthings keep mind game made people hobby game everyone remember saw first alpha many things change alpha many things change future people desire always going get expect wollay isnt mind reader cant make everyone happy

runs smooth even lowend combat learning curve certain enemies careful however need look tier mobs capable worlds beautiful look may reallife type scenery times look lay land feel immersed voxel admit bugs game lowend laptop things wont render like title screen given time eventually renderoverall still young game even alpha came years ago given enough time much fun game like favorite baker makes best chocolate chip cookies world guy moves away eventually comes back town first thing makes sour dough raisin cookie like waiting years get degree clean toilets mcdonaldswatch take game first probably last time ever leaving steam review hopes maybe hear community make changesnot full review game fun anyone saying wasnt enjoyable lying potential game sadly cut short hoping first time enjoy complete first zone thats excitement ends game got hours got times worth guess fun play friends kidsfamily thats new favourite game everyones hating dev made big mistakes played hours game friends first week c losed beta fun ive long timethe reviews mixed early game extremely challenging still extremely fun game ive already spent hours cube world alpha way better feel like cash grab continuation vision saw alpha product instead entirely new direction unenjoyable one imagine playing windwaker every new island got sword longer damage hookshot gone need find king red lions nowhere seen start game every hours ten complete region get utility bonuses like gliding speed shame cant keep glider though good luck finding next meter lantern range also blitz getting artifacts create even shorter gameplay loop youd likeif enjoy version game power product expected backing alpha release perfect game bad game either six years silent development brought objectively good changes bad changes new quest system absolutely brilliant game even lively atmospheric personally like concept artifacts something newif dont mind region locked gear makes work every hours know id like see improved

updated alpha signed years ago things change time obvious roadmap tells completely different story paid said even worth giving proper review bad real bad one best games ive ever played people forget still early access theyre thinking finished game new beginning game region locking creates opportunity infinite gameplay pets new dungeons mobs kill make game much enjoyable well think game lost content hasnt quests still leveling still bosses still new different six years ago fact theres still much content within weeks available play impressive enough would always buy pathetic wanted end development game couldve done exactly insisted keeping peoples hopes released unfinished rush job steam called day years showed gameplay new update quests bosses dragons way back isnt game removed old version website get people buy cheap clone even like game story surrounding sad years works get version less content possibly one ambitious games ive seen far two people theme far perfect however quite enjoyable figure mechanics might take however quite rewarding actually see progression progress enjoyable playing friends found quite enjoyable discovering new things game found helpful myselfkeep mind game development two peoplepros unique game makes everything feel fresh harder rewarding actually forces gather informationcons unfinished game lot work example earlier stages camp possessed bosses leaves green tiered weapons early games basically boosting away need take events classes dont equal amounts class skills mage special attacks classes shift gives mage extra abilities etc music disappears youre spot long might pro making switch spots faster however feels quite lonely singleplayer ci dont recommend game people rely minecraft wiki get mean yeeah game grabs people enjoy exploration want figure smart ways play enjoy game unpolished diamond game give time order become something game game support community creator dont tosic probably going minority opinion game goodi bought original alpha version game years ago first came put probably hours course years since since getting beta access ive put probably hours beta week alonethere lot upset people alpha version disagree changes progression regionlocked gear aspects game understand complaints frankly first heard changes game kneejerk reaction played game ready start shoveling dirt onto game last week playing beta turned around completely new direction game long time follower game try explain believe new version goodlets flashback alpha first massive game endless exploration infinite leveling grinding monsters gear followed typical rpg rules staying traveled thats well good exactly one would expect rpg problem alpha version game despite skill trees exp based leveling persistent gear games always ended way friends around level would everything unlocked game reduced handgliding across areas minutes stopping every stomp boss seconds go back gliding rinse repeat massive areas reason stop explore reason visit towns reason talk npcs skill tree added illusion character customization reality served little purpose since combat related skills unlocked almost nothing except reducing cooldown abilities seconds per levelthe beta takes bolder riskier design approach class abilities unlocked right form start treats zone almost game instead flying skimming bosses area adventure start fresh talk townsfolk try learn artifacts key items regionally found set explore every nook cranny area areas littered content rewards player regionally within zone saving captured gnome boost regions shops sell better gear finding rare crafting book unlocks new crafting recipes area finding shrines unlocks new place revive die double unlockable fast travel locations makes finding rewarding useful finding reins boat glider gives player quality life mobility upgrades explore area better dungeons far larger alpha reward players rare artifacts level player rewarding small passive boosts swimming climbing sailing riding skills none combat related carry leave regionthe new system akin playing randomizer everytime enter new area start weak pleb thoroughly explore area key items improve quality life trying get better gear let tackle regions bigger threats ultimately get artifactsso big issue people fact move onto new region old gear reduced basic starter gear new area unless super rare piece equipment rare items retain old power neighboring areas debate detractors gear never diminished leave area sounds good theory literally flies face literally content thats designed last years literally every aspect games content based around new progression system allowing players keep gear new system would devolve game back alpha version flaws shallow gameplay consists flying zones snipe bosses levels new system lot longevity reverting old system would completely invalidate literally new contentthe current system perfect always rooms improvement growth much played alpha take rosecolored glasses recognize major flaws led stagnation gameplay hours artifacts could broadened give wider array passive bonuses stats even miniscule amounts cities could provide information region explaining many artifacts hidden found everything could sort reward full clearing region game could also better job explaining new players foundation development continues post launch get even betterat end day though current version game blast play single player cant say alpha boring quickly solo retaining multiplayer experience thats fun play friends joining games friends easy via ingame menu works great minus occasional dc simply requires reinvite new progression system means dont need worry multiplayer sessions ruined one friends plays much since meeting new regions brings people back mostly level playing field minus swimming climbing little faster suchi look forward seeing evolution game foundation blast play well worth asking price given amount hours ive already played week beta im sure lot detractors praising alpha denouncing progression system certainly right going everyone different game used honestly better game play game fun quite vast challanging game got play friend simple enough find even far apart big learning curb grindfest levels finding way earn money start getting better equip worth playing world much offer lore endless find playing lot many hours support devs worked hard long review left dr kawashima literally cant say better self agree everything sais biggest disappointment ive experienced year keeping short dont start ranting frustrationi dont even know say rpg

great want alpha play alpha warned isnt chiefthere nitpicks overall like die pet doesnt respawn one district final dungeon requires main item isnt found district classes different used alpha new

progression terrible almost nonexistant dont think need explain read anyone elses review theres point playing gear gonna resetseverely disapointed especially since supported game many years ago might biggest review ill make anyways cube world actually fun game progression kind good though yes prefer alpha progression system since could infinitely level enemies would scale levelthe removal skill tree really completely disnecessary skill tree great needed tweaking skillslevels game useless means many artifacts player nothing else nothing morethe artifacts really useless effects really small ones could obtained improved leveling upgrading items receive effect wollay decided thatregionlocking biggest problem far except isnt people including progression system works think making items like boats hanggliders reins also region locked bit much theyre pretty usefulnow honestly think progression systems good dont think good solution problem would make choice creating character would old progression system current progression systemlastly think old map generation added back way better since map generated went new places unfortunately hope wollay come back actually change game hasnt contacted community week wife new cube world fundamentally different paid alpha unique aesthetic would completely unrecognizable point game play put frankly unsatisfying points multi page reviews common enough wont even try cover everythingthere real sense progression level skill gear absolutely essential rpgthere exploration map static seeds gone fully revealed start quest system one biggest

interested playing back alpha sudden disappearance developer came big disappointment fast forward week ago excitement came back short time much game changed comparing released version alpha dont think changes best played hours trying work rewarding new progression system would tried class instructions able one shot mob time pretty awful way start progressed nonetheless end left nothing reset waiting next zone ultimately respect fact design changes made alpha shows clearly motivation developer improve upon game even official product wasnt greatit may nostalgia days playing back alpha bummer walk away game excited years ago negative things say wishing best luck wollay dont think anyone paying game game everyone knew played alpha hyped first time playing friends fun soon went new region fun died playing solo isnt fun whatsoever updates game going remain dead another years good game back alpha wollay removed features added didnt even put features showed twitter great disappointment compared old one even good game lot things left unclear confusing real guide formatting menus didnt help labels would really helped guess using small pictures right better alphai want like game dont combat okay thats really isthis stayed drafts easily one favorite rpgs like many others stopped playing awhile game stopped developing loooong time back development seems also steam great thought saw negative reviews decided take look anyway yeah f would take away experience skill tree system game good loved many needed content updates changes please fix game still love every aspect game except progression makes unplayable highly anticipated game alpha buyerafter playing beta im mixed feelings like game dont like design choices herei think wollay removed many rpg elements present alpha version taking away much core gamewollay basically made entirely new game exploration based game rpg like game alpha version wasthe main problems version region locking certain core elements paraglider boat stuff live dont really see gear region locked mean truly wanted every region start anew gear existoverall like game gets boring far early thats bummeri really hope game gets alot content updates future childhood game hearing coming back steam years made happybut played game graphics never fail impress level system means skills gear gets removed new biome enter matter beat lot dungeons get small permanent boost stats like sailing faster something along lines doesnt really make wanna keep going new biome play game general honestly released alpha version eurosbucks would happy play hours wasnt expecting bought game hoping would still stuff alpha add lots stuff creator posting twitter would recommend find way get alpha first ever serious review pains make thisi personally much say game alpha player always alpha playerdo take say heart personal opinioncube world game made today seeing game plumit amazing alpha half arsed beta hurts anything else waited years thisthe region lock immediately set tyrant game whole point huge game like explore gear understand drop rate possible zone luck godthe removal exp alright way level game something fond leveling requires artifacts give minimal boost utility combatfinally way wollay changed combat abysmal best change hurt game either keep distance ranged class die close combat class worse need exploit random allies region even slim chance harder enemies understand need fight white tier enemies become powerful alpha fight whatever wanted long skill kill itwollay please listen community want nothing best man hope things go well future seeing next mans sky right hurts soul see waymay game get better show true game meansedit also anyone wishes comment believe right thing game means alpha players explain greatest moment playing cube world indefinitely unfinished developer abandoned even get fixed chances years time download alpha version much better well tough one genuinely believe game potential comparing version game infinitely better completely different direction played lot cubeworld back day past self would incredibly happy came update gamein playtime ive already good moments walking house immediately blown witches flying lakes lava trying obtain item discovering lore falling incredible world createdthat said couple problems main issue game region locks equipment every time travel new region equipment lost start scratch understand mechanic implemented try add longevity peoples playtime massive amounts content interesting topic look kept equipment wouldnt necessarily always feel need complete regions new regions may feel boring however losing equipment warning kind slap face experience felt like reason lose equipment would fine happens abruptly seemingly reasonanother con starting never fight creatures every enemy way strong fight even basic sheeps pigs curbstomp least make life incredibly difficult needs way balance enemies spawn areas least offer interesting ways fight hired help joining current npc party anything reallyproswell world generation overall feel game outstanding far improved cubeworld play multiplayer longer wander endless realms trying meet bootleg server instead servers hosted steam stable able fast travel friends region game irl cost unlockable equipment fun use changes experience based many pieces equipment havethe design creatures game general fun creativei genuinely think playing game squad friends best way go could get lot value playing others especially groups kind game problem games accomplish well better think game fun cdn funi appreciate work put steam im hoping well see consistent updates roll one games keep eye may best start love devs game amazing know jump cubeworld cubeworld steam astounding proves itll keep getting better thinking getting game would warn would also encourage get think youd like feel title stands currently direction going im sure year ill able fully recommend game anybody though recommend game moment like style concept felt unnecessarily difficult gear low level land seemed sparse mobs anywhere within decent distance starting area would one shot serious balancing needs done keep eye possibly purchase future refunded wollayi recommend game reason people give bad reviews alpha back different like look core concepts different actually pretty intriguing think changes game could almost perfect okay weapons didnt region lock think game would really lot better better fan base go new region stuff becomes really bad changed think players would like game lot added skill tree back alpha think players would like would like way tooso people think new artifact leveling sucks think skill tree level get points skill tree combined stuff talked think people would genuinely enjoy love game fromjordan players got game cant refund like meyou dun got robbed go play alpha lot better anyone wants short yes never played alpha game fantastic recommend love open world exploration rpg even roguelikescube world changed lot honestly better alpha incredibly boringand anyone owned game time ago would know cube world years away hasevolved changed relatively complete game features although may dislike inthe end likely better game never us helping achieve passion payed six years ago buying game supporting development nice enough give us game alpha always subject change honest would eat cereal however format chick strip placement completely horrible first nobody wanted cut grass know im going buy hot dog spaghetti sauce isnt good dont eat dog simple idea nobody seems understand nearly impossible come across lawn grass due locking species environment however help metal straws visco way situation honest actually love game even new changes hope gets updates enjoy iti deffinitly find game way better played multiplayer though adds life adventure honest like game seems like im one likes changes features final version dont know people expected wanted fun little game pass time nothing less nothing honestly dont feel like needed thumbs begin play alpha first became popularthis game endless potential super fun even current state voxel art done quite beatifully true description exploration based rpg enjoyed alpha much even though somewhat lower end optimization beta release seems better optimized seems much less issues however larger quests many particle effects lower frame rates overall find release game represent potential fun alpha compliment however may also seem worrying beta release represent years developmentoverall game fun dont know worth current state every piece game overwhelming potential time misses mark bit example game could addictingly fun grind world warcraft even legend zelda games could game best friends group grind quests battle hordes bosses get awesome loot well already problem often online desync huge problem multiple friends game another problem progression quests understand game focus exploration way track quests really even get npcs make start game rough top starting extremely challenging everything encounter potential oneshot youallinall leaving positive review however would recommend wait either sale dev show true palpable followthrough paid game years ago could barely play due optimization constantly looking updates optimization dev go mia years beta optimized much better lacks true additional substance fact took things alpha players liked game fun could bestselling game developer isnt committed wollay dont screw much changed alpha able enjoy enjoyed alpha probably wont enjoy beta put bluntly good rpg almost like counter rpg systems place make suffer items locked regions youre punished exploring imagine open world rpg punishing exploring leveling removed items way get stronger wouldnt problem however drop rates horrible often get items class also monsters far powerful far weak theres somehow zero inbetween finally music repetitive offers little varietyi wanted good cube world youre recommend everyone stay away start absolutely loved alfa version cube world put many hours developing character better better years looked wollays twitter random things game sure would ever release us play always hoped day would excited hear announcement update finally happening put time game things really dont like progression system doesnt keep interested going new area loose everything got last dont like find glider boat etc made sense get enough gold buy skill character use skills beginning game much better progressively tried get skills leveling combat system doesnt work good remember alfa version long boss fights barely would hang end skill would beat boss almost highest armor highest weapon star bosses still shot make smallest mistake especially true mage bosses shooting shouldnt happen built armor actually fight guys also start weak lucky like got star weapon early enemies felt way easy way soon blasting way around without even talking npc system get clues doesnt work good finished lot quests hours going around trying get clues nothing happened random npc finally gave clue reigns pets hours finally went another biome talking npc area gave clue artifact dungeon biome trying complete npcs waste time talk feel like treasure hunt see npc finally give something valuable besides much like shoeswollay completely changed game ground everything thought coming twitters changed point cant recommend game current state hope hear respond constructive criticism want best game ever wollay start youve played alpha game nothing like rememberif expected alpha build years polish isnt according wollays drip tweets completely rebuilt version made two years plays like roguelite progression entirely tied gear gear find region depowered upon moving another region one consider region run speak completed fully upon completion gain upgrades degrees permanence bring outside regionwhile would personally prefer classic rpg exp system alpha along fact made decision pay years ago would like emphasize find nothing inherently wrong system gripes gameplay cycle currently implemented cycle currently looks something like travel combat upgrade travel issues former two skill trees removed along skills characters every stage effectively four moves combat limited movement options made combat incredibly shallow compared alpha unfun subjective opinion monsters long drop exp rarely anything meaningful two coins reason moving across world means really travelling picking plants avoiding fights sucks youre going wind spending literal hours strolling point point boverall would recommend current build anyone assuming price remains usd initial grind get game awfully boring payoff efforts isnt much better try simplify feelings words possible feel like core gameplay mechanics fun however games progression system feels entirely unrewarding artifacts arent worth gathering provide small benefits exclusion point time would change nothing progression system think region locking could work artifacts significantly changed game play experience beneficial player actually felt rewarded spending however many hours get one otherwise youre simply repeating steps visible character growth obviously isnt issue game game new content since alpha though significantly less expected originally detailed roadmap new music example aspect enjoyed lot feels zeldaesque mean massive compliment core progression system area flaws still fun cube world got worth way back alpha stage cant recommend game current state character hour mostly simply got bored first region game lasted around hours alpha stage lasted far less beta stage many bugs worth imo many game play connectivity issues enjoy game much running travel items work zones gathered makes exploring new biome fun run around unpolished focusing exploration exploration often talk everyone see get locations open map mark locations manually go lowest quest highest element surprise makes exploration aspect feel unexcitingthe combat fun gets repetitive fast character classes offer shallow variety cant help make game diverse end also blame enemies dont really much else shooting afar running slash youthe progression artifacts permanently improve exploration stats swimming speed lamp radius etcthe region lockregion bound items nice touch could work great landscapes biomes structures good make places feel uniquetldr since noticeable character progression combination lack excitement exploring game gets old quite fast cant recommend sadly took wollay years make game worse impressive achievement took hours get used new mechanics would recommend eagerly look forward future updatesedit guess wrong check six years took already contentdevoid experience removed aspects game alpha infinite leveling scaling system least gave sense progression regionlocked gear taken away thing sticks regions artifacts marginally increase movement stats really noticeable fashion unfortunately game broken always likely due developers history mental health issues im saying people harass guy try force finish game actually finish game take parts game slap also disingenuous people purchased product say finished best thing wollay could game sell another company run core product finish line promised seems unlikely forgetting game existed tons us played alpha years ago came flocking back hope game would finished unfortunately feels even less developed alpha years ago took hours gear got geared figured get er done im fun purchaser alpha back really happy see game come everyone try even quite different alpha thats obviously expected got moneys worth top notch bought alpha phase glad gotten far torturing game first hour gets better finding first weappon stars ist really good end region recive surprize game hours start new region prepared torture specially ocean start boat levels artifacts useless game made exclusively coop get items classes meaning items get useless solo play recommended yet lot grow total failure even worth totally shite better ealrier ngl doesnt worth even simply remove region lock add old lvling trashalso people giving game good review good mods sensible travel takes long real way make quicker even shrine teleport system even traveling shrine destination feels slow traveling somewhere new feels even slower xp resetting progression makes feel like new character time makes feel like theres reason play real reward mostly anything game makes feel empty feel reason actually play game half playing game walking towards next unknown point interest might even inaccessible high level actually realistically able complete disregarding past game development dont think game fun worth money right main reasons long travel time noextremely little consistent character advancement trove better freechange mind trove probably fun point truly good game seeing games development made clear much work developers put game fun exploration biomes problem people agree biome equipment lock thing start isnt bad get third fourth biome thing start getting bit repetitive still good game specially multiplayer sadly didnt get much experience steam launch yet trying really hard enjoy shouldnt like removing alpha progression systems biggest mistake devs ever make maybe ignoring community running away reality time tell trying give neutral standpoint since lot people purchased back alpha versionseeing game comparing anything else prior rednitionsits fun hours realize start bonusesleftovers besides artifacts feel like playing hours start scratch new game experience something along lines climbing tiny bit faster sailing bit faster go youre looking rpg actual progression cube world game twenty bucks like grind like clicking mouse occasionally mouse constantly concerned healing items game covered excitement mmo combat system none subscription feessass aside missed shot interesting concepts progression missed target might come back revisit devs touch overall dont think worth wait maybe time two quick points front id like thank dev taking project completion game isnt terrible compelling reasons recommendcube world best summed zeldainspired exploration game minecraftstyle graphics progression gear based progression resets change regions exception gear still works surrounding regions zone unlock mobility items explore complete quests complete dungeons get artifacts mildly increase mobility item stats mostly nothing combat relatedthe good runs smoothly system brand new top end looks great assuming like art style great sense discovery explore first zone replayability trying character classesthe bad difficult early progress best bet dragging enemies wandering npcs hoping drop useful weapon luck based progression may get top tier weapon walking two npcs fighting right start may struggle couple hours trying get upgrade telling happen classes unbalanced classes obvious way sustain battle others easy assuming gear answer kindofnotfun region locking gear mechanism get gear luck relatively rare quest crafting alternate way add would help progression compelling reason play finishing first region exploring adjacent areas youve hopefully found weapon bonuses artifacts helpful core gameplay little reason pursue seeing biomes real reason continue thats compellingsummarydespite full release still feels like demonstration shell could lack endgame luck based awkwardly limited progression system limited unbalanced class choices stand things holding game back buy game expect initial fun followed wondering could better design decisions update game abandoned dev ran away money buyi would wait buy game see developer adds stuff game hours gameplay seen done everything repeat stuff meaningful

shown twitter scrapped lackluster release developer isnt communicating playerbase reasoning behind decisions madetldr game worth state uhh yeah release different game used still enjoy itfor every time switch regions get addicted game want clear everything lol unfinished likely never finished whats worth price stay away unfortunately im going downvote game imagining would definitely change back recommend current state fun unfortunately impossible look amount playtime previous version game played almost addictively years years many included looking forward update already wonderful game already great needed tiny balance changes content update simply thatso much old charm removed sense accomplishment gone ill say world lot features feels alive actual game content next none compared truely shamei know theres things going wolfram wife mental health issues however much ask dev able take critique loyal community waited half decade moment people uttered critique hid shut posts gone dust leaving community regret waited longi still hopeful one day theyll come back one day game gets deserves many games try mimic style already taken spot unfortunately alpha progression pile disappointment fun couple hours realize cant anything anymore youre maxed gear skills levels basically anything grind unfortunately core gameplay loop lacks sort long term replayability plenty bugs lot grindy time wasting mechanics believe dev ever return fix issues people game cant good faith recommend current state manage find copy alpha much enjoyable experience unfortunately cubeworld currently stands years neglect noncommunication game removed many great gameplay aspects used cannot fathom developer would gut game like done huge disservice fanbase thumbs unfortunately simply cannot recommend game loved cube world alpha wollay made many questionable design choices continue support passion project say isnt amazing guy amazing developer game designer much harder say rip cube world much potential end could deliver unfortunately alpha version significantly better rewarding play understand want make new zone enter challenging essentially breaking gear obtained another zone including means travel like rafts makes progress made game feel like massive waste time everything receive essentually useless exploring new zones continents never felt punishing unfuni hope someday somebody mods game something good years waiting culminating bones amazing adventureexploration game game lacks much way design intuitive gameplaycontrols well character progressionworld buildinggame design unfortunately game didnt deliver much promised game bland playing makes depressed good couldve instead get play breath wild even devs didnt respond anything forums full banhappy mods unfortunately far cry promised game ended utter disappointment every time move new area might well started new character lose everything items stick around couple extra areas doesnt help overall problem hopefully things get fixed recommend game friends moment case unfortunately version cube world seems less finished alpha version region locked gear adventure game additionally complete zone move next basically restarting game unless gear start zone scratch end quests eventually start another zone thing unfortunately wasnt worth wait game largely still feels like early access game vanished years ago bare bones also weird progression system added version pretty bad effectively ruins open world nature game put way time old early access release one released years ago maybe would recommended hope perhaps would improve release point id pass especially price little game changed half decade since first popped current design game general doubt game changing updates pipeline shame unless rewards leveling get better game wont much hours gameplay people gear unusable part cross biome border keep artifacts level fine system issue artifacts give small boosts swimming speed handgliding speed ect nothing make next biome go different experience really cant recommend game current stage much prefer alpha stage game completely honest fix progression though abolutely amazing title unless theres huge update progression system game huge waist money time unless youre playing group friends game definitely worth playing progressing biomes rewarding frustrating artifacts ought give bonuses unplayable coop graphical lag every seconds years ago game still problems worth max recommended normal price creators create mix alpha beta content killing mobs gives exp dont lose stats gear moment go neighboring region unless got even works continent youre wont reccomend game unless like starting whenever go new biomedid fun hours playing game yes point activity many times repetitively realize youre getting small bonus restartingbut prefer alpha version game way killing mobs finding loot disappear moment go ocean biome try get island ocean boat youre using speed across ocean disappears instantly biome changewollay pixxie love games guys got know changes years didnt text alpha beta people care game listen us help us create game everyone loves cubelike rpg games game fall love withif game ever gets updated true anymore write updated review likely change recommendation version get giant update worth time even update months release felt time give game second chancesadly little changed since devs unforgivably silent regarding many issues gameit clear unexpected comeback wollay quick cashgrab going radar bottom line cube world poorly designed deeplyflawed game could fixed creators instead decided release halfbacked version promising project done itothers explained better would game disappointment moment make shorti bought alpha cube world back really happy alpha really enjoyable stable already confident wollay would able make version game even better futuresadly notwhile cubeworld improved many aspects years also mess many ways stripped away major mechanics many planned features missing seemingly abandonedi unhappy current state game lack character progression repetitive gameplay loop unbalanced difficulty name issues happy update review positive way development take better direction update years making removes everything fun original alphadont buy update downgrade superior alpha years ago exp skill trees exploration tools hangars ships etc taken away upon entering new region gear loses stats entering new regionthese three changes ruined game hope something changes future either mod update update dev started talking promising removed features return well promised features alpha days beginning review stay sake maintaining current position note review subject change promised future games promised content removed core game substantially changed worse since alpha old road map game deleted lot promising stuff want full list things social media showed heres reddit want original road map google developers policing image uploaded reddit game currently state cannot recommend region locking ruins whole experience forcing gear removed enter new area ever show region even region lock special gear helps transportation boat suddenly disappearing midway ocean astoundingly horrible design choice obviously tested game empty lifeless bland core leveling system removed true sense progression accomplished sure level finding relics provide minor movement boosts affect base stats except movement means characters progression locked gear thing lose entering new region combat skills still busted like mages laser shreds health anything current state game leaves little talk leave talk isnt good either promised update wollay said bringing back leveling system new skill tree promised races traits hes working dungeons big cities seems like game whole reworked though leave game negative review recommend game current state update think review changed positive update developers ran away money like years ago absolutely communication since release fiasco updates even deleted idea great stuff great current state pretty sad product missing tutorial ingame hints beta players dont expect anything different release day got killed rabbits cows hours day one devs explained look village get quests npcsquests quests nothing like proper quest system despite years long teasing system simply random events scattered around map doesnt matter get marked map npcs helps finding range killing mobs free npc simple basic things like simply finding place taking hang glider item doesnt help works pretty poorly doesnt give speed boost whole sense behind quests give player better equipment reward luckyleveling doesnt exist game least doesnt anymore thing developer sadly calls leveling without reason count artifacts find end dungeons artifacts give bonus movement speed swimming sailing riding etcafter finish region set travel nearby region starting almost zero except lucky enough find gear works neighbour regions upgrades got new adventure another region new pet companion movement upgrades artifacts general gear strictly region locked partly gets worse starting gear switch regions mechanic however sounds worse really weird first continue play realize almost visiting harder high level area games first time old gear interesting time could improved lot aspects point dont even keep boat glider instantly forget ride pet enter new regionthere almost none features teased past years release version skilltree levelsystem rename artifact level please level artifact count doesnt sense behind quest system also dont call got quest system random event thing reworked bare minimum could expect game otherwise pretty empty wide landscapes good also far enough dynamic experience motivation keep playing capital cities ocean regions got huge downgrade terrain oceans large empty enemies list goes ondespite kinda like game lot fun first hours day trying play mage without knowing pretty much feels like playing lot different zelda games right basically travelled hyrule hours trying finish quests dungeons first region still didnt know really made game stuff works started game twilight princess twice large region afterwards decided pause instead play game wind waker nearby ocean region really felt lot like playing wind waker sailing island island freeing region evil sorcerer unlock last dungeon region huge graveyard island fight challengers huge arena finally continue twilight princesslike adventurebut thats pretty much although currently quiet fun dont think anyone permanently fun game long term without getting disappointed bored one main aspects cube world back even year ago developer somehow suddenly removed everything worked always teased sporadically features fans alpha players ilovedi past months strangely decided give us instead neither anyone paid back anything dream vision developeryou try argue want fact developer wrote lists exactly passion project supposed games inspired planned dont work dream years without releasing anyone updating basic alpha decide oh know actually dream exactly basic starting point years ago restrictions without core mechanics already released worked lets release first let quickly downgrade terrain generation use level display artifact counter also know buying alpha way ifinancingi supporting development game exactly usual way ibuyingi game honestly makes even worse thats excuse money finance development formerly great projectexactly almost nothing actual end product see result today fact finished product meant saleso despite kinda liking played beta fun cant recommend game people except people two specific people exactthis started good turned bad years good inbetweens turn full offensive like bad prank last second people including still hoped beta joke partly built beta purpose testing terrain generation item system release important core mechanics official release turns intention punch everyone face right start personally didnt even play alpha couple minutes pc bad itat point isnt acceptable behavior anymorethe communication devs poor non existent people screaming answers everyday get nothing instead many almost randomly selected steam forums moderators abused system locked lots threads proper criticism new mechanics even ipositivei posts got locked straight deleted people tried bash developer negative comments provocation purposes thats happened feedback process beta one supposed help developer improve product fix bugshonestly development beta release cube world huge disappointmentcube world went surprise decade years development without updates except screenshots features never got released disappointment year regards gaming game huge development communication marketing financingdisasterit potential one best games

instagram expecting game update origional thought would like alpha content dissapointed find progressing game wasnt fun anymore used love game update ruined dont buy abandonware used play alpha wish would bring old features back really like new turn things id honestly say change would like current outlook making areas bit bigger bring back nice large detailed alpha landscapes back could also make mounts little useful utterly astonished update change beta produced vastly lesser game experience bland terrain compatibility issues inferior controls interface enemies sparse unrewarding general game feel directly compared predecessor lackingalpha owners able directly compare two games immediately notice direct downgrade disappointed also hopeful game fun promise failed execution vastly inferior alpha build gearregion mechanic god awful cut features left right theres less game years agoit might worth future idea expect thought good direction head inthis feedback testing important keeps committing years changes everyone going hate cool many wows cute fun game music pleasant exploration enjoyable disappointed part alpha beta hoping things would changed release game progression mess

around find creatures anything else hours find boat glinder stuff lot game began looks like beta began fun want explore go next zone restart zero almost boring feeling progress maybe wollay patch hope disappointing game rpg elements taken game fighting monsters feels empty top going new regions invalidates gear start procedural generation gone also beautiful game design decisions ruin game

procedural terrain top notch truly reminiscent retro gaming cube world leverages modern pc capabilities render large dynamic worlds music core gameplay also among favourites time rhythm fights effects

riding cant pass thats small increase wanna love game like old times cant making open world game punish us exploring taking gear multiple times day isnt fun see idea fare sucks upgrade u level ridiculously bad last thing make legendaries actually rare want boat vanishes middle ocean entered new regionwant find gear tha rusts away entering new regionwant get one shoted slimeswaspscows entering new regionwant receive artifacts levels dont improve combat ability movement ability boat glider find every regionin general like stuff without anything feels like actual reward progressionwell game youin personal opinion game punishing exploring fell reward anything already felt repetetive pointless hoursthere good things looks music pets boat glider multiplayer lot fun still quite enough put problems minimap quite brilliant honestbut long dev doesnt fix games problems least fine tune gameplay loop fun rather go back playing cube world alpha wanted love game much harder leveling get lucky finding high rarity weapon class use half time end getting gear cant use opinion alpha way enjoyable im still holding onto hope wollay add levels back game make game enjoyable alpha want able reccomend game friends right people save money clear indication fixed wanted make game exploration ruined concept exploration adding region locked gear items bought alpha back always imagined would like complete cube world experience isnt huge fan alpha version bummer become pretty fun game little worse alpha still enjoyable bug decided let play anymore review mostly asking help boot game screen becomes white instantly crashes ive backed data uninstalled reinstalled game restarted steam several times nothing probably corrupted file would mean id restart hours progress alpha player remember game much fun although may little different base game compared played back day lot less bugfree good starting point updates come game right ive honestly much fun playing grinding friends im glad made multiplayer much easier set easily invite friend two clicks button although spawn absolutely miles away easily meet game using flight master nearest villagehowever something would like see better level ups mount riding speed lamp light range increases maybe upgrades weapons could carry zone zone even weapons could carry zone zone abilities skill trees would awesome time maybe even mechanics comes mobs fighting themdespite fact game could better future game damn good play ive really enjoyed far amazing game alpha regular update plan game could mastapiecee world currently fairly empty skills populate liven world randomness maybe check progression system maybe give player way change world well good luck awesome awesome fun first switch regions gear regionlocked artifacts arent worth grinding since upgrades provide trash overall enjoyable long run fun play little became boring quick good early alpha years ago turned shit worth pricetag good lasted guess still worth shot great alpha sucked brought beta released steam gameplayruining mechanics really hinder progress isnt much collecting items years ago still enjoy hyped let first hour gameplay boring refundedi really wanted like game cant worth year wait great longer still fun viewed singlestand alone game really fun ruined super excited game come without rpg elements alpha theres real sense progression restarting new region non combative passive exploring world interesting would worth restarting thinking get back game somehow game back first version instead improving last version recommending new updates comes get back stage suppose watch reviews browse subreddit buy game make sure something might enjoypersonally believe flawed ways one comparing alpha though may enjoy new systems implemented nevertheless game far cry completed gotta hope wollay actually fix underlying problems actually take experience purchase game grain salt watching paint dry fun costs less money way back supported alpha game ton fun playing beta full release ive much even sure may skill tree exp bar pet thirst dunno changes ive seen good ones far new stuff thats put questing better map locations zones separate equipment never stop improving good maybe well eventually see skill tree return besides dont think feel like anything missing even doesnt im happy weve got great work bringing us fun game time wollay knew version totally different alpha wollay said negative reviews pile love game wollay keep good work peace need cube world alpha steam far superior crap never got promised ages ago wanth xp system back game without xp system like pokemons without pokemons main part missing weapon based progression cool idea locking items single region could interesting although would hard make put two together pretty much get rid permanent progression game hope wollay comes back pulls mans sky game theres much showed last years arent game big cities pirates updated leveling system etc never made release current state youre hoping something akin alpha id say look somewhere else doesnt really hold wonder want time waster play listening podcasts something give shot guess game changed might change review current state cant recommend weeeeeeeeellmy english much controversy game fun short best friends partner start little tough come alpha dont expect start equally hard theres plenty bugs creators seems missing disappeared previously years dont expect improvement music great though nice filler current price much recommend beacuse nostalgia weird progression game pretty neat welcome cube world hope dont like exploring well alpha really good back day beta leaves much desired think new leveling system new unique levels dont mean anything game doesnt progression system stuff resets enter new area areas arent big theyre pretty small unless want run around chunks whole game experiencing town different mobs area youre going get benefit glider boat good weapons artifacts worse part boats glider disappear leave area warning like oceans count area like boats kind worthless game atm dont really know say wollay us first half gonna lie game good well mean werent art style wouldnt belive gamei mean combat system good wasand region system ughits laggy takes load render things compared grafics alpha lag less old pc skill tree like artifact idea less end game thingmaybe level system doesnt increase speed arifacts could increse attack hp similiar thingsit would okay new game developers sure want game didnt know make game fun players waited years worse experience well still fun playing pokemon pets doesnt worth euro well im never buying game fella worked ever againpart still hoping update game itll probably never happen well played cube world alpha exited forgot heard news coming disappointed reason old one great could go anywhere get better regions youre free understand wanted make feel diffrent wasnt worth wait well waited years release im statisfied endproducti mean yeah chill fun game relax play buddies problem cube world game mechanics first ther regionbound items features become totally useless like crafting upgrading gear doesnt rlly feel right run around totally useless items find legendary drop first min new regionthe second big problem cube world nearly progression whats ever go new region grind gear get useless artefekt repeatin conclusion fun becomes repetetive hours well sayi completely forgot cubeworld lack updates years ago moved thinking would never touched get email saying cubeworld released steam update excited download right away try alpha testers beta wow say years somehow managed make worse region locking gear bad idea makes feel like arent progressingnow people going say difference fighting stronger opponents becoming weaker fighting opponents well doesnt answer sentence alone let lay getting weaker progression makes character progressing might say well difference starting whole new character playing character progression dont say oh get artifacts along region locking gear also region locks movement abilities probably wouldnt mad gear thing movement wasnt region locked get boat mounting ability parasailing ability nuisance isnt fun especially since either randomly find randomly hope get quest shows opinion would better unlock first unlocked go one easy find obelisk reunlock movement found one dev roadmap im sure google find ease new promised features many alpha players hoping years honestly expecting bring gutted version alpha way looks like dev trying make another run peoples money disappearing another years reanouncing different platform get even money hopefully im wrong actually care community change game update accordingly like mans sky turned around became great gameto wrap one go region locking gear lazy way tiers gear make levels gear make reset would recommend game stands hope seeing reviews wollay change better progression system add features promised years ago well worth wait cube world intellectual move forward old one love change exploration based good mechanics round good game cant wait explore well first thanks continuing work game years appreciate even things players want moment like added game far mobs npcs fast travel system nice able play friends steam also nice vs someone host server see lot people happy leveling system region locking items said working team game easy dont lot people bounce ideas ideas seemed good time made see community likes dislikes improve upon like class changes agree exp brought back skill trees always add flare game like new spells abilities tank actually able tank new dungeons nice rouges snipers cant sneak way end get treasure understand though region lock good idea wouldnt much challenge grinding first biome legendary looted mind maybe could add increased difficulty increase level way keep difficulty dropping offall still like game excited see improvements make future thanks wollay well years expected dont think bad lot worse would say lot mechanics definitely feel like result one guy developing game bubble years understand lot people dont like time machine think would still buy game alpha well least pretty colors well since game coming tommorow since apart beta program feel inclined give review highly anticipated andor skeptical releasecube world wonderful blockyrpg game filled monsters quests basically infinitely sized world along infinite progressioni remember buying alpha went middle school im graduate high school understatement saying bought alpha waited little bit got brilliant taste game wait several years game reality different game thought wasthe alpha expbased progression current game switched ibp itembasedprogressionthis good badthe problem lot people associated exp cube world used alpha removing exp resulted completely different feeling game play also removed lot incentive kill random enemies rather hope rng give items even usehoweverthis progression potential quite great biggest concern work hard items less gets taken away leave region slightly faster glide speed longer diving time big problem cube world incentive real justified incentive progress one wants take hours complete one region able glide faster cant even immediatly glide switch regions immediatly weak beginning demoralizing results short oneanddone experienceif perhaps artifacts gave us satisfaction made us feel really improving would fun turn slaying enemies incentive navigated large regions would also fun engaging expierience maybe instead single piece gold maybe food could bigger item pool likescaled enemy ranklevelgold including buffsmaps unexplored dungeons villages region even treasurei think cube world would really benefit working game mechanics make sense provide incentivehowever truly brilliant game believe great potential think tons fun playing developers hard work feeling turn fantastic game entire community proud well begin destroyed exploring sense game cant really explore anymore leave biom youve grinded tried get good gear youll lose sense worth nothing lets say legendary sword one biom sword would like common lvl sword another dont get wrong love every aspect cube world fact everything made small little cubes sounds art characters crafting pets love everything still remain old cube world cube world alphasooo dont get game know good old cube world disappointed dont get game value memories old one least want keep nostalgic feeling thanks well would one expect years silence worth buy well hearing news hour wrote weeks late missed midnight beta release cube world coming alpha phase onto steam positively thrilled honestly jumping excited dumped countless hours alpha loved every minute read reviews read forums others thought immediately shot right disbelief feels people liking cube world possible even anticipation revival got steam key installed found first hand didnt even put much time although still cube world really cube world get games change creators different ideals creation might turn though scrap already amazing mix almost endless progression challenging skill based combat grandioso exploration make region bases grind ill never figure nothing goes new regions start skills unlocked dont earn xp traditionally rpg gear turns hot garbage eventually sell leave region start grind map fully revealed everybody longer procedurally generated world rts fow like reveal explore travel flight master anywhere map long gold quests new places explore actual game progress ill still playing always love game however every minute played kicking screaming garbo version cleaned replaced real cube world first put wolmeister well say different people saying ask game worth right hmmm plan play friends maybe yes playing friends disconnect things make game good enough either way id wait see future cube world maybe game itll change maybe enjoyable way game today well couple hours might get tired running around stuff anyway wait little buying ok wellthe different classes nice soon change region whole progress zero shame arent listening community well worth wait simple answer wasnt tip avoid game altogether welp game update best game ever played understand happened wollay lead scrapping whole design starting instead fixing bugs adding new features none matters though beta full release hopes still high game sure wollay pixxie initially come agreement community restore main part game way back thensupportlxtus went fun gun like years ago watered version today went great alpha huge potential shell alpha version bravo wollay look forward hearing years went great game trove somehow worse actual happened game every feature alpha people liked removed replaced systems make gameplay sense buy scam like game open world relaxing play cube world want play game walk runwhat dont like region lock boat one area suddenly gone another areaits also missing experience bar skill tree fun collect artifacts level upi hope developers bring back experience bar skill tree removce region lock future update cube world isnt fun like thisi advice buy cube world big year disappointmentthe devs almost couldnt picked directions take development would ruined game morei sure aiming less mmo grindy experience try stand way game stands unbelievably wrong gonethere absolutely zero progression acceptable fun losing things changing zones brainless idea could ever come seriously whythe version fun disappointment alpha excellent needed progress beta justdisappointing much else say fantastic wee big game garbage system game adventure punishes adventure treat buyer beware love game walk first zone realize garbage game letdown backed alpha better version developer choose commuicate anymore knows ever updateddont buy scam lol happened years happens truest used amazing game potential happened game past years games creator promising great things released thisif want hear whether game worth purchasing posting absolutely literally playing meaningless game nothing shiny loot drops good zone dropped motivationhowever cause game came recently may get much needed updates ill give two cents experienced far gamemy prosfor game based exploration pretty fast paced travelling around without mounts etc doesnt feel horrible movement feels smooth combat wastes time figure outcome quicklyalmost anything isnt considered humanoid giant tamed means tame simply grind treats figure pet likes treatswhile lacking compared back class based system gives meaningful variety like weapons deciding attack choice two subclasses determine movement options ultimate ability havemy consyou read everyone else youll read games relevant means progression gear based heavily rng reliant could take minutes find something amazing practically never find good weapon early rest zone becomes much joke dont think even kids enjoy itother means getting gear like buying crafting tied behind finding crafting books saving suppliers zoneboats mounts gliders convenient tied finding zone sadly makes hasslebosses feel like regular enemies healthzones really lacklusterloot travelling options key items crafting gear zoneboundzones smallyour actual means progression tied behind artifacts zonebound increase means get around zones slightly faster diminishing returns boottheres lot could point would rather wait month two giving depth review game release honestly better hasnt already said please make zoom inzoom somethingplease dont take away movement options like hangglider every regionplease make artifacts unique reward doesnt fit grindplease talk us wollay dont take negative criticism heart use better project done cube worldi dissapointed dont know went wrong thought game better lot things change even worsethe hud broken cant see everything trading using inventorythe combat unbalanced meet bee times stronger beggining seriousall legendary items skills stuff weird uncomfortable idea group ogres chilling forest next village well big strong kill player one hit spawning fast often villages poor maybe pumpkins corn fields flowers grass still feel like could houses empty find inside bed table chair wardrobe carpet flower sometimes npcs boring dont say anything interesting repeating favourite pet fire beetle well thats awesome mister say something else sometimesthe classes unbalanced example warrior much stronger archer water mage op class understand difference big combat game annoying sometimes mage meet group enemies impossible keep distance get anyway enemies fast stupid fight hard boring iti know things wrote beggining game thats point game better know things needs changed destroying gameplay look coins collecting system annoying tooalmost everything game bad unfinished im starting think wollay wife get money disappear forever wish wrong looks like im right considering fact responding againif like game understand like gives nostalgia love graphics music amazing atmosphere great still play probably really hope important things change future cube world thriveim really sad good thought would maybe future change rating really hope soyou shouldnt buy waste money good god thinking bro new players need understand alpha cube world progress alongside fleshed combat system means actually stood something need hope youre lucky enough either cheeseball higher level mob clear higherlevel chest find one hidden around areaand prepare potential render useless next area downgraded repeat process next extremely similar areaalphaheads would rather leveling crafting gear stand something alongside promised arealeveling systems teased twitter elsewhere system get doses yay gets oldmodding veloren dosince wol wont fuck used good steam like years ago manage nothing years fuck hell happened game point region locking system bad system goes game entirely remove system think game would lot better please please please bring back exp system things done could easily recommend game current state recommend staying far away game game needed beta alpha hat fell love available public different game promised different even hardcore fans trouble find motivation keep playing wollay needs release option play alpha rules much like runescape old school whats feeling demo years ago fun play full game oh ya disappointment cube world first came bought right away loved beta love even bought alpha supporting idea thought game potential hopeful idea would grow something truly great didnt happen impressive demo game never fully realized time move bought game alpha good time moved life wasnt mad wasnt counting days overall pleasant surprise see come backthe game current state certainly isnt everyone lacks lot depth long term nonetheless good time second time around believe game watch potential though repugnant infantile reaction much community might cause wollay ghost us wouldnt blame fair say cube world somewhat overpriced say im hoping future updates justify providing constructive criticism retrieved sea angry gamersothers pointed new levelling system leaves something desired due start gear whenever reach new zone particular find artifacts impactful considering theyre main persisting form progression throughout adventure really would expect something interesting eg glider speed player needs incentivised thoroughly explore zone however none changes alpha really worth throwing doritos pram fortaking beautiful relaxing game fairly easy pick playing friends makes better fun discover new things game mechanics exploration decent diversity customisation races subclasses weapons pets easily sink many hours game enjoy exploration sake got game alpha rough could see good game burried could amazing years later feels like minimal progress made anything design decisions moved bad direction really hope turns something good theres lot interesting ideas unpolished initially bought cube world alpha quickly realized essentially playing tech demo decided shelf wait got update fast forward six years game still doesnt feel less like tech demo fact feels imorei like one current state cannot recommend cube world graphics nice unique overall game design appear well thought time waited game reach full release many masterpieces created legend zelda breath wild slay spire like open world games friends wanna kill time id say go though theres many options exist well otherwise hopefully see game updated along community feedback reach better point download mods enjoy game paid sad heard cube world full release bad discuraged playing recently decided give shot anyways purchased alpha back got free even region lock im loving game play friends makes everything much fun alpha game great downgradet version alpha really playable download mods dont well wont play much maybe clear zones deinstall game game first came loved blast playing friends time went game became less less fun wasnt fun anymore game first came would always want play years later game comes stoked play got still fun remember watching playing thing go new area start new thing game really good hope wolley update least everything else great oh also wolley adds bank transfer items another character friend basically borderlands inventory pinging game released years ago shell game almost gameplay one thing great fucking idea game rereleased safely say game beautiful game bootif describe kind game would say like minecraft breath wild botw wow combined given legacy three game would imagine game new innovative addictive former would right might asking breath wild like games straightforward comparison minecraft random gen art style wow fantasy setting dungeoneering botw well gliding climbing even though accurate comparison would rather compare number little things around map like botw treasure spirit opinion great idea spirit helps make travelling location location much enjoyable scratching surface comes shit world would like added cause fuck might like game beginning bad job explaining get discouraged figure game blast similar minecraft idea fuck would hate throws world context survive well thats exactly case cube world please give game chance might enjoy even missing lot standard conventions present mmos would also recommend playing many friends cross boarder feel like northkorean go wrong used much fun trash progression antifun mechanics even begin whole situation bloody messas writing review game released alpha backers playing game weekthis game going years without update respectful towards backers developer suffered lot pirating attack extremely violent comments initial launch back go details clearly shows severely hurt soon psychologist see impact violence people devastating especially perfectionnist personnalities led wollay redo huge portion game doubti one enjoy game mechanics find really frustrating especially lack significant long term goals appreciate removal xp level bound gear enjoy gameplay enemies locations feeling adventurethe development history game could definition unfair hype game disappeared finally back whole years later people went crazy expectations unrealistic granted current version game feels like things removed thus experience lessened far know thats expected alphas betasyou may like game may wish hope receives updates sure way developping game pretty bad humble opinion communication would gone looong waybut please remember human poured heart game maybe think much demanded keep going personal attacksit excuse bad practices removal negative posts forums instanceof course review game negatively absolute right thats want hope little review help judge things bit clearly anything fun part begin happened gamethis monstersized disappointment especially compared alpha skill tree remove level system game feels even emptier years ago alot features made game super fun gone hope fix start someone bought alpha game years ago waiting time cube world release happy say product worth adventure rpgs charm offer beautiful world play though isnt game offers enough progression play consistently years bright side however could minor tweaks think come game time bottom line opinion contemplating buying game pay enjoy hours current state bit hope progression tweaked way makes game hour experience rather hour one absolutely fun hours played game ill agree majority prerelease gamer region locked equip right way keep us entertained long makes feel like whole progress made absolutely nothing goes changing regions though youre playing area really feel progress find good equip point take boss like mobs without getting stomped hitthe game needs changes agree wholeheartedly recommend game hope much fun playing c understand people upset things turned still think game good however hope doesnt discourage wollay improving game addressing everyones concerns maybe im looking rose tinted glasses game always special place heart honestly feel fixedimproved simple changes may exactly hoping still enjoy game nonetheless recommend game think needs improve bit one improvement would reinstatement leveling system thoroughly enjoyed cubeworld past still much odds region lock relics found actually gave meaningful stat boosts think region locking would felt satisfying comes earning upgrades big change alpha game still brilliant new game blast played alpha consider completely new game blast good time killer cube world downgrade alpha many feels like waited long game could much clearly need improvements fun exploring growing understand kind direction wollay intended idea regionlocked gear effectively makes efforts nil im upset loss skill tree like idea artifacts effects amount effects could gained adjusted better sense permanent progressionif willing put issues aside suggest getting game different alpha game still plenty life hopefully updates future long live wolay understand someones issues region locked equipment find works well multiplayer everyone strength regardless many areas theyve cleared though movement speeds may differ leading entertaining situations also makes taking long break playing easier go new area continue never left shaking rust may varynot mention cant think many rpgs progression soley equipment based personally find quite refreshing flaws enjoyable game would recommend like pixel stylepersonal opinion like youre able play lizardman think pretty neat certainly different alpha expected game play ive enjoying quite bit nice play friends feel like youre level entering different region changed lot since alpha still like fun awhile first region get legendary gear complete region dosent take long hours less find legendary gear early isnt much else going another region restarts unless got gear region next takes hours upon hours grinding things region even days two grinding usually get green blue purple gear rarely one legendary gear even getting artifact even somehow main gear completely keep full strength neighboring region everything every region pretty much grass plains generic enemies dungeons quests get boat glider reins etc quickly becomes repetitiveif made crafted gear gear made gear region become gear mains artifact dungeons completed make grind go next region restarting complete beginning less grindy worth get new region isnt muchthat simply enable people able mod game let people make want reviews claims game unfortunately true still lot fun exploring beautiful landscape simple combat held quite would say still worth pickup least case study horizontal progression done almost right design choices questionable worth wait creator understandably gone dark due massive somewhat ignorant response many within existing fanbase modding community saving grace objectively game fun experience one exploration games actually enjoyed issues game lie three particular enough ingame assistance descriptions skills access classes choose etc many ui elements going menus crafting objects npc markers woefully unintuitive however difficult fix creator game continues work confidence eventually remedied also suggestion mr wollay npc important information give marker head said need say make marker disappear attempting talk variety uniquely named npcs spread town knowing whether got information available quite boring little anxietyprovoking regionlocking transport itemsi understand regionlocking bell flute harp act milestones completion region obtaining boat heading ocean region immediately lose boat awkwardly swim hours find another one fun player reason dont see games getting rid playerunlocked tools abilities imagine frustrating would play hollow knight hours suddenly lose dash ability method movement made player feel like progressing stripped away reason feel crippled frustrated gear regionlocked something understand like unique mechanic primary reason frustrated many people different alpha progression mean bad assure never play another game progression like cube world proposed fix vehicle problem spread multiple regions unlock permanently boat available first ocean region player enters glider available starting region climbing shoes available first snow region gives players incentive keep exploring even reset gear significantly longterm artefacts weakit takes many hours complete region permanent buffs receive reward insignificant mention half potential buffs get proven actually work current state game reward completing region feels like afterthought understand small bonus supposed incentivise longer investment game sheer amount time takes players reach point notice bonuses far long however one quickest fixes community honestly surprising gotta increase swim speed buff per artefact game breaking gives player sense noticeable improvement recommended fix make artefacts give stronger boosts make feel worthwhile explore regions also make artefacts bit valuable worth searching could make trade artefacts make item unaffected region locking provided regions move completed already way areas completed feel interconnected motivation players increase size territory powerful absolutely believe three relatively simple changes implemented reviews game would become mostly positive positive reader braved entire wall text thank would recommend hopping onto cube world reddit nexus mods getting cube world mod loader experiment different mods fix issues ive talked bought game openmind see potential fantastic memorable game changes could rolled months whether buy wait reaches point would pull trigger experience game despite negatives ive discussed game fun exploration great sound track unique interesting enemies great art world generation fun combatmy rating right changes implemented rating goes tips included game also take note potential buyers find town near spawn point talk npcs tell specific location item enemy marked map traversing completing quests progress start strong enough kill even weakest enemies primary goal explore search itemslocations staying hell away groups enemies spawn enemies give exp theres reason try grind start find couple pieces star gear start take star enemies small groups quests able clutch way better rewards stronger become change subclass guild master town change abilities eg rogue subclasses assassin ninja ninja focused speed assassin stealthremember kind guys remember game developed single person years slammed upon release show sympathy bur remember doesnt excuse criticism love game unconventionnal exp mechanism region locking know play actually quite satisfying complete every region finding methods get good gear fast rolling around get legendary weapon fair amount content musics simple nice wouldnt recommend youre hardcore fan old grinding level killing mobs system overall ill recommend would like try another way play rpg game isnt exactly everyone wanted release think still fun game would recommend friend gameplay combat feel clean youre game think would like reach peak cube world gameplay may wanna get mods reach exp idea game used progression system kinda wacc antiplayer game charming joy sink hours every despite problems exist still would highly suggest carefree fun game solid gameplay excluding things lot things nothing adds make feel like accomplished anything items reset region theres really overall goal game fun friends still relatively meaningless gameplay fun somewhat engaging several glitches online play interfere battles sometimes even singleplayer glitchy theres angry mob review bombing game paid product change view years ago knew nothing game maybe week launch say like pretty great isif youre looking game something know nothing well heres generally expect listdifficult fightszonespecific loot means always something never become god seemingly endless worldcrafting upgrade system optionaltaming petsmountslistif want game youre always able foot friend lot friends cant play time travel zone match gear level mine reset go definitely worth look like kind endless roguelikeexploration type game receiving lot negative reviews personally like game still one got game years ago much different dont think goodin regards still enjoy think negative reviews came people expecting alpha still think alpha regards better still think version perks much easier opinion get going first spawn one thing would like see changed though region locking gear done attempt make progression system would start new region see coming trying dont think right dont know solve without getting rid intention although still think try find way remove good dame couple flaws game wont everyones cup tea certainly isnt bad game ive found much enjoyment since accepting isnt exactly wanted enjoying youre fan roguelites youre going enjoy classic rpg fan zone essentially treated new game new run minimal arching progressionnew players hard time dont read guide difficult game understand color code system ranks powerqualitydifficulty enemies quests gear blue gear fight blue enemies blue quests doesnt help spawn gray gear even white enemies tough startthe art style lot carry game seeing creature explode pixels never gets old pets quite cute fun collect music good would like see sound tracks tracks become repetitivethe combat addicting personally feel combat felt smooth skill based alpha release feels gear matters skill still enough depth rate combat acceptable watching listening bosses use major abilities dodge common mechanic always seems make combat feel rewarding always exciting get stun water mage bit overpowered healing stream maybe made ultimatethe progression system hardest pill swallow game like said system reminds roguelite style game progress obtaining artifacts increase movement speeds gear plus mark end especially blue higher quality really valuable getting legendary plus weapon easily help carry though many zones gold also valuable type progression since saving suppliers easy way obtain lot gear zone strongest point game alpha current game exploration aspect feel ability zoom map somewhat takes away current game find exploring map screen mark locations instead traveling zone still run interesting things travel band npcs might tell new quest boss right level might drop upgrade may hear many people belittling game alpha dont let dishearten cube world amazing game still long way go gladly support whilst game definitely going get negitive reviews sould lookingat game unfinished beata six years agothis good game wanted still got game hope updates fix game loveable standardbut would call game investment im quite shure moding thingbut heard rumors lets hope get mods fix disliked thingsfor f makes amazing game decides showing everybody game goes dormant years decides completely destroy original game writing positive review may ask dont support wollay anymore anything hes jackass leaving us reason im writing positive recommending game future modders modders cube world hopefully going fix wollays disaster making game like alpha hopefully add new mechanics id wait weeks either comes hiding modders gonna fix game game potential bad game theres many features need rework content added keep faith modders make cube world great change gameconcept much take high risk insecure dont reply anything whole years alpha fine fun play new progression system trash satisfying basically restart game every time enter new biome idea skilltree thing pretty much everybody appreciates every mmorpg remove essential part game dont get make choices individualize character pathetic game game still lagging recommended specs still frames render distance feel scammed play game progress doesnt matterhope dont like exploration traveling everything reset trash moment leave zone got also lose nice tools like boat hanggliderso want see another zone make new character practically thingi wasnt lucky enough money years ago buy waited long time play couldnt disappointed tried god hope game goes back previous glory hold flicker hope wanted alpha exactly content restrictions pseudoinnovative stuff exactly loved much winrar better purchase wish game didnt region lock wish reason explore wish loot matteredits alpha wasim mad maybe listen community help make game everyone wants wish leveling system like earlier version still good game play wish like good game buy sale witcher far best game ive ever played geralt rivia favourite character medium wont go details game rpg fan play story excellent characters excellent atmosphere excellent world excellentalso cube world pretty crap dont play game play witcher instead group friends trying classes could probably get upwards hours rpg exploration fun gamethe game innovative approach progression wont keep everybody entertained forever game well worth price negativity flowing around stopped getting game made feel game horrible time game went sale decided pick actually alot fun feeling exploring finding new ares lore different quests combat isnt bad seeing xp system got removed still great game feeling getting good loot random structures rewarding worst part game starting get past segment game gets alot better would recommend game people want nice relaxing time mods pretty good game mods game fun mainly removing region lock bs super difficult start get decent item becomes touch doable game world lot fun always feels like new places explore mods game decent put lots effort hype game wont let like go without fight alpha received free felt unplayable originally without mods first world hoping mods save update year gap couldnt speak player base see would enjoyed changes game put simply gameplay super unfun repetitive playstyle reward reason many sales relied massive amount hype get day one sales many people didnt refund hours play time get thought would get better region locking badwithout region locking absolutely god like wanna game amount gameplay played wanna say enjoyable learned new system works obvious flawsi like idea challenging new area arent steamrolling backtracking worry friends levels gear compared areas however gear system works could improved adding degrading system instead outright making gear useless upon leaving gears intended area would make system far tolerablei also like idea end goal area get artifacts give character permanent stat increase long term progression however also another flaw fact increases stats glider speed mount speed light radius etc make tempting go long term progression actual stats combat would also much better execution ideathe gameplay pretty much feels alright though enemies could use scaling tweaks balances make fair player combat learned enjoyable others may like itthe visuals really nice look nice colorful voxel styled game makes exploring around appealing experience compared open world gameslastly something felt add playing solo experience get repetitive sooner rather later played least one friend made game feel lot fun less grindy could say lot games get legit felt like much enjoyable buddy playing alongso overall decent big flaws could improved wanted continue system neat looking game lot better playing others games current system location locked gear makes impossible feel like anything matters youll spend hours zone unlock full set legendary get two artifacts maybe head new zone effectively make new character classes play exact min played hours slight variation coming weapon choice game opportunity something good progression system gets reworked isnt worth money even gets reworked youre still looking game arguably worse alpha mod removes region lock feel confident toil wont erased nice time waster good exploration game recent news future update addressing concerns im hopeful game sort like mans sky recommend sale since still get decent fun current version current long gameoldwith complete stop communication dont see potential fixes updates future game feels incomplete still fun really want wait big enough saleold reviewa game needs time get use toit certainly different alpha still lot funeven though lack overall progression besides artefacts bit sadbut yes still lot bugs balance things need fixedits rough still lot potential opinion get eventually years rewrites wasnt enough guesssolo multiplayer matterrip horizontal progression without purchasing

final product upgrade wow disappointmentimagine spineless make people pay alpha barely update years lie twitter didcome saying youre officially releasing b somehow still less features alpha years ago bwhy region locking remove skill tree remove exp level system know whybecause couldnt assd worry carefully balancing difficulty throughout game didnt want players reaching point powerful instead removed features matter good player much time spent getting loot completing whole area started back afterwards way wouldnt deal difficulty curve rightyoud better another forgotten developer greedy werent kids grew watching youtubers play cube world hit adulthood probably bank account nowid say youre like yandere dev least yandere devs alpha free loose stuffs need stuffs play games become god story game game doesnt either yes know unsure buying enjoy game cannot recommend masses hear outi really wanted recommend game really theres much missing balance horrible imho said still enjoyable play gamethis game alot fun look past gear turning useless upon entering new losing items help exploring upon entering new xp bar sort character customization affects dying enemy higher current gear tier unless know ways games permanent progression exploration stats eg consume less stamina look guide figuring everything cause game doesnt explain basically everything without big changes gameplaythat said good things game opinion alot bad onesthe game adorable artstyle amazing music running around things feels somewhat good see landscapes combat mechanics feel pretty smooth balance read negativestheres alot alot mention variety negativesyou always find challenge seek oneyou pet animals cute tame almost animal see also cute pogmultiplayer playing friends always alot fun loot based per region progression system youll find better gear chance mobs defeating bosses completing quests said gear gets locked certain region kingdom gear locked kingdoms makes usable adjacent regions information available gathered npcs towns adventurers around map game still bugs devs working theseeverything except artifacts find region belongs region usable region exception gear includes

stuff fun worth hours entertainment sqeeze iti bought alpha came dont think fair comparison didnt like get refund still enjoyed yeah abandonware move along find better game yeah pretty good takes get rollinga tutorial world system would go long long wayi hated first picked chill game jump small burstwould reccommend reading steam guides yeah playtime low theres number reasons including dropping windows support requiring jiggering play simply interested game becomei purchased game based product yearss ago roadmap supplied continued action rpg road really liked look really enjoyed alpha shelved since expected updates come didnt want burn nothing happened years cut january year developer put another little bit information come every months game still moving towards roadmap outlinedagain cut ahead months land announcement game actually released excited looked deeper found game nearly every feature stripped barebones quasirpg true progression procedural worlds skill trees unimpressed community surrounding itim going make politics happened say game liked cannot recommend find plenty information happened changed elsewhere doubt seen already youre read far check back future see game returned roots currently looking like threw money away yeah nothis game brutal difficulty isnt necessarily bad thing cube world makes bad think favorite hard games whether something like dark souls roguelite like binding isaac time fight enemy die learn mistakes whether dodging playing defensive finding openings attackscube world teaches fight enemies would expect giant rock monster annihilate soon start game everything said rock monsters tiny snails kill hits doesnt matter much try dodge focus attacks die respawnnaturally playing game almost hour decided search internet believed playing game wrong found interesting things make never want touch game cant reasonably attack monsters get better weapon find randomly world rare item drops means isnt tactics use get upper hand combat rather need good game isnt based procedural generation promised years ago instead everyone starts world spawns different world split zones leave zone another one items turned starter gear game wants complete tasks inside zone get feeling completion moving onto next zone starting completely ruins idea exploration limits confined area ready start scratchi know play game another hour still get refund cant bare hard know someones passion project really isnt honestly dont think lot people year old excited eventually play game year old cannot find fun inside yeah played back day super excited see worked im gonna wait years see gets unscrewed yeah games kind garbage release wouldnt recommend buying dev decides stop radio silent makes empty game less empty game lacking

needed add longevity game without would still use old overpowered gear itd almost alpha another thing believe could worked artifact system get artifact gives tiny bonus movement abilities diminishing returns like desperately needs improved upon doesnt seem impactful future id like see affect stats well allowing actual permanent character progression aside movement abilities love game need look right mindset action rpg rogue like elements resetting new areas keeping couple things yes know people desagree im sure devs update game bad ways mods btw fun time playing little repetitive yes

cube world caught eye weapon customisation massive world deep combat time looked unique isnt nowsince alpha barely changed ways changed worse b firstly get rest hastily written review list main points levelling system stupidly obtuse never tells level way level makes combat weapon customisation cool idea get weapons frequently worthless way difficult ways telling straying area youre prepared look samethe game massive disappointment find exhausting try explain every detail reality feel best way review game reviewing point feature list currently store pageb choose four different classes warrior ranger mage rogue byes choose different classes common lot games change subclasses apart couple combat ability changes doesnt tell else changed actually find details class subclass need google since information cannot found ingameif players must consult wiki understand basics game something seriously wrong isnt grand strategy simple voxelbased fighting game cant teach player play game intuitive

simplistic crafting ie find x make z standard crafting games nowadaysregarding weapons weapons gain bonuses area collected cool idea map big regions plentiful needlessly complicates inventory

else even eagles useless grand scheme things time ive used fly players multiplayer game problem shouldnt exist please explain multiplayer game players get spawned excess away cube worlds unique perland progression system makes finding loot solving quests clearing dungeons rewarding exciting bthis fun thing find equipment reason decided region lock items go one area another equipment disappears must find boat every region requires every region game go find glider find climbing boots find boat etc etc repeat youre sick game stupid must collect equipment benefit serve apart elongating game rewarding pointless use hang glider take skies explore oceans boat bsee point need find every zone move one zone another boat hang glider disappear overall worth finding find magic

bestyour region b hardcore gamers b sadly end game artifact grinding pet collecting andor braking game way ppl wants clear world mapgod speed great game amazing soundtrack voxel graphics think look detailed outstanding concern game im sure may heard whether like style progression compared alpha progress style completely scrapped progression vertical horizontal words climb top fall back bottom continue game map huge completing region two youll mostly find playing game anymore however beating regions takes long time satisfying say least design changes wouldnt made still recommend game regardless lot fun verdict game lot fun worth spending money design changes could made better reward player terms progression see wollay continues supporting game adding content got steam key felt amazing knowing play beautiful game againafter playing h feel empty even alpha much options worldin current state cant recommend title spoiler download alpha spoiler cube world game played back alpha fun game opinion criticisms others ignored theyre valid games progression system fun good slightest leave region start cannot use items youve picked like glider climbing spikes gears power reduced point useless regionlocking terrible idea havent played starting region enough say like start new region gear removal exp skill trees sad see trees actually pretty interesting level collecting artifacts sounds weird ill touch later lack tutorial bad idea seems like lack outside play testing entire game feels like played tested one person probably considering wollay developer prefers keep work finished says played game alpha even clue progress looked steam guide useful guide recommend using even think know whole lore artifact system really isnt fun im still first region keep finding lore regions region really damn annoying deal getting feels like grind artifact havent gotten yet feels like chore get well need staryellow gear even think approaching area artifact kept ive played almost hours writing review still havent gotten gear except chestplate star level one observation correct im wrong feels like wasnt much new content added game systems entirely reworked six years wollay went mia cant seem pick anything really new added minus lore artifacts thats pretty troubling think might seem like doom gloom modern cube world theres quite things found enjoyableloved new cube world even theyre mostly also games alpha game feels polished ive encountered bugs ive noticed game saving windowed resolution upon startup game combat simple yet personally enjoy doesnt feel like need super skilled fight overly complex bit simple love music much game whimsical fills feeling wanting see games pretty world graphics simple dont need amazing art direction game nice love colors used designs playable playable really odd races creatures voxelbased design might make seem like nothing minecraft clone nothing really even similar minecraft game also never drops frames thats surprising since mid highrange pc mileage may varylike said beginning lot fun playing game far even wasnt game expecting play typically play openworld games beating area moving onto next anyway regionlocking items awful idea hope wollay changes future feel like game shouldve worked bit fresh content added well game lot potential would shame see abandoned since game hit finally even though really doesnt feel like im going give game positive review hopes game becoming better hopefully removal regionlocking reintroduction skill trees old leveling system disappointing outcome game great world open world rpg explore region find craft equipment power fight stronger enemies ultimate treasure artifacts discover voxel game art style seems unique charm runs well aging pc despite voxel aesthetics building game customise look weapons editing modelsat start game choose classes warrior mage rogue ranger class two variants switch later game give different abilities skillset class fairly limited rather distinctivethe world procedurally generated theres fairly decent selection biomes within one makes region theres also villages find npcs workbenches craft items equipment also find friendly npcs roaming around time time talking npc give hints certain items another mechanic pets tame fight ridea premise sets fantastic foundation build solid game upon sadly foundation get cube world ill get thing note enemies equipment colour coded tier kill hostile mob usually get little bit gold occasionally piece equipment tier mob killed gold spent shops buy items equipmentwhen first start enemies kill quickly even cows give hard time however cheesed bringing friendly npcs fight really one strategies use early rely rng get stronger getting better equipment way thats going happen dont get experience points game problem stats dramatic effect cube world want kill stronger enemy find strong npc let get lucky get powerful piece equipment hopefully matches class equipped massive effect combat ability go damage steamrolling multiple enemies like nothing go two shot becoming virtually invincible enemies one item change things quickly next granularity progression feels unfair reliant luck npcs work rather skill doesnt feel satisfying become powerfulthe fights quite simple still good thing fight tactically however enemy attacks difficult impossible dodge usually end trading blows unless cheese enemy ai snipe range moving aggro doesnt feel like theres skill involved however fight even toppling powerful enemies feels unsatisfying way around region usually going various points interest take time get one place another obtaining boat hang glider speed things travelling still takes majority game time fine theres lot things way world feels empty lifeless occasionally might find ore deposits hidden loot vast majority time running across fields nothing get b fast travel thing game everything spread still takes get somewhere nearest spawn pointthe points interests usually contain small dungeon boss need kill bosses act like slightly stronger versions regular enemies quests rewarding though get guaranteed drop tier location also hard reach places contain either gold special items boat hang glider help traverse region faster get previously inaccessible locationsfinally also large dungeons tend difficult places region also house artifact give permanent increase certain noncombat stats elephant room poor balance makes really janky experience comes powering region youve completed region go well obvious answer would move next region keep going world basically endless procedurally generated could go wrongas soon enter different region gear region becomes grey tier lowest tier boat instantly disappears hang glider vanishes thin air reins go poof get picture revisit region found items get back regain tier well however means complete new region need start scratchnow isnt necessarily bad system roguelikes tend use example really successful whats wrong cube world answer lies variety start scratch expect play different game every time perhaps enemies different environment different items get different gameplay dramatically changed new combination keeps replayability factor interest game cube world none youve explored one region youve explored item drops dont change way play game occasionally may tanky glass cannon thats differentiating factor every dungeon basically last one looking cosmetically different enemies fight exactly way basically playing exact game new region explore trying find decent equipment region awkward way longevity cube world far biggest flawthose artifacts yeah marginally increase stats generally unimportant increase swimming speed go find boat slightly faster basically dont matter next impact repetitive nature game world felt decent enough first region despite balance issues long travel time highlights id say talking npcs give quests locations items find made first couple hours fun became apparent game first region learning every region afterwards would play exactly way incentive continue playingits shame cube world potential much desperately needs content game basically everything randomly generated absolutely needs much variety keep things interesting however right depth puddle given track record developers highly doubt ever changewhich leads final question cube world worth money quarter price id give slack least enjoyment game however currently stands answer resounding disappointed cube world back picromas site years back time game typical levelingskill progression elements ton outside leveling showed massive potential sadly updates stopped rolling alpha build developer didnt update game little half decadeso presented official release cube world longer alpha buildcube world better areas regarding locations quests worse progression arguably hours total due regions pregenerated map locking gear region three gear made work multiple regions youre always encouraged regear keep ability keep exploring without reverted square one beyond repetitive gameplay loop youre rewarded slight permanent noncombat buffs character within region would think would aid clearing zones even faster truth youll need clear numerous zones seeing speed benefits youre looking gain less per boost get youll still need keep obtaining certain mobility tools theyre something truly keep goodthe release build feels like side grade alpha implies endless potential replayability traditional leveling systems games elsewhere really see small amount content offer without massive grind found alpha build bcube world may always game limitless potential b world full complete start things easy simple answers im gonna judging crap game merits certain things ive privy towards alpha player understanding used changed added taken away ive even returned alpha help review wont predominately negative review end day im still judging represented displayed us good first thing note try give sense big expansive world full things giving us semidestructive environment foliage destroyed attacks weapon enemies certain areas like snow thick covered areas cleared attacks thats always something see animals enemies even giving pets choose taming although still big number think still somethingtheyve upgraded mages wand laser attack amazing feature love something ive grown heavily rely fire mage provided much entertainment slaughtered many foes minimal effort compared alpha fireballwaterball attack fling much hate got rid skill progression tree help fire mages giving us better alternative attack flame salvo attack instead close range explosion three meteors caster flings air still good aoe remarkable damage hitwater effects much better release certain noises much better ill even give dungeons better release traps alpha felt rather useless existing without purpose release theres pitfalls lava pits little platforms need navigate jumping fighting better regards ive played mage really reference stand bynow way something shared alpha cube world general whole extremely unfriendly new players arent used controls game never knew dodge much less teleporting option betarelease help feature came even things like quests certain areas game locked certain items unlock needs friendlier method inform players go next thats questing journals tend thing either make people naturally gravitate towards itemsmind becomes less problem learn things harsh lesson give new players good way drive away potential ones staying good frustration motivates someone keep going theres bad frustration shuts desire keep goinganother problem lack resources cant get stronger leveling need rely gear weaponry main method better yet three methods acquisition list weaponarmor shops improved gnome rescue missions crafting improved defeating special bosses crafting books random drops gear similar color tends fall enemies like colors exception miniboss enemies scale one higher listand shops arent guaranteed every item random assortments items usually two color maybe youre lucky less though crafting reliable method rare circumstances actually chance craft gear work region youre along neighboring lands adjacent land made thats still extremely rare usually youre grinding constantly get right pieces able clear areas leave region run region locking main issue lot people game another problem course fact unlocks specific region well list upgrades crafting recipe books upgrades shops gnomes hang glider boats climbing boots reinslistthe methods unlocked tends matter go saving one gnome pretty much understand going play go every single time difficulty youre fighting different thing really carries artifacts boosts effects climbing swimming similar things theyre way level doesnt really give much benefit long run one thing tried multiplayer horrible lag nightmarish wasnt playable didnt want go watching monsters running like trying reenact something benny hill show liked alpha version much problems release things like flaws understand game released flaws still active full display world see feels incomplete everything pulled alpha halfbaked could much want see much better anyone asks worth buying isnt dont buy unless want halffinished product still problems developers gone quiet community basically fending thats painful thing

get game comments listed good reasons garbage region locking butchered gameplay loop general lack content valid thats worst theres even guarantee youll able play game purchased bought full price launched ive waiting since alpha cant run game got play hours interesting game takes long get going people go hour limit refund realize garbage crashed wouldnt open ever day cant run garbage heap computer isnt beastly gaming machine definitely capable running games like even better ones crashes black immediately every launch game dev ran money like weasel updates fixing almost guarantee hasnt touched since launch even think ignore region lock garbage general watering get game theres decent chance wont even let run randomly one day restarted computer uninstalled cleaned folder reinstalled anyone wonders even fresh install tried vain attempt cant launch maybe money blow game cant even run someone whos broke shit disappointing waste money youre gonna sell trash game least let run said trash game complete let wish steam would remove farce game recommend casual gamers want bit quick easy looked forward finally try cube word hopes high loved pictures small videos ive seen years never tried alpha idea used state right recommend casual gamers want bit quick easy fun went died second never figured maybe im adventures enough ive say person working professional uxui everyday game illustrates lot things really want say something good short experience game thing guess reason ive looking forward try graphics really pretty eye game future game changes road better update reviewi see wollay coming region locking gear removal xp seems decent concept right poorly implemented kinda discourages exploring different regions going different region almost different creating new character doesnt feel like im progressing character besides major issue game decently fun see getting bit dry maybe hours play keep eye game interested right cannot recommend charm years ago honestly really saddens mealso ton cool teased features like castles big cities quest lines playable races etc seem removed game loopbuonly played hours havent gotten everything first region yet cant speak much crafting doesnt seem worthwhile outright find better gear laying around craft saving long timei love gear skill rather artificially inflated numbers friends farm bunch exp play gear gets better different abilities still ubcharacter designbupositivei love gear skill rather artificially inflated numbers friends farm bunch exp play gear gets better different abilities still youvisually

really enjoyed sounds music game far understand whats happening things supposed sounds music masterpiece noticable enough remember enjoy themonly sound issue ive game starting sound music volume extremely loud ended taking able regain hearing like game fun bought alpha way back first released picroma site played alpha time betas release sometimes alone solo times group friends manually shared copy fun week dropped next several months new fresh run started morehonestly would probably version loads fun september first hit made solo character frog ranger named flipper basically played game game next days like last several runs alpha prior dropped game felt fun play started something else agree game flaws systems dont think way bad guess go opinion im nothing person interested game design yet dont think ill ever see making anything note worthy list gear progression system actually liked xp counterpart grinding xp next skill points fun yes alpha character skills mobility skills level dont see grinding mindlessly next skill point start almost hell levels difficult basically naked white gear found green weapon game instantly became much enjoyable complaint crafting green weapon fine anything blue rarity gear crazy expensive time consuming obtain making crafting essentially worse option maybe missed crazy amount resources adventure region locking interesting effectively plays difficulty scaling game dont hit power cap first hours game served purpose well felt kind rouge like without dying part liked course think removing different mechanic would better option reworking one idea wish could play around zelda botw style durability weapons maybe change drop rates lower tier common high yellow tier elusively rare maybe hard quest rewards would make play multiple weapons keep hand full different situations honestly like idea much also remove mobility items like boat reins hang glider honestly idea fix besides one done seems easy reducing energy cost boring bandaid fix imo artifacts replacing xp leveling system something like although dislike lack way tell character actually skills bringing back class buildings would probably warrant world wipe make due new town generating true world predetermined npc act teacher guide tells class would extremely helpful back artifacts like fun collecting dont like current given stats seem unnecessary maybe letting player choose stat would better non combat ones though honestly thats really got listtheirs would like talk feel rest qol stuff would like things work currently though really enjoy game regret buying alpha years back im glad wollay put another version pleased wollay continues working game cool think id still find fun ever version releases fun game eyes plan playing itedit trying format make look nicer im used writing reviews new biomes structures compared alphanew enemies bosses tamable animals compared alphathe steam multiplayer integration smooth overall functioning combat fun sometimes especially boss tutorial exploration based gameplay loop removes everything need explore change biomesarea boats hang gliders riding pets bound zonebiome found cant buy either enter new area early game starts youre essentially back start super rare loot override border resets still greatly diminish quality venture initial biome found inremoval game feedback show youre actually progressingremoval basic fundamentals game people enjoyed alpha way back skillsskill tree skill slotsthe alpha back better gameplay loop skill tree xp system gave players direction focusthe difficulty curve far high early game cant level need get artefacts order level andthe benefits leveling skills attached artefacts plainly worth even cares swim speedclimbing speedlantern radius passives make skills climbing boat speed swim speed etc increase level use like wollay shown build previews give artefacts purposeful stat upgrades values ratio artefactstoskill points ramp slow literally need find hundreds get highest skill levelsvery little insentive take enemies outside quest bosses case early game everything slap goofy one hit well end game loot drops worth servers forced use friends steam order play players key binds questionable confusing example hold ctrlmousewheel updown camera zoom ctrl key also makes character walk held puts risk battlesclass skill abilities moved traditional mmorpg skill key binds keys keyboard strange combinations shiftmouse commands sure changed alpha keys new purpose bound nothing right nowin alpha world map hidden adding sense mystery world greater insentive explore world map completely uncovered see everything start might bad thing everyone felt quite diminishing compared alphain alpha towns clearly highlighted map current biome even hadnt discovered yet gave player general direction first load world remove content find quests talking random npcs towns everyone quest lot npcs towns results talk every single npc town order find quests alpha npcs quest would marked exclamation mark heads remove content already multiplayer party status hud removed even though alpha given quest sometimes quest marker location highlighted map sometimes wont worldgen completely changed longer use seeds like alpha build many content snapshots shown wollays lead developer twitter completely missing stripped lot function see today listthe gameloop focused around exploring collecting artefacts level game contradicts essentially forcing players back stage want explore taking away players equipment giving enough incentive player actually pursue artefacts regions due lackluster rewards fundamentally hurts game creating boring core game experience ultimately leaves player feeling aimless personally led stop playing zero reason play current formits important note game seems content mechanics found alpha stripped away well content saw wollay reveal throughout years development found twitter feed dont understand allthis game currently fun play personally expected years development kinda zone takes hours beat move next zone start lose boat glider armorweapons enough verity justify resetting progresslisti would consider ok kept items much larger area play beat single zone reason keep playing outside seeing new zones completing entire zone give player one piece gear good zones scratch system generated lore put something worth trying read would give reason find lore keep adding new bioms lore keep coming back listjust cents years recommend cube world unique rpg isnt one anymore unique exploration game fun rewards leaving single stone unturnedblots backlash alpha rpg styled one exploration focused really downgrade different take worth enjoy lot exploration focused games cube world remains great timeironically people complain still access alpha fine theyd rather even clearly prefer muchquotethanosas long remember always unable accept quote madman carry apples want carry moreyou foolyou dumbothe game different back apples liked itthis game dissapointmentthis game masterpiece bye bye world world cubes problem cube matter side look falls write longer detailed review later short game isnt worth time money doesnt matter bought game years ago back alpha released list promises weirdly enough looking game full release today game worth buying opinionthe game open procedurally generated supposedly endless world yet gates world regions soft barriers gear weapons armour degrades essentially starting gear cross region border unless farm good gear complete quests zone unlock ability farm good gear symbol travel region without stuff degrading againthere xp leveling system stats determined gear level eventually find legendary gear persists across regions kingdom without degrading itll degrade soon enter another kingdom game doesnt vary things combat simplistic theres xp reason fight mobs littered throughout world unless want tiny bit gold odd crafting itemcrafting gear mostly pointless obtaining new gear isnt rewarding stumble quests really map markers unlocked spamming use key every npc encounter find unmarked npcs give quest markers maptheres nothing interesting keep playing skill trees new abilities mix things theres strategy combat simplistic need better gear take mobs game actually game dump new character middle area completely surrounded hostile mobs take hits theres tutorials little explained game reward understanding everything boring gameif enjoy spamming e bunch random friendly npcs spending ages walking map markers putting new gear repeat process forever maybe youll great time could also pull weeds garden bare hands though id much rather quotearcane raise long development final result huge disappointment would expect finished product polished gameplay many features keep dreaming quote bit rough around edges still crazy fun challenging experience flawed game doubt personally find good time game different alpha still combat old cube world little different fun game play wait years development game improved somewhat game still bland lacks content developer comes back second mia adds content would recommend game current unfinished content less state cant years game barely got better years disappointment really fun hard hours game playing first build awesome best played friends games could use features still fun playing hours longer launch game fun worth problems waiting years update one best childhood game im really sad see turned basically going back level one time cross border still cube world game fun play coop gets boring really quickly compared

difficulty scaling solid multiplayer well comes overhauled version already great alpha filled everything loved new combos enemies dungeons everything game got massive boost turned great game quite different rpgs great cube world one problem alpha skill tree exp system levels completely gone abilities readily available makes game different games also kind ruins whole point game feel useless leveling xp grind makes alot game pointless painful leveling region get artifact increases riding speed bring back xp level skill tree game could even better good without yes bad without could much

hype release even tho played since beta still good game didnt play alpha far enjoying game lot world looks cool lot stuff explore interesting stuff lot people seem complaining regions honestly region big enough easily stay around hours still finding things gear didnt reset regions dont see could kind challenge hours gameplay would recommend playing friend found different classes really go well together ranger warrior work amazinglyi really complaints boat hang glider controls really hard use anything going forward especially apparent hang glider one wrong button press sent spiral towards ground impossible escape times count half special items seem one use regions usually uses good meanwhile special items seem required reigns boat required want travel long distances quicklyoverall think theres issues rest game really funi one request small change though make clouds solid found way get one fazed dont even care theres anything would cool walk around high different form alpha many ways several good yes essentialy restart area unless aquire specific type gear neighboring area game gives something strive alpha hit lvl pieces legendary gear almost invincible nice able continue character still able challenge instead total domination hours play time wish would bump green gear instead worthless legendthe new hang glider system stinks though different alpha still fun imo different bad fee quirks need fixing fun disappointing current state many things promised either removed never added potential improve updates stands worth price tag buy alpha far better waste time money lol dont buy game used awesome everyone super excited release really shit dont recommend dont buy game rn nonlinear progression makes want give adventurer stay town dont buy complete waste moneythe alpha much better dont go expecting play exact game years agoyes game unfinished surestill hella funi hoping updates dude old beta version fun like bruh eh good even better ever great job

im hating history issue fact gradual leveling area instead must search one star area find treasure much area fun friends fun mod fun mods fun mods fun yet takes time progress funny game fun game fun game gets first major update years update wasnt received well game hasnt touched developer tweeted anything game since release really loved game alpha however cant recommend game good game good wow game fun idk else say game good lol game poorly optimized im spending solid minute waiting terrain generate fog surrounds time dissipate ive played alpha bit im sad runs better supposedtobepolished versionmaybe better people proper gaming setups proper release better possibly earliest available versionnot mention multitude complaints youve already probably seen negative reviews fog war makes exploration pointless items regionlocked forces effectively start anew every biome yadda yaddai recommend pirating alpha though pretty fun game solid base work build become amazing rpg game disappointing original game like years ago better game ruined better back game sucks removed everything alpha made fun game good game good steam pepelaugh game really good broken website alpha steam version vastly change mechanics overall gameplay better alot worse like alpha went dead years steam version seems following suit little contact patches since launch client coop ok plagued issues game zone gear limited quests overall gameplay give enough revived long term simply much messperhaps another stint years get another update cw overall right either buy game mess around friends coop alpha really worth buying form right much feeling like placeholder unfinished game much better multiplayer whole world didnt restart every region games pretty fun walk minuts direction progress gets reset generally direction game went well item based progression nice artifactleveling system kind good made levels seem insignificant extremely slow caught gear region lock everything would fine werent region locking opinion thats likely others think well lots fun first hours played friends got new region became extremely shitty due region locking gear system making everything wearing tools got previous region useless old cube world extremely fun despite repetitive new region lock gear extremely bad id recommend friends system punishes exploration game explore get mods makes everything whole lot better glad finally getting attention worth bucks love little gem bought years ago cheap worth right go pirate alpha better shit go alpha better experience good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good nostalgic game good combat gear gets downgraded massively good fun peps never played alpha good game good game good game good game good game good game good game like new progression system little bit raw around edges lots fun like hard games loads people crying lack lvls crab able kill like play easy games play metin grinding easy mobs hours gametldrgame cookie clicker fans good game although perfect would recommend good game needs little updates good game dont listen hater good game play mods good game nuff said good game needs work good game play friends real grind area area use mods good game play friends alone good game say good game playing areas get mod remove area locked items good game bit far feel everyone wanted good gamebit grindy becomes repetitive game still good game play friends good game mods turn region lock good imo wait sale good need work though good stuf good thing paid worth turkish dollars good basically restart game good mod yees good hope keep getting updated got like thousands hours alpha come alpha better actuall full release game tragic garbage got game year came early alpha clear devs completely abandoned pretty fun theres much content thing cause pretty much still alpha gamei wouldnt pay great example game didnt live hype worse could still pretty fun time waster great sorta thoughts head empty adventure gamelots people bash gear doesnt carry regions thats really problem opinion fact loot doesnt carry means theres real end goal game doesnt work linear story based game isnt one keep coming back every days bit fun great game great game great game great game great game great game great game played years ago first came still enjoy playing great game mod great game lots fun frustrating great game great game tons fun great game really enjoyed eve slow computer great graphics amazing immersion owl hoots dark great mate would rate greatest come back history better karate kid lot fun playing multiplayer going blindly never played alpha beta haha free reward haha free reward haha know would crazy added xp skill tree system jk jk unless alot potential like change loot region locked well removal level progression mostly sure done update review either things change alpha tested ive blast purely better version game hi used watch cube world youtube finnally got chance play although game dosent quite stand upto likes origanal gameplay saw youtube stand true see tbh still good inspires finnish area instead rushing functionality like awesome rpg expeirence id definatly still recomend game must hold hold recommend theres couple really controversial systems might alienate firstthe game locks gear specific region drops gear region surrounding regions honestly first heard thought stupid played stopped feeling like dont get wrong problems around notably around crafting materials actually enjoy meant serve gameplay loop replacing subtle oh youre high level use cool glowing sword anymore better use higher level shitty blue sword instead well quicker mountains harsher valleyssadly imo region locking also applies special items stuff like reins letting ride pet glider self explanatory sky flute summons birds specific locations lift floating islands etcgrindy af good kind grindyfeatures missingartifacts one driving forces incentivise move regions lacklustre affect movement abilities taken away region suffer diminishing returns even first one pick doesnt feel massively impactfuldevs person team active beta fixing bugs im quietly optimistic future relevant game went alpha six years ago well community overwhelmed two alpha got like two bug fixes honestly enjoy playing game wish stuff alpha wish gear wasnt regionlocked youre interested wait sale honestly fun like hours yeah thats iti feel like system could work actual progression honestly rn worth buying theres many flaws grind experience feel rewarding especially considering amount time takes u spend first hour every new zone becoming competant enough survive basic mobs running around avoiding combat say redeeming quality game everything one hit u mention classes specifically warrior flawed bugged honestly alpha much potential way exp system completely removed completely removes sense progression one wish would built game alpha kept good thingsexp system class tree randomly generated terrain seems got rid games good qualities attempted improve bad things honestly disappointing used play alpha back forth till loot rewarding back stats equipment stayed throughout game didnt spend hours get good enough equipment one region find artifact insignificantly increases climbing time get reset go next regionquests left completely unsatisfying painstakingly realise every good item youve toiled get utterly useless next region making progress fruitless endeavour ponder reason still playing game bullying thinking made sort advancement honestly game way better alpha even region lock thing equipement since longer probleme understand game work relics fun spirit bell song favorite part certainly add gameplay killing bosses manageable alpha killing large group weaker enemies fantastic downside think multiplayer system probleme like want start game friend spawn another region hell find equipements region play youll give yourselfmy conclusion game greatly improved nearly domain good adventure exploration game hope upgrade game uwu love cube world disappointed new update cant get xp multiplayer via steam sucks friend spawn miles away cant reach friend world singleplayer love game fixed multiplayer spawn friend absolutely love game dont understand people give much hate acualy loved alpha leveling system everything else awsome relics leveling bad idea keep relics add leveling system well think game might explode love good time playing game may hard u play u enjoy game see love put worldbut also missing thingsya know wolly made artfact give game changing powers maybe like boots make walk water claws let ya dig find tresure go layer maybe kind spring boost ya around would pretty neat things start honestly

would trow money anyway cant escape pit fall one help cant recommend game current state cant see thing bought play cant would like refund cant get one dont recommend cube world opinion proggresion system game way better im hating game anything love grinding combat new regions added game still think could done better job dont understand managed make alpha better beta please get redo bring back levels regionlock excuse go play alpha enjoyed game bit earlier versions around better final result kinda stopped playing realized much got removed feel removing region locked progression would mend game good deal got beta fun cool rpg game game progression swimming speed good time werid bug think anyway load game computer frezzes hear music title music see black screen lighter black screen get kikced game every time like minutes thats e trying load know way fix help always wanted play game got nothing objective every thing starter region hard talk someone tell something important cant get

interesting enchanting played hours ok best wont even start without crashingwhat went wrong october deleted blog disappeared weve bamboozled boys wanted like game whas looking forward however disappointed everything good cube world first hours linked back alpha thought development years least half problems alpha version would fixed arenttrying explore world punish gear spent time getting used region try go new region like starting new character avoided though exploring world staying region spawn thats fun way mention skill treeprogression system main way progressing region gearim sure good things game later however would much better buy game spend money something else good experience top bottom doesnt need hours playing minimum get anywhere considering right think take alot longer two hours get decent gear part alpha testing high hopes upon hearing cube world finally coming years amazing thought dead done projectlittle know store would make wish stayed dead happy memoryupon first creating new character quickly discovered mob touch capability kill hits instantly ok change weapons thing find slimes theyre always easy end dying hits upon respawn still aggroed followed straight back respawn killed toofinally giving made new character new world different yet slightestok lets go discussions maybe theres issue strong mobs literally right next spawn point every single direction explanation theres plenty people complaining whats changed gear progression catalyst combat game guess start straight zero go beyond regions borders start instances dungeons cross regions screw region completion boss beyond line youll flying sailing whoops crossed threshold use glider boat anymore many glaring issues anyone point wait release maybe issue impossible mobs right next spawn stop issue nope make brand new character literally every single direction rank higher shot dare come close hightail run past looking town tip youtube run run run cleared innital mobs ran good minutes straight without seeing single soul town occassional gnome trader whos expensive anywaysfinally find set mobs still star higher cannot defeated starting gearand im ive abandoned wishing

next please add progression system game beautiful extremely fun play gliding around finding new pets breath fresh air nonsense little reward artifacts feels disrespectful cant recommend game updated progression system real progression leveling unrewarding alpha ok potential none itas yet still trash mods may help game bit game fundamentaly flawed nope cant recommend currently game everybody also unfair project expectations somebody elses vision great game respect fun fun fun fun fun gonna lie game kinda sucks foundation movement solid fighting pretty enjoyable loops youll encounter theres much skill terms getting gear matter killing everything sight even means take advantage games mechanics respawn shrines example theres story weight progression unbelivably slow time especially beginning havent played alpha cant join train hating game bc changed much however negatives aside said solid foundation could great game recommend least going one biome disagree lot ideas exicuted game hold lot interesting game design ideas id like see updates improve game could good good good good good enough good gem like alpha cube worldnot worth recommend recommended fun enjoy rp games nothing interesting really reason anything seems except look new drop stay good play better hard fun good unless like running around empty landscapes nothing really worth moment needs lot work worth tho got free played alpha good worth money buy please update forever anything buy game please please worth money still feel empty worth money would good free play oh god cube world become game worse ever everything loved alpha gone wait theres get new zone game inventory gets reset skill trees gone fun aswellsorry cube world thought gonna big game years came horrendous one oh game good alpha ok im loving game goespositivesthe game solid state play tons things encounters everywhereloot actually drops enemies hard actually kill things anymore depending skill level time game releasemassive biomes areas clear get loot dungeons end everything areanegatives xp removed cant drop armor items weapons friends cant drop hp potions anything really inventory becomes mess really quicklyarea lock items utilties climbing spikes ability ride pet wistles ect love god remove lock items one wants client mod easily already made even put lock items first place bring back xpother moment really solid game fun play friends step new biome lose hours whatever hours things world cube long live grind guess ok wollay reading think game great issue without xp system less incentive kill anything also fix possessed shop owners possessed screwing store functions also would like variety travel merchants gem trader abundant also maybe even adding class jobs play styles per class limiting also please add things stores instead item day final note add map generation independent characters times areas dont like meaning delete character keep positive review hope pressure doesnt hope consider changing game back former glory one childhood game still love owned game alpha stage loved drastically changed since better peaceful cute designs fun spend time friends people complain lose equipment go different area see always new land beat hate get overpowered game enemies scale feel like never get powerful always chance run area return later stronger beat great game exploring always area beat performance issues options refuse save theres direction besides talking npcs getting fetch quest across map hang glidergood game needs time get patched im sure wollay make something great personally start game wasnt really enjoying picked rogue struggled fight kill monsters flew friends region downgrades gear restarted game started enjoy ive put almost ten hours game recommend overall think pretty decent game could make better introducing new feature removing like region downgrade could add new mechanics like building rebirth would take stuff away would powerfull think game lot potential would love see grow play mods please save suffering play mods played beta got excited disappointed played game since alpha wayy back around game getting update saw updates wollays twitter came come september beta releases hyped couldnt wait promised features alpha become reality genuinely excited game played back late middle school coming back graveunfortunately lot aforementioned promised features lead purchasing arent even game fact feels like removed things may done quality qol changes ability teleport shrines overall feels like one step forward two steps backi really tried enjoy beta really really tried feels frustrating start grinding hours region equipments stats go stars op stats way feels like beginning ironic explorative rpg punishes exploring outside region gear sure carry artifacts items name artifacts stats given artifact barely even affect anything things usually worthless ie swim speed lantern light size im sure items considering feels like rng getting ill try play see theres guaranteed way get themall think game could really use quite bit change specifically regarding way progression made theyre choosing keep artifacts artifacts actually boost players base stats instead something miniscule maybe change region locking works instead instantly reducing stats nearly nothing go away base region weaker stats become ie region weakens like half something regions make completely region locked something similar encourages people get better armor without completely screwing played game since came website sure alot changed still love core n honest prefer new system implemented everything gets wiped get new area please add back progressionleveling system pleasethere massive insatisfaction time change region loved gaining ton levels friends whenever killed bosses tough enemies point please add skill trees levels please clean things locations new characters please dont buy please fix game wollay want goodi like fun mods would recommend anyone current state please make real content gameplease pls go back old cube world dont like way game less fun way grindy less fun ive played hours finished whole area map went new area stuff reset sort frustrating would recommend game others pls make game fun remember watching vids game finally could get game fun way different positive review gamer babies expected either nothing unreasonable amount things change since alpha potential thats thing everyone forgot aboutthis game infinite growth potential fan would know planned updates havent rolled still comingthis game grow fun alluring truly adventure game people mad actual state game let rephrase thisthis game kindof early access grow change timejust dont jump conclusions wait pretty cool game play like pretty decent pretty fun game regional items annoying pretty good pretty good changes made little weird get used againstill somewhat feels like original played hoursbetter friends pretty good game tho game alpha compairing unfair stands merits pretty good rpg progression unique admittedly little grindy still fun beta classic rpg rules like leveling everything needs follow thatsets slight mental roadblock items get turned trash explore thats progression reverse happens rpgs everything scales absurd numbers instead resets want explore current area unique bad people think unique bad kinda dissapointed cant really describe good game friends without starting think bad due afromentioned unique progression choices probably one best games ever played year old male iowa looking love affection life wake every morning thinking something fun end making small figurines toothpaste caps father collects factory grandparents live infact lay around eat share hard earned food may life get better soon girls fyiihaveonefriend snapchat progress practically non existent loved previous version though bet bit modding could fixed possibly future update reallly awesome game play hours hours de bad thing get weapong new world meh isi pisi really good really good game could play days without getting tired really good lot fun along alpha really nice game enjoyed even though changed lot alpha still buy worth region lock lev system gone game big gay alpha region lock weird fun region locking gear equipment isnt good mechanic game still alot fun tho region locking items artifacts get useless like swimming yea useful game artifacts gives minor buff percent shitjust dont waste money game buy something valuableand wish wollay fix game dont think ever come unless six years removing progression outstanding move review good right game sucks even close alpha edition fun save money game worth current state seeing xp system change really disappointing way mods handel discussion forums disgraceful play min dont wanna support furthur dont get started region item locks shit could sth good simple little game worth paly smh game already perfect new version bs missing much smooth mechanics great downloaded game minutes ago working fine crashed wont load many good features removed runs like actual trash pc alpha runs perfect glad still cracked alpha game refunded sad lots great things game tied unplayable ones game many know bit rocky history creator pulled try finish started really respectprosthe general feel moving around events pretty fun future updates opening game steam workshop could expand make world populated terms contentthe weapon system fun able choose weapons fly great way change combatchanging job skills another great touch personally wish changing subclass currently improved onthis game hekin cute love look pretty much everything fun brightfinding items region quite satisfying changes travel uncover areaconsthe combat quite shallow controls well falls short bit attack small attack game would benefit form deeper skill system even ability find skills world equip could class specific others generali havent used crafting system gear find comes fast enough even bothering craft equipment almost waist time regards would ether focused crafting part bosses monsters drop materials craft better weapons simplified crafting something bit easier terms make found many apples travels recipes actually used themall items region lockedthe creator stated wanted game figure create sense exploration adventure discovering unknown felt wandered adjacent land boat disappeared bag items specific area even equipment lost value left starting zone fix would make key items like boat rewards larger dungeon player explores find hints items around maybe theres one item like per region stands could start bare bones walk literally anywhere world start fresh wherever went simply start fresh every time havent leveled hours playing gameif levels arbitrary game might actually benefit level system place make purely exploring finding better loot even skills level sits nothing feels really weird player since dont level enemies fighting seems really arbitrary since youll usually find gold per monster fightoverall really like game headed direction want expecting hope game continues grow improve time goes least open steam workshopim recommending hope keep striving become fantastic game sooo play like hours good luck get good weapon clear house get story region go get useless artifacts seeing boost mode travel find region separately become useless seeing find shrine fast travel location yeah sorry im done needed rant go back alpha mod still really fun super fun game would one best market bigger fanbase constant updates super fun friends although dislike dont get keep strength gear mobile utilities like boats gliders enter new region mods fix game developer seemingly disappeared wollay come back super sad takes new approach exploration rpg genre im loving tbh like game thing run around parkourtrickshots tbh imma lil sad dissapointed still pretty fun tbh game ok like games like get bit repetitive good game thats think know everyone hates people thought game would promised could

wollay releasing amazing game years well wasted game changed lot remember dont like levels ill give tryrpg fanand fix multiplayer plslets hope next updates fix thatty game woolay forpls woolay fix seriously fan base u caremake rpg pls alpa game much better relased game way game fed becose get everything one tilte move another one cant use op stuff start everything get tiltle uslles go another title like game downgraded alpa worth buying tldr simplifies poor choice progression mechanics leads counter intuitive play would expect adventure game decent system highly unbalanced favor harshly punishing player wanting explore everything see right see region bordersthe full extent issues comes places game advertised adventure rpg open world things rpg element comes overall class choices base classes specializations doesnt really matter equipped youll fight pretty much way simple tank spank shoot move stun lock targets playstyles much rpgso progression equipment wear tools find within region bound region alone making want explore new zone real degree start way bottom means equipment travel tools find everything stripped functional put perspective basic gear white quality star however see zone powerful bringing gear previous zone previous zone gear brought grey star quality progression loop stuck withgear exists though sure fire way get rng could luck get full set current region making neighboring region much easier gear however thats extent gear anything beyond also becomes worthless rare useful means player trading economy good finds point holding onto gear youve explored surrounding regionsin zone get tools store page showcases like hang glider boat tools biomes essential things moment leave region lose till go back good luck exploring ocean biome boat anymore get jump swim nearest island hope boat thereclasses bit unbalanced comes rpg territory mages squishy powerful warriors tanky damaging rogues squisy evasive heavy crit damage rangers shoot afar slow enemies thats extent class customization minimalist used robust long time agothe games decent quality see music well done doesnt wear thin hours playing keeps certain level fitting situation simplistic graphic design well done unique also looked like trove thing occasional problems building dungeon design beta might persist full release version aware usually big deal thoughall though cant recommend game must pick around signs glaring gameplay issues ever changing itll never really rpg infinite progression artifact system makes one get makes move bit faster form another boosts eventually cap much infinite progression system caps things alpha version waaaay better still okay alpha better every way alpha better spent years get rid xp system skill tree lol alpha better alpha better alpha better less buggy thiswhy would remove perfectly functional xp skill tree systems alpha better pls add back leveling system seed feture dont wanne play game go another zone best beta downgrade alpha say please wollay support encourage modding make changes game please beta better full release beta better combat good much exploration leveling happend alpha version playd alpha friends house good happend like alpha newer version one ddos attack wollays website left traumatized hes longer capable directly interacting others internet pleas better system never answered framework something really good needs time finalize two person team may take say early access im sure doesnt game changed lot seven yearssadly personally wont recommend game sure give chance maybe likin game dog shitwollay ran away release money good job reddit game fun game fun first hrs realized left region back weak started miss progression thought would build mods coming help fix issue painful play find new boat time want explore regions would recommend buying goes worth game fun play isnt much sense progression think reworks gonna make better game fun super grindy game fun ive waiting game come time enjoy however game needs much added like tutorial monsters wont tap game funny game pretty good bosses unbeatable regenerate almost instantly making give beating certain areas even five star items mobs still one hit makes sense whatsoever pretty fun game rough trust developer game extremely unenjoyable gear based progression unrewarding unsatisfying pray rng progress character killing enemies absolutely pointless time real motivation even get one shot time note skill tree makes confusing uninteresting cant even pick improve skills locked character whats point even classes youre gonna im even going get idiotic region locking items adventure based exploration rpg game right call self rpg current state skill trees clear character progression wollay took everything made cubeworld great threw garbage dont understand miss makes game great working years used love cubeworld still love alpha reason im refunding want see wollay responds backlash game still good region locked items mods removes adds cool stuff say worth game still beta takes roughly hours solo explore every biome see everything game offer levelling pointless literally nothing want like game youre looking rpg experience play alpha wait modders fix game game isnt good anymore game isnt used bewe waited years thiswollay please bring back old cube world game seemed decently fun first got hours almost completely finished starting area decided time move turns equipment region locked feature made game unplayable megranted items end resistant stop working edge radius rather crossing border better still bad game sucks get good stuff gos new area dies deletes progress game crapalhpa better game wont even run poorly optimized rendering new terrain take minutes play alpha much better didnt buy pirate something game would better everything wasnt region locked games starting point might little bit hard low grade equipment low resourcesbut thats learning curve experienced something unfamiliar people eventually get around itit still solid game though get wollays idea region locking items starting fresh biome players cant mow everything explore new biome acquire legendary geari hope future would combine alphas core mechanics game gameplay self good problem lack incentive keep exploting due really good effects relics give remuval levelling fro alfa mod like gameplay good game idea game good however way implemented poorly items locked biome found items leave region reduced nothing achieve biomes ludicrously small progress movement visual upgrades ex lantern light radius progress tiny easy get upgrades requires several hours complete biome artifacts artifacts gives upgrades chosen per biome often artifacts require hightest level gear biome give progress game seems designed biome hard restart tiny noncombat related upgrades gear locked biome find means transporting also locked biome location items like glider boat leash essential moving around displayed map go find dont recommend game current state new game still fun entertaining would recommend anyone even fun friends new mechanics much meso guess id better go back play alpha version better lot negative reviews points make sense single player multiplayer find starting new region enjoyable fun see enemies easy one region kicking butts next one thing agree wish kept key transportation item get new region friends game loners game potentially one best rpgs pc years ago remains hollow husk wearing mask great idea game full release less content alpha ill never know let corpse lesson importance continual communication feedback completely demolished feeling progress replacing lvling system minor movement buffs get spending around hour completing zone massacred boynot worth money anymore

sure maybe wanna enjoy twenty minutes find something else waiting six years game come rough release unheard legend massive proportions get equivalent anakin killing children episode three totally uncalled crapfest obviously hiding behind curtain bad feels pretty fun multiplayer game however unintuitive really odd choices especially game centered around exploration plus side art still phenomenal controls pretty tight thanks region locking real felling ever earning anything makes game good common man play minute already know good current point recommend game people believe lot potential many problems game easilysemi easily fixed future updates look forward instead actually recommend game still incomplete still pretty ight game needs continued love support dev community look forward dev game come future wollay introduced many new concepts good paper roguelitestyle progression regions failed satisfying player longterm well snap back start nearly beginning ie concievably grind plus items make journey regions easier incredibly deleterious regarding games immersion factor made level still feel like new player much chagrinthe charm still mired behind halfbaked decisions

support want cube world big listen take region lock itens wonderful game new game much fun worth try hope fix servers worth worth wait worth waiting yearsedit wasnt would better years heavily updated currently hours entertaining gameplay bad would prefer mix alpha current state feel starting makes enjoyable search cool new areas explore player progression via skills feels hard inspired continue possible itd nice bring back rpg leveling improving class skills even unlocking letting skills carry region youre still fresh without gold tier items carrying could even make harderimpossible get gold tier easily without grinding levels skills shine fun time friends explore find challenging bosses wouldnt worth coin wow devs yeah yeah different original cube world essence still zelda cubes makes

also need fix items find one inside rock dont ask got also items one area one locks last thing need fun hours gets annoying think fun game start slow past fase really fun youd better playing trove yoyo yep good game mechanics discourage combat exploration rng hurts character progressionsix years ago cube world voxelbased action rpg released world alpha build though originally light content game managed hook players sometimes hundreds hours due satisfying intuitive gameplay mechanics many today would see cube world game others would see dream idea joining friends slaying ever powerful foes essentially boundless infinite world destructible terrain unique concept appealed backed game many years agoshortly release alpha updates game halted community heard little developer believing game abandoned many gave hope game ever updated others like believed game would eventually released would check online every months see news posted game developer long wait unfortunately disappointed game become please understand reason recommending game current state differs original roadmap though basically bought game back experience system gameplay mechanics stand discourage combat exploration hinder sense character growthbeing longer system character gains experience progression gearbased problem current implementation system opposed steady growth experience system random number generator control characters strength get lucky get legendary drops monsters quests others get two coins gear character class cannot equip also aside bosses enemies drop one two coins regardless strength rarely enemies drop item called leftovers identified back town turns piece equipment likely equipment class warp town identify items adds nothing compared enemies dropped weapons aside wasting time skills character unlocked getgo inability upgrade skills another factor harming sense characters progression strengthmoney serves little use game twelve hours playing game buy single thing besides starting gear fill open equipment slots found best way get better gear lure highlevel enemies npcs kill rather killed enemies maybe got unlucky drops experience get better equipment needed kill enemies significantly stronger kill enemies significantly stronger needed better equipment essentially character progression frustrating experience methis part mention region locking region locking mechanic equipment strength nullified entering different region mechanic makes legendary equipment weaker characters original starting equipment yes heard right thought locking character progression behind random number generator bad enough want realize icing cake since better equipment options shops locked behind quests using money basically buy back starting equipment new region found discouraged entering new regions thus hampering ability explore world heard exists plus equipment used adjacent regions entire time played come across single piece equipment region locking poor choice game mechanic according human psychology humans prefer avoid losses acquiring equivalent gainsin cube world find difficult kill enemies star rating greater weapon furthermore magic based creatures powerful need strong gear fight well point want complete last location region need better equipment kill witch castle trying complete could try craft equipment would need bunch boring resource farming materials craft equipment problem finish castle equipment make get nerfed moving next region makes really want may get lucky see plus gear crafting looking forward resetting day inn constantly look forward grinding coins afford thisthe full release cube world brings forth full quest system unfortunately thrilled implementation system experience involved spamming npcs gave quests markers personally feel like quest markers discourage exploration much better design event occur place map marker player enters area quest dungeon point hoping get better gear would rush quest marker trying avoid enemies much incentive kill essentially means spent much time walking straight line without really engaging world upon finishing quests little gained getting tired getting gear could equip class furthermore little variation quest system regions quickly get feeling playing game repeatedly dont see advantage going certain place kill monsters quest beta versus exploring killing monsters experience alpha beta tells go alpha encourages explore find boss slaythere issues game would like mention twelve hours played yet come across sort dungeon besides castle yet get artifact starting believe none starting region apparently boosts artifacts give character mediocre consisting upgrades like slightly larger lamp radius perhaps increase swimming speednothing resembling satisfying character progression despite bonuses working worldwide terrain generation ocean biomes taken noticeable drop quality compared ocean biomes alpha version game signs life found oceansnot even fish hang glider less useful requiring use half stamina offset initial nosedive another issue lack fog war hide undiscovered parts map takes much excitement knowing discover explorationin short many us cube world live dream new mechanics added discourage exploration combat harm sense character progression fundamental level work basic human psychology dungeons scarce artifacts useless quest system quickly becomes boring enough content locations make traveling feel like chore though bright note aside ocean biomes terrain generator creates breathtaking vistas fantastic music sets atmosphere perfectly disappointing best way define gamewhat started promising base relaxing video game experience shifted throughout years closeddoor development rather confused mess abandoned rpg characteristics favor roguelight experiencethe end result repetitive gameplay loop consists hunting loot region ready take specific dungeon houses artifact acquiring artifacts region player supposed move next one start
