shooting still fun guns feel bit balanced previous game due able duel wield one handed weapons well put together frequently similar almost repeated areas main characters almost always unlikable made pretty obvious trailers fall trope frequently effect women games obsession daddy like daddy finding daddy remembering daddy making daddy proud etc basically reboot lara croft without destroying remains cultures stealing stuff positive think least nice tech expert friend would usually used frequent jokes constant dismissal similar main characters loses good commentary previous games regarding things like main characters jewish identity combined looking like model nazi ideal minorities socialists ones stand nazis americas culture influenced nazis support supremacy replaced characters talking nazis interactions wider world apart stories told mostly daddy growing upconstantly gets way enjoyment heavily armored time wasting enemies hurt previous game worse called reinforcements game makes use borderlands style leveling system enemies strong kill second two bullet sponges never quite bad borderlands though game likes place enemies right next low level ones prevent following normal path progression go large map area leaving hub able complete almost everything everything area instead due levels awful basically nonexistent map jump back force areas one two activities time possibly forgetting missions right next due poor objective organization weapon upgrade system fine part every weapon gives bonus headshots general damage capacity use least three upgrades fine get weapons like

aaaallllll way back last leastyour sister game system requirements high runs really well machine amd medium graphics runs problem explosions make go seconds performanceas gameplay think far good get right action brand new enemy types cant play multiplayer dont friends powerful enough computer singleplayer good like wolfenstein multiplayer games good game definitely wolfenstein iii game created mixed feeling enjoy gameplay trying time feels friend thoroughly enjoying multiplayer campaign think enjoy much definitely see people dislike game would never buy play didnt multiplayer mode definitely wait sale overall game feels like extended dlc sorts starters sjw women power game room temp iq idiots think game fun point theres side missions outside main storyline dont really interest extra xp ability points main storyline however fairly interesting hours youve completed game definitely shows didnt really care game core part wolfenstein series constant coop interactions tedious enemies spawning front behind gets annoying longer play gun play alright different types armour enemies makes interesting way use one gun see annoyance looting constant collectables makes finding things pointless half game youre spamming e random things dont even end looking journal aside needing decode floppy disks tldr game bearable hours time take finish starters game denuvo drm bethesda respect customer need bethesdanet account absolutely reason completely dispel illusion game paid also sad attempt condition future bethesda games removed steam use shitty bethesdanet launcheras game unclear called wolfenstein remove name game nothing suggests kind relation wolfenstein anything id software ever done without wolfenstein name would think mediocre clone mediocre borderlands space nazis made someone like city interactive would look game twiceyou play insufferable cunts whose sole mission life annoy use weapons boring derivative form function make long precise tight responsive feel weapons wolfenstein design characters enemies mostly ugly especially armor helmets girls look like someone tried copy dead space understand made design work girls least cute sexy fun around way game could something im sure bethesda made girls ugly purpose leftist sjws likely nobody bethesda knows make aesthetically pleasing females humans general effort put making elizabeth great character great companion made bioshock infinite great effort made design plot gameplay mechanics second character standin bot human coop playerand cherry top shit sundae course microtransactions absolutely disgusting disrespectful conclusion nobody buy play game want coop replay gears war want shooter companion character play bioshock infinite want shooter rewards skill ability aim also one forcing rpg elements wolfenstein series likely worst combination ive seen entire life looking forward theyre going unfck next wolfenstein use crappy mechanicedit almost forgot good job adding microtransactions singleplayer game lmao series story driven intense action fps didnt want coop schlooter super disappointing ashes semidisaster new colossus arose youngblood put new life wolfenstein gameplay refreshingly new easy pick understand nazis look part bonus though played ai theres multiplayer feature im sure hella fun another person graphics fantastic characters likable game features new leveling system makes certain enemies harder sometimes impossible higher level missions theres maps want shoot shit outa nazis without friend game youhowever im pretty sure reason computer literally blew playing since ive heard shit people crash bunch sometimes crash computers entirely didnt get far really feel like shouldnt return fix major bugs intensely fun game brought back old blood days hope day continue fuck good game fun first gameplay gets repetetive characters also terrible living proof todays gaming industry focused forcing political agenda throats instead making good game fun co op focused loot shooter game exactly says box best people complaining expecting next wolf even though clearly labeled different go figure fun coop worth around hours play guns feel bit lacking price right fun first hours flaws quickly become apparent grinding looter shooter without loot rewarding sense progression played division thought lets slap stink fun game clearing area exploring

since play see bethesda going game want us side nazis cant say much game played hour played garbage hour horrible worth playing maybe little spending dollars game playing new wolfenstine games joke would rather play though others means game bust mention overwhelming amount others leaving reviews saying game crashing might play longer cannot good faith recommend game atleast full price even friend play played start finish friend cant comment companion ai completed game togetherthat said best game youre somewhat efficient quests whatnot even amazing still bad terms value opinion game short still microtransactions doesnt affect personally blankly ignore part game however still scummy really find positive game gunplay overall feels fairly good time short cant recommend full price heavy sale sure got friend play cannot recommend game anyone looking actual wolfenstein game open world loot shooter mechanics rpg elements added bad idea imo hard even call wolfenstein game tried refund almost hours playing learn cant refund hours play learned lesson today lol couldnt hours game missed every mark set previous titles much loved game seems none charm gate story jumps around erratically twins shy instagram influencer obnoxious nothing like would expect blazkowicz household combat alien none quests seemed make sense graphics look like fell old blood good title time nothing compared new colossusif love microtransactions leveling constant stream ui elements loot hunting high fives main characters act like teenagers discovered cuss words game love wolfenstein maybe save silver coins enjoy bit boring beginning much harder lvl upgrade gear etc becomes tiny bit easyer still easy finish game must say like lot still make game good enough enjoy game update caused lose save progress didnt like game beginning recent patch playing hrs think best wolfenstein date patch made nice difference single player like save points loot also set difficulty level casual regular hard casual may touch easy game like predecessors sandbox game linear expected new different format experience wolfenstein evolve die good game like playing people single mode good graphics great like looking sister would better self still great dont even know begin one game fun play good representation machine games wolfenstein series everything made wolfenstein games fun ie single player progression ability choose approach certain situations needing put bullets nazi kill etc completely devoid instead arkane machine games opted new formula game play consists apparent convoluted confusing rendition looter shooter lite rpg doesnt work series ultimately makes game feel like wasnt originally intended wolfenstein game reskinned piggy back successful franchise paper two player coop wolfenstein game sounds like great idea shouldnt main focus gameit shouldve optional feature whereas original linear game play mechanics progression remained intact feels though developers heads vision wanted game ultimately unable achieve whatever going bad game cant mad developers wanting try something new especially known making rpgs looter shooters rather linear single player stories understanding somewhat passion project respect however unless things game get seriously overhauled namely enemy nerfs playing alone ability play game single player without ai cant recommend anyone buy game even hardcore wolfenstein fans like dont get hate game ruff start yes good fun play didnt encounter bugs great coop game friend dont ai fixed ok actually useful sneak stays back doesnt raise alarms lvl system fine long play missions order use right weapons end game treasure hunt came across enemy ridiculous amount hp gameplay fell like wolfenstein characters stupid yes didnt bother easy ignore saying u focus killing stuffthere another negative thing tho length game really short u finish everything side quests add ons find collectibles beside great game dont know say get game turned one favorite franchises h lets see hell yeah dudethere pause buttonthere respawn enemies area like second agothere arent enough bullets kill enemiesthere zero sense ai controlled companion revive call providing health armor deadthere storythere nothing side missions wait side missions random things given new assignments completethese happened first four hours gameplay prepared see new cr next hours think enough turn people dont buy game unless want feel sweet ss regretedit microtransaction dont leave critical reviews often feel like part duty add list herewolfenstein youngblood installment series however feel attached two original stories say gameplay greatly differs first two games playing series together row game seem jarring abrupt changethis installment heavily implements arcadestyle like approach enemies combat enemies health bars leveling system quite literally prevent blasting game game easily beatable within hoursb please keep mind purchasing game unless like level characters weapons max level reason even hours game crashed randomly twice save file became corrupt gave choice start clean slate twicei honestly gave game chance however writing story weak unfortunate develop attachments characters world exist within previous installations kinda destroy bjs character world one hopeful save series within next installation series dont like multiplayer games one play ai stupid liked every wolfestain far also liked changes making like rpg customizable guns dont understand many people negative experience game absolutely loved story line good changes game new order enjoyable loved back forth two twins thought setup interesting future franchise played coop yetlooking forward dont know negativity coming game style wolfenstein coop good sound nice impact weapons pretty good level map design certainly worth enjoy positives personally like healthbars like use different ammunition get certain enemies armor makes sense like humorous bit less scary love amusing ai companion adds humor think hub travel back nice makes seem like actually rebels trying take back city bit time also think good kraftwork weapons instead choosing lastly think nice play female game thisnegatives dont like borderlands level bullet sponge levels health bullet sponge different ammunition taking time get certain parts enemy armor till fall yes thats fine mags grunts bare head hes levels higher reallyi get essentially test seeing wolfenstein think take continue shouldnt continued doesnt fit theme hope wolfenstein isnt end series though seems like starting look new things put series questionable others lovely think thats something people forgetting complaining games rpg elements introduce really awesome new things wellyou tell major games game though enjoy game enjoy game done one wolfenstein series way back ultimate baddass retrun wolfenstein castle master piece play still play couple times year start finish never gets old wolfenstein say sensational times begining something awesome come knew havent disappointed yet one sort sucked thats okay everyone allowed least mulligan got cyberpilotvr blast wolfenstein hand developrs kept thyme right tee relate exact fears laughter awa wha wahthe elite guard never dull moment game thing humor usual action packed need use brain little good done far giving complaint right cant keep enough ammo get tough times learn learning strategy combat scenios challaning like others exactly cup tea dock um half point making work hard dont know lazy enjoyed playing youngblood found pretty good funny liked new approach weapon system rpg element must say story seems shorter previous games doesnt make bad opinion story ending potential problem story canon missions ended feeling last mission missions bit boring wait play bj wolfenstein enjoyed playing game pretty much wolfenstein collection played entire thing solo one issue ai elevator rode elevator back back able continue liked story player progression weapon leveling pause solo wasnt really big issue still would nice game currency option pay interfere game play mainly purchasing skins faster wanted think melee weapon could purchased currency good game enjoyed game lot possibly also finally able get swastikas everything else legal germany without download modsthe game ist quite fun whole load different weapons combined bunch skillsi dont like listening people im giving opinion really like game exclusively play friend great cracks us time personally love interactions twins together expected wolfenstein experience added benefit friend tagging along experience hour campaign characters grow love cutscenes draw story choices weigh heavily experiencethe trailers made us expect typical still exciting experience one gotten new order old blood new colossus nothing trailers highlighted would playing claustrophobic map grinding level high enough kill handful enemies disallowed progression high level us best experience boring repetitive major disappointment togetheri played game almost hours amount time would taken beat ones felt like made next progress yeah could played longer period time played game long would taken beat one onesif recall new colossus decodable intel strips got killing officers normal campaign could take back sub use find location important nazi figures could kill side missions entire game thats felt like one large side mission fiasco first level except isnt optional even side missions nc better levels still unique fun blast throughi love games probably go back play future mood strikes even old blood short story somewhat lacking amount gameplay runs circles around titleim downright disappointed cant even argued title cost half much others shouldnt expected type content old blood cost aside somewhat short still fun game good progression story cared borderlands done badlyand care story watch cutscene movie youtube youll get experience little get new colossus little half new order gave us least dont grind achieve watch twins mess around elevator loading screen involves one finished game yesterday singleplayer think generally good gamepros good shooting movement feeling nice upgradable movement actions like fast sidestrafing upgradable weapon options like environments although bit similar times interesting coop revive option daily weekly missionscons short good story previous games series ai companion coop could improved dialogues unnecessary politicalsuggestions improvements ai crouch without becoming invisible ai companion automatically go sneak mode doesnt call revive move towards continuing fighting enemies sometimes continues fighting without helping die lose shared life genuinely enjoyed expect hours playtime feels reasonable priceits lovely narrative continuation spoilercracks idverse wide openspoiler b sets especially dramatic stage next main sequence releasetheres bugs work outas always series seemsand superbly optimized run anything modestly better gaming potatotmif youre running nvidia make sure latest version graphics drivers seems playing new features hood got game didnt expect much unhappy able play bjthe characters decent know cringy admit make

let know great shooter get past ai partner annoyances guess yes play im series fan hunting nazis always funwhat likedlearning evolution bj family team membersthe action pretty decent graphics goodwhat didnt likethe two girls side conversation wore whileif got low ammo big fight got killed id start ok low ammo dont understand pause feature better safe place need bathroom break occursif f sister got injured image showing location always factual makes big battles tough cant trust need go assist team mateif series fan like play know different wolfenstein single player experiences youve never played wolfenstein id recommend new order colossus first fun experience coop great time playing game obviously meant cooperative play designed around however played entire game single player playing coop honestly say really dont see everyone angry feel many fans comparing game previous games flawed comparison previous wolfenstein games primarily story driven single player big budget aaa games youngblood next sequel wolfenstein series lets get way minimal story cut scenes sold half price new colossus game offers something like borderlands destiny looter shooter cooperative experience without loot better shooting better environments realistic level scaling system youngblood well shooting gritty mix cover shooting push forward combat even better especially friend really blend two styles first ai pretty great choose play solo sisters ai competent zero moments dumb ai either enemies would stuck supposed annoying ai sister flank less tries stay close sadly doesnt take advantage great environments makes boss battles significantly challenging far dumb use pep signals well come save call go definitely holds enemy ai also competent never experienced moments ai would shake head always moved acted varied still fairly predictable way exactly want ai nazis second leveling system actually enjoyed personally hate leveling systems fps games experience hardcore leveling difficulty issues exception one time early clearly tried enter area meant later game also really like leveling system never felt phony like every rpg make weak looking enemies complete bullet sponges reason enemies level become tougher show wearing significantly armor gear higher levels tiers never feels fake enemies complete bullet sponges instead always die reasonable number shots third environments completely top notch visually fun play well crafted every area seems multiple routes either player go leftright highlow perfectly suited cooperative shooting arenas amazing play incredibly detailed perhaps beautiful realistic environments seen online game comparable graphics would expect see single player campaign graphics shy detail new colossus gripe levels simply enough enough different environment types finally shooting absolutely amazing sure borderlands better loot billion guns shoot honestly none guns feel satisfying enjoyed shooting new order new colossus love shooting able play cooperatively priceless wolfenstein mix sneaking cover shooting balls push forward combat done perfectly allowing players filling role respectively honestly preferred shooting shooting new colossus many times new colossus switch cover firing dual shotgun charging often quickly survive effectively whereas one player focus upgrade one direction allowing player focus good end would definitely recommend game worth money many times feel negative reviews simply kids false expectations would expect experience would expect great single player campaign story cut scenes cooperative online shooter feel many negative reviews prefer apples new order new colossus orange youngblood failing entirely appreciate differences high hopes game really enjoyed others franchise disappointed story awful game play games leveling horrible get game bucks maybe worth otherwise refund like fact turned open world wish linear minutes playtime play nothing good say titlei rooting bad guys win feel like made people last wolfenstein games top line pc constantly crashes get game hours game alright inspected thought option play coop single player nope coop host join game progress buddy pass impressed absolutely idea game got poor reviews could give thousand positive reviews would pros cons like game significant wolfenstein feel chemistry relationship two blazkowicz twins endearing downright cute times still tenacious dedication stopping nazis like fatherboth twins similar character contrasts similarities bj good job portraying similarities two girls fatherone complaints ive heard game enemies bullet sponges game didnt play smoothly problem game fps titles ive played difficult enemies take abuse lower difficulty enemies go paths progression level weapons upgrade well leveling upgrading character nonissueif looking mindless give everything need ill go around killing everything fps granted game looking game involved fun play definitely game youi could go feel title huge fan direction taken story two twins purists say ruins game played since beginning think youre forgetting two previous wolfenstein titles came wolfenstein new order titles didnt kill franchise nothing willinstead feel inclusion two female main characters story great approach fresh different direction played franchise since wolfenstein far favorite installment franchise yeti would absolutely recommend game anyone playing wolfenstein youngbloods friend bought deluxeversion playing free buddy pass included deluxeversion gunplay feels really good levels really intricate interesting marred goddamn silver coinsystem implemented order buy upgrades weapons use silver coins scattered levels increments pieces boxes containing silver coins upgrade costs silver coins lot upgradesthe reason sucks screws flow gameplay often scenario get area fun mowing everyone spend next minutes scouring every nook cranny get effing silver coins since silver coins instanced means players pick coins never miss loot good also means never really split either go area get available lootand makes coop kind pointless opinion also collectibles including readables floppy disks floppy disks need decrypted floppy disks readables usually code codelocked box box likely lot silver coinsso happens run around spam e order pick everything order amass silver coins upgrades floppy disks decrypt obviously need find computer decrypt order get codes boxes lock get silver coins upgrade weapons crushed enemiesthe silver coins really screws everything makes game come grinding halt would soooo muuuuch better would excluded silver coins collectibles made upgrade using like main entries new order new colossus terrific potential squandered fricking gaasmechanicsi continue play cant really good consciousness wholeheartedly recommend gameedit stopped playing game shortly wrote review didnt start playing raytracingpatch written still stands doesnt bother much reason dont know developers game downtime going back definitely way fun compared game released silver coin system didnt feel intrusive beforei completed game since time way positive changed thumbs thumbs completed game core gameplay fun gunplay bit fastpaced puzzle style requiring use certain guns best dispatch certain enemies story fun enough although definitely takes back seat wont spoil anything gets existentiali would recommend aiming later achievements extreeeeeemly grindy loved wolfenstein games recently come game mess would constantly disconnected friend glitch underneath map location multiple times entire story takes ish hours broke heart like game much like definite low point series definitely wait sale bethesda goes bankrupt get free playing long already game extremely fun challenging new colossus thats ok different type game folks say theres like character previous two three old blood games disagree think character different one way slick two good time yet played whole story playing best friend beer good game truly amazing co op experience play alone fulfilling experience co op mode best story far works gameplay incredible shooting dgraphic hair soundmusic nice doom graphical settings got sooooooo many settings truly something everyone like played game couple days great far action super fast paced hectic intense music go lot like doom overall gameplay reminds bit nazi themed rage lots little rpg elements going totally sandbox like skyrim anything critiqued cringey interactions sisters wolfenstein top silly themed game day one keeps going funny ridiculous oklots lore funny silly nazi details place much love wolfenstein games would loved others coop hence excitement thought one garbage though real main mission levels entire game rest cringeworthy side missions stealth elements game foolish unless want endlessly toss op throwing knives dont add silencer anything better yet dont buy game endless spawning new enemies already trod areas seconds leaving makes every move slog final feminist note two three female leads portrayed empty unintelligent childish laughed previously posted complete review say game kind r h honestly dont understand hate people bear title yes rpg shooter id rather classic fps experience well done amusing story good gameplay smooth well worth price let alone grabbing discount getting deluxe edition grabbing friend coop makes proper fun experienceill agree one recurring comment though sisters random dialogue rather cringy xd honestly really like game feels like like rpg like aspects kinda weird mostly stuff like base damage upgrades stuff doesnt make much difference opinion bullet spongy enemies fun kinda adds chaos health bars annoying though stress personally bad thing opinion lot people also mad ai sister single player part game remember game made coop game worth bucks half price normal full game deluxe edition practically gives another copy friend game begs play someone else times better way anywaysdont waste money game one play honestly recommend game im huge fan series ive waited quite lot play feel free invite game note like play stealth lot xd initially gave game bad review ive changed mind think received poorly fans wolfenstein series wasnt wanted expected tried like initially wasnt fun year since release decided give game good second chance put hours see would improve surprise improve grew began really like game beating id say definitely worth playing probably fun replay devs messed imo abiding fans wanted expected ie wolfenstein love mention theres annoying learning curve players endure begin fun bought game ealier today half price thanksgivingblack fridayautumn saleat first game wouldnt launch returned error code publishers website said related graphics drivers updating latest nvidia drivers game plays butter smooth responsive probably due ids contribution doom always super smoothif like modern wolfenstein series new order old blood new colossus probably like youngblood play one bjs annas twin daughters single player campaign twin npcpartner im assuming play coop partnertwin would player invite game another twist share lives twin revive combat really skeptical first usually npc partners really stupid frequently prone getting killed far though npc twin hasnt much liability still would prefer go solo unfortunately isnt option gameso far couple hours play youngblood pretty good story gameplay naziblasting funfest weve come expect franchise couldnt keep playing played new order new colossus pales comparison coop cringey gets massive plot holes abilities one asked forabsolute travesty last two better fix another far better title franchise lost dont know people keep disliking game played actually good twin sisters interesting characters quite good story like prequel combats smooth good last one system leaning towards rpg side still better less arcade fact compared last oneoh make sure turn enemy health bar thats ridiculous wolfenstein keep seeing lot reviews trashing game like borderlands made want play dont like looter shooters bought anyway im glad majority negative steam reviews accurate classifying game looter shooter comparing destiny borderlands looter shooter implies weapons equipment gradually become obsolete longer play turn must grind get best equipment equipment work higher level enemies however grinding weapons better stats special abilities looter shooters good weapons found random percentage game works playing game exploring levels gives money money upgrade equipment low money cannot upgrade likely didnt explore enough spent money wrong things skinswith way game fun friend really appreciate buddy pass thing wish games letting friends owner play free great feature hope see games future mainly bought gameplay setting therefore opinion story probably use review enjoying gameplay setting kind liked departure general formula think lot could explored without involving bj two characters boring forgettable tho game pretends looter shooter nothing interesting loot far understand could theoretically level content pretty much gone whole game seems like confused wanted hardly actual narrative virtually characters talking heads could barely understand radio chatter gunplay pretty good really redeemable part game along gun modding skill perks things game pay locking items behind paywalls weird content game runs day two dont know weirdo went way buy weapon character armor skins game daily missions someone wants log every day play minutes reason beat everything really could extended something interesting compellingoverall would say game bad doesnt know wants would rather game absolutely connection bj family main plot straightforward looter shooter like fallout side game made clear players sidestory stands feels like bizarre combination several genres entire game feels unevenful doesnt even feature bj playable missions anything remotely interesting hitler killed screen inbetween release game previous presumably go back continue story bj next release massive step fun gritted teeth know game get sterling reviews story length bit underwhelming however cannot really play wolfenstein game expect good story admittedly would bonus play shooting things specifically nazis game delivers spadesi thoroughly enjoyed relatively small maps lot content explore also played exclusively still enjoyed ai sister back reminisced borderlands second wind mechanic die sister revive allows play bit recklessly take chancesso personally really enjoyed game though believe objectively may good game youd expect werent bugs experienced animations ai voice acting etc good theres nothing game amazing excellent nothing would take breath away still enjoyed know girls get nerves little old thing said enjoyed game would recommend like gme

buy im noticing lot downvotes game seems sort expectations preconceptions game experiencing technical difficulties game far lot funfirst im blast literally nazi body parts everywhere first expectation metsecond heavy weapons mean doesnt like using lasers literally melt nazis unexpected expectation metthird melee stealth kills hatchetwin im fence recommending game ultimately decided give thumbs rare coming age story led almost exclusively female charactersyoull like game view primarily arkane studios given wolfenstein assets something powerful story based games new order new colossusthe story also whereas bj contemplative full trauma unpack jessie sophia two dorky teens coming age journey bj would internal monologue elevator daughters would sass prank otherif want arcadey shooter massacring nazis game great expecting good good nonc storytelling well sorry im going give game thumbs due coop side play friend id strongly go game looking play dont even bother trying play many said youll deal horrible ai companion cant play either friend ai companion go game togetherthe sisters game beyond joke act like little kids theres quite bit cringe acting espically elevator speaking elevators pretty annoying open every single elevator friend want go somewhere else progress game graphics wolfenstein youngblood average honesty im running game maxed nothing impressive honestly looks like video game terms graphicsenemies arent exactly smart killed ease comes killing youll feel like youre shooting sponge amount bullets absorb finally diegame play wise pretty solid games well done nice upgrades tweak around weapon see fit purchased coins collect earn game either environment killing enemies finishing missions ill cut youll enjoy game play friend otherwise id recommend giving pass ive enjoyed since played mate thats reason im giving thumbs im interested narrative driven singleplayer games older gamer loved previous entries wolfenstein series despite red flag bethesda repurposing traditionally singleplayer game cooperatively focused thought id give try understand theyve gone business direction potential monetisation live service model blah blah shouldve cautioned trying youve played fallout appreciate direction bethesda taking franchises going forward bottom line nothing like previous entries would dissuade anyone thinking trying expecting ill much cautious sequel future im playing lowest difficulty correct level using fully upgraded shotgun right face one super soldiers yet takes like shots face kill guyit really quite easy easy difficulty youre basically invincible wheres fun shooting guy face entire minute doesnt even take damage im pleasantly surprised like new order new colossus however enjoyable fps like homefront revolution far prettier smoother lot fun im pretty sure wondering wolfenstein youngblood worth time think game wolfenstein old blood main meaty game like wolfenstein new order wolfenstein new colossus rather opposite side coinstory wise wolfenstein new colossus ended anya twins two girls fast forwarded around years later girls grown young adults taught life bj anya know defend hunt survive harsh world nazis still threat even hitlers deathblazko blazko one man army goes disappears weird crusade leaving anya girls alone girls worry dad curious vanished go mission find course without asking anyone permission thats basically story plot twists lot nazi killing well usual wolfensteini jumped expecting wolfenstein shooter minimal story nothing crazy basically like wolfenstein games dont need complicated plot games like main aspect shooting nazis beat story took roughly hours easy difficulty still collectibles find side missions try coop might spend moredifficulty isnt braindead rather nice even easy fights challenging enough seek cover actively search supplies ammo tend run go guns blazing ai smart smaller enemies move lot take cover fun fight larger enemies tend attack usually high armor health need bit strategy beatenemy variety great similar previous wolfenstein games new ones well different armor types enemies interesting idea requiring pick correct weapon type defeat themgame leveling system unlockable perks abilities weapon upgrades battle suits cosmetics every weapon level kill enemies increase damage additionally upgrades missions often reward ability points find minicurrency coins city spend upgrades didnt notice anything wrong microtransactions dont use unlocked wanted freely see issue whatsoevergame isnt really grindy nice balance enemy respawn revisiting locations

universe compared much science fiction around keep mind sisters pretty much teens raised boy like girl intensive combat training usually talk like teenage dudes yes nose slang cringe roof remember teenage years werent much different personally didnt issue teens act fool dont make serious basically prepared small age protect also notice mature character story goes closer endenvironments look great similar previous games runs well recommended specs overall well optimized lot detail clutter around city rewarding explore every alley balcony loot collectibles even pick perk help find said

love complain fun like fun things literally matters game good full price buy want fun enjoy interesting story good solid coop fun concerned well tuned fps action modern wolfensteins disappointed one word warning respect learn armor effectiveness works big hurdle lot players simply put try one player either armor type smooth sailing story definitely weak feel something structure coop game encouraging matchmaking strangers want keep story line consistent players something dont know point isnt well paced engaging single player wolfensteins two sisters also pretty obnoxious enjoy suffering think theyre fine easy see would bother people compared billys serious tone game also uses recycles lot content makes missions almost completely disposable go room kill enemies finish objective leave never much however someone rarely plays games narrative obviously enjoy one makes watch long cutsceneswolfenstein youngblood strange entry wolfenstein franchise one goes almost everything modern single players flourish really caught lot people guard isolation however think game lot well big experiment single player game could cohesive coop experience ever changing partnersit

supersoldaten body would shooting nazis always funthe sound design amazing love powerful guns sound even small ones really adds feeling badassery game fails two big fronts story progression minor spoilers aheadmy main gripe america liberated great playing game isnt game recovering america nazi rule sending back europe destroying checkpoints sabotage implementation new government etc instead get title card liberated america oh cool must fun guessfor reason game series killing nazis topic become less less relevant nazi killing become platform launch family drama story another level dont get wrong think really important family tension helps ground story create consequence bjs actions side aspect story want delve deep lore main aspect gamethe twins arent annoying people paint think internet sometimes get issue character wont let go even almost nothing base humor crude times misplaced genuinely funny heartfelt moments game think actresses played good part silly southern teenagers people calling annoying think teenager think less annoying unfunny well werent finally monetization game microtransaction exclusive skins beyond think shows bethesdas continuos desperation squeezing

fun shooter repeating maps annoy people one mission every map plenty fine respawning enemies sometimes annoying shoot upnot yet still fun sale even would work fun rpg shooter fans gunplay isstill great wolfensteins lets start positive aspects game graphics look okayish ultra decent framerates ultra negative log bethesda account learn use steam api almost two minutes unskippable banners game starts ugly menu looks like year olds first unity game menu incredibly unintuitive took minutes figure start campaign main characters look like ripped game cinematics capped wtf screen tearing despite vsync shadows look stripey diagonal lines outofthebox graphics settings garbage see next point example game defaulted monitor full hd something like fun navigating menu blindly blurring interpolation game whole excessive political correctness diverstiy vibe yucks main characters act like pubescent teens really cringy watch cutscene lot long main characters feels like movie really really bad acting whole game feels polished rasp surprisei got game sale still going return even worth lets keep mind full price game story play one daughters bj along sister try find bj overthrow nazis paris help french resistance take headquarters get labx believe bj plot fairly transparent really isnt much terms narration character building build last games kind set rest games series though theyve foreshadowing certain plot elements awhile come fruition annoying though given brief treatment look forward see story goes bj daughters focus moving forward characters characters im mostly going focus daughters friend abby daughter grace wolfenstein ii shadow colossus much less serious juvenile comparison bj sets much lighter tone game overall see development beginning kill first nazi remain incredible static characters abby fairly static well backup tech person sisters think theres lot room characters go hope theyre developed graphics sound graphics good much else say couldnt run max fairly good looking game although nothing impressive environment wise music sound solid immersive like ive come know wolfenstein game nothing revolutionary solid gameplay alright heres thing try way much ends sorta nothing added lvs abilities game unlike theyve also added semi open world roam around inside diff areas various undergrounds also quite side quests semi open areas really tried mix rpg elements fps elements dont think game justice come play wolfenstein im looking awesome story driven linear fps game dont get wrong gunplay stellar always satisfaction killing nazis entirely enemies health bars much tankier world one shot headshots much customization weapons bonuses using weapons none customizations really impacted strength noticeable way enemies mostly still bullet sponges combat became less fluid snappy ended playing game medium higher difficulties enemies far tanky fun abilities decent also never felt like changed gameplay much throwing weapons super strong fun though ill give think gone rpg elements fps elements im alright wolfenstein changing identity want game ends good said however gave games go rpg elements depth satisfying overall impression decent shooter quite live previous games wasnt quite able pick direction ended making overall game weaker still enjoyed enough finish game long game little inclination many side quests decent game get sale still fun moments little bit setup future wolfenstein games like rage cant recommend graphics n stuff look good crashes time cant say good bad like coop maps open ended freedom exploration synthpop covers popular bands levels verticality previous games allowing optional flanking routes certain objectives use perks keep heavy weapons ability remove mounted guns mounts removed game balance guess deluxe version lets invite friends dont game want try outdislike story feels like written radical feminist maps open ended quite walk one end level another damagegated certain weapons ineffective certain types enemy armor levelgated certain enemies certain parts game certain level usually higher forces either sneak past find secret bypass underground unless final boss youre level time fight expect die several times even normal difficulty bj blazkowicz reduced almost husk former self showing climax exposition dont even see taking nazis spectacular fashion everything overshadowed daughters although cheaper previous games half content halved well dont count time spent side quests level character farming currency upgrade weapons deal tougher enemies would amount barely hour two finish main quests guess alternate culture dialogues interactions main characters cringy point entire script feels forced companion ai smart enemy smart ai wolfenstein first doom microtransactions presentwould recommend buying full price wait til discount least long story short wolfenstein meets borderlandsnot sure good idea previous wolfenstein games always great main characters honestly teenage blaskowicz girls strong single player story aimed gameplay quaziopen world repetetive grinding doesnt work well result weakest installment new era wolfenstein games kept playing sake knowing story ends ok killing

william even characters introduced previous titles like anya max hell even side characters game feel weak underdeveloped dont remember anyones names catacombs honestly dont reason help protect seem like give missions example wolfenstein new order side characters seemed like main characters fleshed important plot actual emotions towards world events happening rather saying different lines giving mission two also villains werent bad predictable weak last boss far go series wont spoil anything annoying felt like game could went longer story leading fight pretty bare bones go three different districts find access three towers climb top large buildings fight recycled boss basically clones zerstor enemy almost done game happens awful sounds didnt affect much actually felt like got moneys worth game whereas feel like would felt worse payed deluxe say lot fun playing game especially since dollars deluxe basically gives copy friend play allow someone use whenever long play unlimited play withnow discussed disliked enjoy shooting movement felt good fast awesome like previous titles addition powers suits things like new weapons mechanics helped lot think downside cant dual wield weapon feel twins strong william guess customization done weapons also nice touch skins arent bad want change look every wish little cheaper oh let us forget new enemies like suicide bomber dog favorite

microtransactions although thankfully arent aggressivenitpicks cant listen cassette tapes journal one wants sit menu listen combat takedowns great repetitive incombat knife takedowns called wolfenstein young blood yeah sounds kinda weird follows established naming format past games maybe thats point shit man dont know since rtx update game remains unplayable months intel rtx asus always game switches sceneries level fps drop reasons followed numerous guide fix problems didnt games like control also use dlss rtx work perfectly youngblood wont thanks nice rtx update however said beginning game becomes unplayable even disable rtx dlss function try play nothing slay nazis like theres tomorrow hours game opinion might little premature however feel must express far kind disappointment leveling characters enemies bummer route went unfortunate enemies feel like total bullet sponges game wants grind level character like level determines much damage bullet enemies

wish focused mechanics full wolfenstein games feels like punishment hold hope wolfenstein im hours feel like enough taste far leave comment let preface reviewcomment saying enjoy wolfenstein games always found boring however loved atmosphere trailers saw youngblood figured id give gooff bat game runs really well aging gtx play ultra settings still get average also enjoy rpg elements added upgrade character customize weapons better fit play style something keeps pulling back despite somewhat boring quests level design solid reminds lot dishonored game enjoyed tremendously although incredibly annoying clear area leave minutes come back filled enemies really needs longer cooldown period inbetween spawns biggest grip one biggest features game forced play someone ai partner youre playing alone atrocious want stealth around take nazis axe gonna happen cause ai partner ruin frustrating something im learning look past enjoy aspects gamelastly worth really enjoy interaction commentary sisters even feels bit forced times want thank machine games arkane studios attempt coop shooter im long days coop shooters im glad exists im sure someone play would enjoy experience lot really cant go wrong dont go expecting pure wolfenstein experience youre like may find good thing ive played game hours yet completed thought id post thoughts far basically loved old blood enjoyed new colossus wouldnt recommend buying game game ultimately feels hollow vacuous much like disneys train wreck attempt star wars direction wolfenstein franchise going likely wont buying future titleswill post review completion far im enjoying game although several caveats mention remove friend steam add using bethesda id order us actually play together took half hour figure quite ridiculous additional mechanics dont really add much game would good better entirely linear option change weapon mods pick two suit powers use would likely less fun singleplayeronce get going though game fine characters top bad fun mock gunplay movement pretty spot far least favorite wolfenstein even lower price previous releases felt main story weak idea coop fun executed best mechanics like previous games added rpg elements dont really fit well stealth play bad im really sure could properly fit stealth coop game play soft armored gun swaps doesnt play right since pretty much upgrade shotgun mow everything also

friend play didnt experience partner ai cutscenes lifeless barely character expression music traveling places often shows map highlighted red play area narration probably interesting werent blank white map explain whole thing zero sense direction coordination often found friend wandering endgame level areas hoof back across three areas supposed go put couple hours game could tell main story blocked time consuming side quests feel like filler game basically fallout wolfenstein expected multiplayer entry series instead suffered catch twentytwo story multiplayer mechanics tldr fans wolfenstein franchise could fun friend personally enjoyed gunplay main story solo side quests sending repetitive nature levels draining hour mark goes without mentioning grind youd max every weapon perk unlock everything achievements would nightmare bright side game runs beautifully pick buddy pass version sale worthwhile buy play friendwolfenstein youngblood side entry franchise similar old blood back twist time coop shooter playing bjs daughters years wolfenstein ii ill front new protagonists didnt bother like reviews ive seen rpg style health bars made sense given coop understand bothered give machinegames arkane benefit doubt game trying new things series thats good games industry needs try new things shaking wolfenstein formula side entry good move innovation im sure guess recommending concepts good execution wasnt smooth sadlybefore games release replayed entire mg wolfenstein series max difficulties completing everything could fell back love gameplay story done say didnt hate game fact initial hours exploring killing nazis main points story quite enjoyable worth purchase clearly built progression system like looter shooter completed every main side mission game every collectable replayed mission try new gunsperks done level clear amount time reach level max perks amount money id grind max every attachment time grind every weapon level going absurd ive heard plans add side missions areas anything really want grind areas countless hours care completing stuff like normally enjoy time knew done finished everything game content barely halfway grind isnt even ng option redo content level like borderlands something game even remotely compares series contentnormally like touch every main part games review anyone wants kinds details game ive already gone long enough mixed bag whole main story fun exploring new areas shooting nazis seeing bj hours satisfied albeit light story got continued side content hunting collectables realized small repetitive games numbers rpg systems big content offer clearly hasty side project since im guessing wolfenstein iii still years catch sale play friend give go youre completionist solo player game grueling continue playing story ends final note microtransactions really arent big deal ive seen people making cant pay real money level get perks get attachments anything gameplay pay money get skins power suit weapon skins earnable game currency honestly pretty cheap care enough save silver really cared character guns look grind bit game weapon skins cheaper attachments upgrades actually benefit gameplay suits dont matter much since first person care arent hard grind ultimately feel pointless arent intrusive offered buy gold bars everything purchase easy obtain game money tldr game wank buy sale besti

ago literally could tell single good thing game im even joking say theres nothing good game however theres loooooooooooot st stuff tbh st know fallout apparently developed c b team well game developed fkin z team aright buy game knowing feedbacks reason jake paul logan paul still relaventthey deserve nooooo money game game like ordering meal ending starter consisting salad leaf colorful game ok doesnt feel like previous wolfenstein games like game pretty badbarebones repetitive completely lacking made old blood new order great mention buggy play borderlands youll get better version fun times since coop game pretty fun game repetitive af fun nonetheless shooting sharp ever game seriously flawed needs way save games play hour get killed go back whole hourmore checkpoints maybecant recommend game shit make like wolfenstein ii burn ground game trash lol cant even single thing work coop tried mins succesi dont recommend game sooo underrated even better predecessors great rights really dont understand whining leveling system new enemy armorhealth bar system imo add welcome depth complexity still plenty easy rip hordes baddies gory abandon ive big wolfenstein head since kid cutting teeth original wolfenstein fpss spear destiny etc installment tops far really hope initial griping doesnt cause devs abandon progress theyve made game still great different wolfenstein games recommend play medium easy difficulty game harder previous games game unfortunately far removed superb previous entries machinegames bad game looks good potential good gameplay much muddled myriad factors reviews summed nicely better could short bullet points awaits youngblood coop focus even solo play play alongside ai companion pretty useless breaks stealth makes bossfights harder drawing fire getting killed revive companion otherwise start share lives small maps visit lot ton quite frankly boring side missions send back lot quickly becomes tedious even fight enemies side missions necessary game levelling system areas story missions need higher level also random side objectives also basic get repetitive soon exact one pop twice within minutes area feel like give perk points powerups etc thanks structure also respawning enemies bulletsponges btw specific armor effectively shot specific weaponry pausing manual saving checkpoints storyboss missions wipe boss youll restart whole level much reduced interaction character less focus story weak story overall many interesting characters begin main characters horrible people say banter pretty bad microtransactions course wouldnt modern video game withoutit really sad machinegames arkane venerable studios somehow managed deliver poor product far cry youd expect want wolfenstein title id recommend avoid one maybe try change things later date dont think possible turn one around without going deep core game systems structure story simply hope next entry series return singleplayer focused linear fps vein new order old blood note new collossus like game already mission structure hinted one areas could revisit sideops found boring already game unlike wolfenstein games essentially another far cry new dawn level enemies levels shields gradually harder get lesser known aspect weapons game affect different shields pairing smartly take whatever enemy ahead cool aspect enemies bullet sponges im co op person love experience games pace first thought id forced co op game thankfully thought ai partner allow go solo part shes alright get fucking last boss ai follows around much leads explosives runs boss dies lives left forcing risk save restart mention first phase boss need target back since fucking ai follows faces entire time needs way control ai smarter seriously enjoying aspects leveling getting skills upgrading guns really fun progression think would really work given aspects improve level requirements raid missions actually got excited side quests level fairly quickly however even though finish game less hours levels extremely repetitive going back areas time time againspeaking levels repetitive even mention theyre insanely confusing times markers strange without map view whole level extremely confusing lastly story enjoy little besides super short premise finding bj got keen twist midway huge revelation got keen games villian built well hardly even care final thought aswell characters built games arent max set even ferguswyatt idea feels like small game really keen play missing everything wolfenstein games built game fun quite lot issuesi enjoy able freely explore world many little details like bethesda games large issues almost made quit someone playing game couldnt use metro system spent minutes trying find way actually continue playing issues include communication ive played game one guy good mic fun play rest afk didnt work blatantly horrible play screeching mic ruining game needs report system implementedother game doesnt really explain lot things crashy bethesda game regardless fairly horrible online experience ludicrous addition believe fun game ive quite enjoyed playing faredit another horrible experience would like add would brother raid contains spoilers spoiler fighting way underground system made way brother unlock weapon essentially shoots electricity open doors group damage building tried everything could get locked room white doors locked appeared way inside friend playing decided waste time would try later fought way back raid go back beginning realise unlike missions couldnt exit come back later finish last attempt get noticed covered vent collapsed bridge platform finally got weapon spoiler im sure within month two guides released people get stuck stuff like seems every bethesda game stupid moments like positive side ive enjoyed playing game change fairly point point b story mode type game open world rpg bold move welcome changeanother thing want point never spend money gold pay win bs within hours youll every gun unlocked upgraded pretty highly least half abilities game fun checkpoints game stupid something takes hours die quickly find way back start annoying game way hard play even easiest mode enemies still bulletsponges slowly heal inflict enough damage certain enemies like supersoldiers never issues like playing wolfenstein games wolfenstein games played one fun game needs drop price seems sweet spot developer wants recoup development income spent promising game fell short couldve game runs stable fps second highest setting using ti many games graphics achieve im giving thumb game clearly made machine games instead entirely arkanes fault theyre fine studio idea make game like shows grindy repetitive looter shooter forced coop shallow short ultimately unsatisfying story awful writing everyone talking theyre kidding course gunplay graphics topnotch theyre brought wolf ii thats compliments game gets unless youre wolfenstein superfan avoid one wait third installment main series hopefully machine games project game great beat base game friend thats far game way better actually expected good rpg stuff quite bit quests story could used work though bugs nothing game breaking game highly anticipated everyone ever played one wolfenstein games wolfenstein youngblood much potential even really good franchise really good developers make oopsie friend finished game together sure intense wasnt exciting thought disgustingly difficult dont know machinegames bethesda thinking general failure wolfenstein game honestly game panned critics lot players fan recent machinegames wolfenstein games knew wanted give try judge tldr terrible moderately fun coop pretty repetitive mediocre story elaborate bit initially really didnt mind addition rpg elements initial impression positively adding complexity would otherwise mindless shooter opinion sort changed course first couple hours honestly didnt really mind upgrades sisters progressively gaining health armor pretty basic premise really didnt care gun upgrades call upgrades opinion less would applied upgrades would enjoyed upgrading guns linear fashion make progressively powerful thats guns work youngblood gun different parts made different vendors different tradeoffs game didnt find time comparing stats different parts vendors enjoyable didnt go youngblood prepared rpgmindset felt cumbersome understand goal probably provide player choice ended picking couple upgrades spent rest game ignoring frequent upgrades available notification offensive aspect youngblood though quests gone linear chapterbased progression previous wolfenstein games youngblood yet another attempt bethesda create liveservice game main quests side quests pretty indiscernible one another main quest requires breach three large fortresses side quests given afterthefact require revisit three areas theres real meaningful dialogue story whatever macguffin side quest uses justify existence theres pretty much unlimited number procedurally generated quests game literally ends message says abby always new queststhe sistersyeah theyre pretty cringey mean theyre like game overly edgy maybe theyre relatable likable someone age group personally found bit immature combine quest design limited number recorded remarks sisters say combat yeah found little bit annoying hearing youre slayin jess timesthe best scene game spoiler undoubtedly finding bj honestly kind crazy considering origins wolfenstein series likeable machinegames made bj since taking reins unfortunately bjs time onscreen youngblood short spoilerthis another one games really wish steam neutral option fun playing coop friend yeah would ever recommend playing solo absolutely game quite fun friend mine understand negative reviews personally enjoyed game good even free get game unplayable solo better someone else want go hell repeat game unplayable solo game make fallout like good game stay away game warning stay away game would awesome crash updated video drivers worked fine crashed went play said error wanted start game love wolfenstien played hours want begin way instalment departs linear journey game seen previous instalments works like freedom open world approach plan encounters run away others youre levelled youd rather focused plot driven experience might want think twice one ties customisation options look pretty good far might frustrate youd rather get brings point game political statement really really isnt unless thought shooting nazis offends theres one kind person feels like go guess new order old blood new colossus feels like entirely different game wolfenstein skin weapons arent impactful dont feel heavy fire like im shooting rock wall hit enemies gun play one best parts games combat feels hollow like might well knife every enemy alsowhere hell pause button gotta get coffee take poo feed cats gotta hope run back level far enough dont get killed god sake kind game doesnt pause button story within first minutes felt disjointed scattered kinda cookie cutter get game feel like im racing get currency unlock things didnt feel like trying find happening charactersat ive waiting game nearly year suppose expectations high wolfenstein reviews stated looter shooter big shallow oceanthe hours game play everything else inch deepmaybe played might change mind though im refunding sale happens complete different take rest modern wolfenstein games taken bad one gameplay follows rpg turn levels actually dont end mattering world levels gain abilities make much capable along way movement really excelled games game continues trend sure setup coop solo able beat normal take found enough coins everything wanted buy microtransactions werent problem basically liked hope go back pure fps wolfenstein decent game right price gameplay game straight forward simple interesting plot follow played hours game truly enjoy open world aspect game brings table game blend interesting elements dishonored prey notably player

play friends love playing ai teammate opposed single player world gorgeous incredibly creative humor better hated seriousness last wolfenstein game cmon nazis moon game taken seriously greater variety enemies makes fun firefights overall far ok fps game wolfenstein window dressing none excellent narrativestory weve come expect modern wolfenstein fact theres barely story blaskovics daughters save nazis thats basically whole story isnt horrible fps far fun choices got sale got full price hard pass small sidegame play friend third part trilogy dont go thinking going like new order new colossus regarding scope storyor even parts gameplay like new rpg system enemies bulletsponges like arcady fast goofy shooter main characters seem based beavis butthead something light enjoy waiting third installment price right recommended solid continuation wolfenstein storyline coop aspect adds new challenge gameplay game length reflected price dont doubt people plenty fun multiplayer side fence controls similar previous iterations game added difficulties longer remove turrets use heavy weapons though pick heavy weapons store inventory associated skill moving covertly level far difficult especially considering coop weapon powerups driven collected cash upgraded time tailored playing style dont provide much advantage combatthe biggest change playing style game leveling aspect kills discoveries missions generate xp levels character increasing overall damage providing skill points player spend additional combat advantage biggest drawback needing pay close attention attacking possible wander areas city enemy levels far especially initially cant win specific area helps leave try somewhere else powered enough come back real damage actually functions well mechanic reduces overall linear feel story spite significantly smaller playing area past games sum cheap fun game enjoy friends brings history wolfenstein games table adding new mechanics enhance playability smaller game sweet game terrible game tries balancing coop singleplayer manages wrong places couldnt finish watched cinematic movie cutscenes youtube movie clearly understood dare say good sisters quirky bj blazkowicz cool happened grace unexpected point game story tie cutscenes everything explained cutscenesif movie would good nice feeling anticipation upcoming games game terrible makes us wish something like never happen hope next gamehopefully prequel bj protagonist better least equal previous games conditional recommendation get deep discount dont care story characters games gunplay pretty decent two guns satisfying shoot pretty good level design allowing multiple approaches verticality aesthetics spot imagine dystopian nazi controlled paris look many performance issues bugs vary rarely would get light stutter nothing major crashes cool boss fights deep upgrade tree reasonably well designed decent stealth option submachinegun shotgun trash even full upgrades feel damage output twins hilariously bad characters huge favour skip every single cutscene story general garbagetier massive grind going achievements recommend farming first level stealth cash quickest way get weapon upgrades coop option subpar hardly anyone playing different take wolfenstein style gameplay title adds great deal depth character customization leveling perks lot consider using ai since must always play two players game lot fun times great deal challenge recommend wolfenstein player avid series fun game play dollars cant beat coop works great game looks great rarely see bug game would recommend game anyone someone play good several weekends gaming hours still lots collectibles side missions complete would buy choose well made coop shooter light rpg elements want kill nazis together friend wont go wrong buying game havent played singleplayer cant speak aspectthe story adequate far im seven hours many side missions basic premise bj blazkowicz hero previous wolfenstein games mysteriously

carrying capacity etc complete arbitrary tasks time using specific weapons didnt want grind kills turret get extra armor get skill points leveling completing certain story missions get choose upgrade get use guns want without specifically use guns dont typically use upgrade paths weapons like dont like used find weapon upgrade collectible items didnt find didnt upgrade weapons three paths upgrades various pieces scope stock handle magazine etc problem part gun costs silver eventually get guns upgrading every piece every gun pricey unlocking three paths even pricey level ability improve upgrade chose effective isnt lot money youre running around chests enemies drop youre constantly running around picking money meant grind time consuming want try different upgrade routes test different play styles isnt enough money laying around weapons also increase damage get kills like favorite guns become even better basically run around rifle shotgun super effective promote lack money laying around daily weekly quests complete money bonus experience another way adding filler game im fan dont like idea daily weekly quests way allow player get money max weapons weapons upgrades could cheaper

disaster end game ridiculous super hard sophie keeps dying time disaster first saw trailer wolfenstein youngblood thought would terrible level design new colossus mixed two annoying young lead protagonists wrongyoungblood far perfect arkane developers dishonored series created similar open level layout dishonored world design superb packed detail filled clutter easter eggs gorgeous scenery bombed cities mixed heavily mechanized alternate aesthetic really immerses player like dishonored reminds half life soundtrack also amazingmix machine games stunning weapon combat slightly grindy fun leveling system actually forces side missions tackle tougher enemies especially later game two girls also likeable hilarious times especially game blast nazis head clean laugh cheer xdtechnically updated id tech engine stunning well optimized compared new colossus mid lower end systems runs smoothly even test best systems especially ultra uber settings using game currency level big change previous wolfenstein games though game microtransactions theres plenty money game already max everything turn nazi slaying wrecking ball thankfully making purchase microtransactions pointlessthe game played offline singleplayer bot without needing create bethesda account unfortunately play friend online required create account must link steam account hope remove requirement future nearly turned game keep lot players awaythere small issues playing alone ai sister nothing game breaking bit slow revive final boss pretty tough playing ive completed game theres good hours game time sides missions cant go wrong hopefully wolfenstein iii similar design though im fan online coopif fan wolfenstein dishonored get game first came excited found didnt play wellafter coming back finally awesome im super happy made coop wolfenstein game ability weapon upgrades visuals excellent plays nice smooth unlike lot little details ive noticed appreciatethe weird thing hold crouch option toggle crouch forgivable considering everything else seems finealso story feels little aimless far theres enough far maybe itll get better writing hours playedfor game totaly worth friend play withbig bonus friend dosent need buy game invite everything full gamethis feels like weird wolfenstein borderlands crossover borderlands gameplay wolfenstein universebut love good enough opening elevator door animations require players itjust make doors open automatically players need press button goits fine first times gets really annoying get enjoyment game playing co op feel many issues give positive review would neutral possible lower price certainly works games favour co op essential cannot imagine trying solo ai team mate start everything fine game quickly descended grindy mess within hours even normal rank file enemies take shots face fully upgraded shotgun enemies randomly respawn every area bet half game going back areas complete mind numbing side quests developers wanted make similar borderlands level upgrades powers ruined point game like wolfenstein doom got right twins also incredibly annoying well one constantly acting like bro saying dude every seconds fun enough game fill time till big co op games release id avoid till patches line probably pay preferably good previous entries wolfenstein youngblood still overall enjoyable youll want friends play ai often incompetent issues ive run several times clipping floor checkpoints need reworked youll spend lots time replaying long areas youve already done dialogue voice acting average best connection issues frequent could dont best internet visually game impressive combat mostly improved previous installments though level system feel place makes hard anything running gunning perk system weapon modifications good addition would recommend game wait sale deluxe edition worth buddy pass best wolfenstein games near bad people say played totally solo ai completely competent even play stealth except one time game short dont like upgraderpg mechanics arnt going like however fine game fast paced full fun wolfenstein action using skills upgraded weapons experience bullet sponge people talked play normaloverall good game better thought would complaints expected definitely suffering network issues game offers really solid fun coop shooter experience difficulty feels good customizations quite deep whole plethora weapons choose overall game good certain cases extremely masochistic believe became trend last games suffer indefinitely hope time might cases ruin whole game experience game somwhat repetitive multiple issues portrayal blazkowicz twins game provided decent coop experiencewould recommend deep sale purchase friend mind play since ai companion really drag higher difficulties game traditional wolfenstein game bothersome shield mechanics involving different types ammo generally enjoy game thus far combat fluid general worth someone play people find lead characters awkward times humor believe tries capitalize slightly vibe appreciate humor part well see traditionalist would mad annoying changes enjoy game nazi elevators except select one button visit two floors surveillance cams elevators running battery technology cant make elevator doors open aside like game includes lot history previous games references games includes many weapons panzerhunds gotten really slow compared new order nazis easy kill upgraded weapons laserkraftwerk kill first shotmy best advice dont go siegturm plaza least level higher beating lothar anything lower difficult getting achievements sucks boring keep thing even going achievements make sure talk abby people catacombs get side missions main missions greatly reduces replay levels find good game play dont want commit getting indepth game sometimes like shooting nazis wolfenhonored diswolfen called game dishonored mixed wolfenstein sounds good check game also tacked leveling system pointless silly dialogue still enjoyed game good first machine games wolfenstein course really offensive either hopefully get traditional fps game machine gamesoh guess microtransactions never saw cant say anything wolfenstein youngblood fun smooth gameplay great graphics especially rtx overall really fun gaming experienceits downsides rather short story limited map variety though enjoyed maps lot easier navigate compared wolfenstein ii new colossus certain enemies take quite lot hits gets highlighted games leveling system mostly affects damage levels available upgradesthe ai companion worked really well playthrough real issues whatsoever though ai character didnt really add experience either probably alot fun human player insteadstill games definitely worth picking sale enjoy fps titles heavily focus gameplay wolfenstein youngblood international version playing several hours designed well makes fun play saving button missing great game big fun continue way wolfenstein youngblood departure wolfenstein games past game much rpg done style division played wolfenstein game things like familiar like armor suits heavy weapons characters story totally new different wolfenstein game featuring bj blazkowicz plenty nazis kill

friend isnt guess thats refunding game buying wolfenstein coop fun newlyintroduced lightrpg mechanics add nice new layer typical wolfenstein game really enjoyable least one friend play tried single player ai would anyone play game strictly advertised coop experience beyond gunplay amazing expected wolfenstein game environments better ever plenty upgrades guns offer different approaches use writing dialogue par could experience previous titles well havent completed whole campaign yet unable fully judge tho part didnt like underground forces use flashlight premium currency allows buy cosmetic itemsall definitely worth price enjoyed previous wolfenstein games looking similar experience friend theres also option replay main missions different difficulties well plenty unlockables

going forward wolfenstein hope devs take reviews feedback heart get back track would recommend game like rest machinegames goes forward point play confused wolfenstein comes wolfenstein youngblood pseudoopenworld kindof rpg sortof story driven game published bethesda made arkane studios description game sounds weird thats game weird wolfenstein youngblood sequel new colossus follows bjs daughters honestly couldnt tell either names couldnt care less boring uninteresting say someone isnt huge fan bj first two games hes sterotypical machoman interesting traits note least bj memorable

wolfenstein game eu watch youtube worth thing game level design worst game ive ever played gonna wolfenstein franchise like never buy dogshit game worst new wolfensteins games weak story bulletspongy

development interaction two sisters abby play game nothing near level quality intro new order new colossus might bit heavy cutscenes one seriously underperforminggraphics sound game really good much

individuallythe guns aint upgradable items time level goes levels youll get damage increase skill point upgrade sister youve chosen enemies go level around way even get stronger enemies try keep youi conclude game enough offer price tag recommend playing together someone lost focus playing alone since isnt much story going keep busy quickly running gunning someone else distracting might make fun

castle wolfentein yet loved wolfenstein years come skipped generation got rebooted picked new order solid shooter one best genre new colossus kinda divided fans must admit still solid shooter likable characters story graphics gameplay fluid level design chore much oldblood also good standard game didnt bring much oh damn youngblood chore nowhere fun kinda stucked refunding keep playing finish one damn day never ever remember id ever finish game ill make sure updating review probably remain negative though game bad honestly mediocre average hybrid shooter maybe subpar game remember fucking wolfenstein seemingly tried bring something new shouldnt supposed like rpg elements dont go well wolfenstein new colossus didnt shake much loved game chore dont want keep repeating please remember game choreenemies bullet sponge bet would heard like times already yeah thats truth immortal nowhere hard point level played mins sister ai dumb find playing gunblazing mode stealth kinda unbearable still hard get used enemies fucking health bars outleveled fuck great cant even enjoy instance bosses dangerous creatures game like even first boss made want quit leave lmao still managaeble long

nope hunt coins wolfenstein game since enemies bullet sponge based levels logical fill map bunch enemies fucking shared lives sister revive miliseconds good thing obviously cant revive fast go gunblaze style thing await good gangbang though havent restarted level bc still playing game fear damages experience one damned thing hub bunch missions set certain levels like fuck also learned finished main mission go catacombs via menu hard way ive played map minutes completed bunch stupid side objectives thought nope didnt grinding crushing game bc main chars love female protagonists also swearing everyone personally loved games like wolfenstein dishonored deus ex md south park fractured whole reviewed mixed problems quite enjoyable shit feel really sorry stuff optimization issue oddly cutscenes locked fps looks worse ingame ingame graphics similar new colossus mean course get fps uber graphs via main characters likeable dont really think wont bj bj quite deep character fps game

youngblood kind multiplaying expansion new colossus somethings youll feel uncomfortable mostly related multiplay oriented changeswhy play solo conclude thiss fall wolfenstein seriesybs even wolfenstein iii nearly based new colossus im playing game solo coop didnt go smoothly first glace feel completely ok random matching highly recommend youre truly fan new colossus new orderand ever dreamed playing games friends must try game youngblood mix machine games arkane studios known single player experiences different approach storytelling view speculation choices makes game likely appeal spoiler everyonemachine games known new series wolfenstein true fans heritage old blood love letter fans return castle wolfenstein possibly favourite franchise machine games focused cutscenes bring characters life interesting internal monologues scripted levels allow diverse approach stealth going loud proud hub inbetween missions allow character growth player interaction side charactersarkane hand known dishonoured series approaching story telling different direction like sandboxes giving player tools explore experience story part eyes players chosen protagonist missions separated hub side missions accepted next story mission sandbox usually missed cannot go backthe similarities established machine game formula dishonoured arkane recipe choice approach stealth manage worlds lore character players character growth motivations youngblood built two different foundations similar drives wolfenstein fan machine games indeed past entries open sandbox clashing past well crafted mazes puzzles used however think enjoyed wolfenstein raven software know one games time likes forget yet enjoyed one think youngblood appeal search chase objectives paris time rather isenstadton paper freedom explore sounds great practice expected wolfenstein franchise clever crafted labyrinths secrets find hand feels like poor level design however poorly implemented different approach fails due lack player motivation care environment dishonored every side mission main mission impact hub world grows making choice missions rewarding wolfenstein youngblood seems samey enemies respawn place npcs tell good happening efforts besides lifeless ones hub catacombs streets never really change get side missions alternative ways start raids brother towers many side missions poorly labelled ui choose active whats near inevitably go back hub catacombs sent wolfenstein youngblood takes new approach gameplay well ingesting rpg elements requiring player take note previous wolfenstein games series perks awarded chosen playstyle achieving challenges almost naturally abilities unlock skill points earn levelling certain missions abilities split three sections mind muscle power mind focus health recovery exploration muscle armour dual wielding heavy weapon options power three choices one locked till later ram cloak allowing improved bonuses either run gun stealth play stylesthis allows new protagonists novices feel different dad dual wielding pistols heavy weapons makes girls feel somewhat behind bj strength however sisters carry heavy weapons right ability choices making e question bj always threw away yes level gating thing includes choice abilities sections map enemy always high level rather scaling deter rushing main story missions grind feel awful quite quick level side missions dont feel rewarding progressing story makes feel needless padding interesting think concession allow coop drop partners never feel behind story guns also take advantage new rpg side things weapon mastery boosts damage getting many kills upgrades guns section choice parts different brands three brand gain brand bonus parts give extra tools torch dark areas rifle torch stops dual wielding limits pistol weapon top gun ammo every ammo bonus one two different armour types hollow squares tall rectangles want one favour different armour types swap easily combat mix match

best weapon job find ignore upgrades mastery scaling struggle use wrong ammo keep mind melt either quite reasonably starting choice effects starting weapons sister unlocked upgrade alreadyyou get rest enough money upgrades tutorial mission making almost mute mention sisters handle play missed opportunity personally give freedom players choose customise sisters play style eventually jack trades double jump begin making game vertical interesting main selling point coop fun partner ai many bugs difficulties medium hindrance rather help coop features like double locks awkward code reading forced keep guys together best thing staying close though emotes yes said emotes actually things boosting armour health full revives partner make nice addition allow get quirky silliness sisters max three lives share dont bleed help otherwise life lost reloads area loose ammo checkpoint originally making increasingly harder emotes great keep eye one equipped time set partner benefit one anotherthe story story play story play gun playthis poor wolfenstein game story level design two factors machine games known making lot negative feeling towards game valid however fun dumb shooter light rpg elements enjoy buddy wolfenstein universe machine games created microtransactions exist game shouldnt hereso overall youngblood standalone expansion like tob except far experimental theres coop leveling hubs sidemissions much greater emphasis replayability played game solo enjoyed coop isnt mandatory leveling controversial mostly nonissue quickly hubs fun explore reminded bit dishonored sidemissions pretty halfassed theres lot gaas stuff like daily weekly challenges story character development minimal writing definitely less poignant last gamesnone stuff really matters though core gameplay rock solid addition doublejump gives far mobility previous games new wonderfully op weapons kill really fun run around kill stuff everything else icing cake said couple things didnt like dualwielding restricted onehanded weapons making far less satisfying addition secondary firing modes gone means dualwielded rocket launchers flak cannons annoyed lot first started playing got pretty quicklyultimately enjoyment youngblood depends priorities enjoy previous games surprisingly good writing cinematic moments wont like youngblood enjoy previous games gameplay like youngblood youngblood fantastic originally bought game love franchise wanted something new play borderlands released next month idea would good ive played solo far blast youngblood like metroid wolfenstein perfectly playable solo fairly challenging interesting story previous weapons back available use well unique abilities perks based suits eight hours done lot side missions one larger main missions estimate game could around hours gameplay depending much like whether go online completiondespite hyperbolic people plays decent loop would compare gunplay destiny borderlands leveling matters far people hit wall completely ignore side objectives try mainline story runs fairly well mid high settings gf megs ram processor youngblood different typical wolfenstein game could see acquired taste fun like rpg style shooters like borderlands youngblood isnt like tno tob tnc coop focused game thatll going back levels complete different missions dont go expecting like others thats say completely differentthe overall gunplay gameplay feel much like games visuals like nicer rtx soundtrack still great theres also decent story cutscenes similar quality main real difference progression replay levels multiple times different objectives order level game definitely made youll reply things need earn silver unlock level parts weapons far feels like youll need grind want unlock everythingoverall still great wolfenstein game highly recommend playing friend im sure theyve changed since launch game isnt grindfest thought would enemies much bullet sponge expecting either although entire experience coop faralso youre weary characters like reviews dont theyre perfectly fine likeable albeit little cheesy expect dont take away game youngblood takes winning mechanics previous game throws window replaces

game thats supposed entire nazi regime kills disappointing selecting weapon wheel time isnt slowed paused something become pretty much standard fps games yet youngblood doesnt feature instead get head blown youre scrolling weapon wheel searching gun ammo lean corner look game cant customize keys wanna make leaning qe like pretty much fps games nope picking ammo consumes entire stack lets say gun missing ammo theres entire crate ammo ground pick entire crate consumed gain ammo thats grenades throwables dont gain weapon mastery youre literally losing mastery guns time decide throw multiple

anymore media matterjust gonna say runs great solid bug yethas funny characters great gameplaygreat voice acting weapons know loveat dollars alot bang buck blast good previous wolfenstein games still enjoyable good game terrible far good previous versions though guns fine gameplay bad story nowhere found characters annoying fistbumping teens look like pair lefty teen lesbyfriends given new toys let imagination run wild compared others game shockingly bad expecting instead got game given nothing yet taken soul buy peril fun worth okay first let start thisthis game bad said watch gameplay see getting everything everyone complaining freaking gameplay footage said bugs issues loading times bit long problems game fun friend cant speak solo play since dont play solo microtransactions optional effect nothing maybe grinding wit said recommend friend play one cleanest mechanics fps ever quality game really fun coop experience friend played minutes expected hoping wolfeinstein co op dont care health bars leveling rpg elements probably bad game definitely wanted optional microtransactions ingame money get easily like dmc fps skill tree lvl system almost like borderlandsweapons mastery weapon mods upgrades weapon skinsoptional side quests semi open world coop specially buddy passi give game satisfied happy deluxe preorder months ago please love god change way damn game saves ive mission three days three days game refuses competent autosave system makes game unfun pretty fun like killin nazis pretty good pretty good sale pretty gud quite fun friend dont believe much fun solo really good game friends solo repetitive map enemies tough fuk final boss ridiculously hard recommended kind player buy play rly fun game good mate definitely worth aud deluxe edition probably worth people spending aud either could pay usd aud tops would easy recommend safe mode way go seems like solo campaign multi playeralso seems like written year old girls script panders young feel alienated hard believe storyline shedloads fun mate short compared others good story though far loving playing co op buddy many changes great change gameplay doesnt fun enemy hard killyou must focus single target many timedont like health bar level staffs makes game unreal btw server sucks lag time plot wise game meh mostly run gun would like say would probably fun coop modemore min actual combat fun sisters amusing commentary honesty highlights game sadly isnt muchas big problem game got copy friend well copy seems work alright ive played coop times buggy workablemy friends copy immediatly crashes upon opening making impossible us play together research supposedly due dated graphics drivers updated themno go tried running admin go etc etcto point return game without even getting try tldr honestly cant good faith suggest getting game buggy may even open could id return solid coop fpsrpg solid gunplay well optimized nice rpg elements nice super awesome game good play friends sadly servers arent great alot lag game says tinif want play solo even let downa game playable friend random stranger online dont look cannot play friends search whatever forum like bethesda want fun friends game another example much bethesda hates fan games reminder much fucking hate game fun beatiful great thinking play game way advertized fucking shock game fun points even price point needs dollars less release support features game sold game self fun get work worked hours shit level sudden getting constant freezes stuttering unplayable point couldnt even quit launch task manager even close would recommend getting might pick back months gotta refund game fun farm mission total silver coins half playtime gunplay awesome graphics amazing rpg element nice change pace think people upset fact story driven like first ones people need realize spin offered cheap begin nice trade still recommend getting sale youll way fun friend decent sized community youll get random matches fairly often good long dont expect dollar game wolfenstein game wish never played strength wolfenstein reboot franchise features two greatest releases recent fps history lies combination snappy writing compelling world character design exceptional gunplay stealth mechanics game unfortunately none qualities writing cute times passable shooter game although sisters dialogues belong life strange game wolfenstein game never introspective exciting two mainline entries series absence lovetohate antagonists particularly noticeable story largely nonexistent premise find dadenemy weapon designs mostly recycled previous game little innovation despite game taking place nearly years new colossus even though take place historic paris games levels snoozers without even half personality tnos europe tncs americagameplaywise game attempted adopt certain mechanics looter shooter genre turning every enemy bullet sponge visible health bar peppering levels inane collectibles currencies character even levels rack body count granting mostly useless upgrades abilities fails two reasons transcendent gunplay stealth first two games completely negated instance headshots longer kill nazis one bullet every attempt stealthily clearing area immediately turn firefight barely satisfying win another example previous games could play tactically instance shooting enemies legs disable crucial seconds deal pressing target game simply shoot things health bar reaches zero loot game looter shooter without loot enemies drop aforementioned currencies use marginally upgrade guns mystifyingly game also microtransactions letting pay real money acquire gold bars use buy skins characters guns wholly unnecessary game playing one person games saving grace coop add layer fun largely notfun game team friend one could argue however game multiplayer fun play friends matter shitty wolfenstein youngblood failed experiment disregards everything makes previous games franchise great trying wolfenstein destiny time ignoring best parts games implementing worst even possible make killing nazis fun wouldnt recommend anyone unless wolfenstein head get sale less game bit departure wolfenstein formula really dont think thats bad thing spinoff fun game fun bugs im enjoying shooting amazing played beat game really fun game would fun wernt required revive ai sister goes every seconds boss fight fun game enjoy part agree criticism game got though dialog corny uninteresting left levels feel mission design uninspired look past issues game enjoyable play runs great machine honestly fun playing much better hope isnt sign things come series really enjoyed wolfenstein sad see heading wrong path go back single player focus good storys think wanted anything wolfenstein could happy adding weapons different armor types game game really little anything add anything positive series id still recommend weapon mechanics good like fps games enjoy wolfenstein game dont know bethesda publisher pushing studios take really successful franchise change game play bull reason change game play push micro transactions another fallout one like play fallout still fallout game way doesnt feel like wolfenstein game like old games bit open still good run gun style nazi killing game isnt funin fact didnt even want play game really wanted play game first two enjoyable system mission doesnt seem neccessary feel like shouldve able get skins playing missions instead earning money tldr game little hard write review ultimately shooting good makes recommend multiple technical levels fails want get wait salethe coop matchmaking completely random level matched level due leveling system weapons near useless ai teammate get playing okay firefight mostly bullet sponge frequently bugs hangs back doesnt try revive get knocked downstory ok protagonists didnt really bother much people guesslevelingrpg system largely unnecessarythere difficulty spike early largely due heavily armored enemies continue playing get weapons abilities counter armor frustrating thenlevel design quest hub several fairly open areas pretty good arkane also dishonored much styleshooting still weighty engaging tons nazis shitting game pretty obvious whyanyways theres lack multiplayercoop features manage find active player really fun many distractions shooting storynot fan ai coop gameplayenemies bullet spongesnot sure changed gameplay mechanics much aint broke dont fix itthis feels like game new dev team feels totally different previous wolfenstein games top nici nu l instalat dar e top uncomfortable game designweird
