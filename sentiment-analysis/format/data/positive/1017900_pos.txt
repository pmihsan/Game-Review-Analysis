campaigns im still fairly disappointed unless money spare absolutely buy hd instead game cannot really speak nostalgic never played one kid maybe youd love graphical overhaul rts released gameplay changes minimal might explain lot complaints slow pace questionable pathfinding someone regularly enjoys experiencing revisiting older sometimes much older games point first secondgeneration realtime strategy games used like try playing original warcraft dosbox example personally love experienced fps problems people far anyways im hrs like steady pace game playing tutorial campaign huge nostalgia high would recommend anyone played aoe back day experience series whole age empire ii hd though prepared adapt charmingyetoutdated rts mechanics great remake aoe fun play brings back lot memoriesits unfortunate much bugs left unfixed game remember settings campaing progress stored cloud game issues high dpi displays ui redesigned sexy classic aoe great update remains faithful original weird formula hasnt needed much updating reskin twenty two year old game minor issues pathfinding things expect sit back enjoy nostalgia superb game highly recommended good game im glad steam brought back

autosave whole game feels like year old game great years ago awesome like awesome last years basically age empires grew except prettier qol improvements dont expect different game loved original love one hated original well arent going like much better original small feat faithful original perhaps faithful pace game glacial somehow despite revamp glaring problems weird pathing issues victory conditions sometimes bit janky slow menus long loadtimes fun nice qol adjustments fun rts good aoede better p honestly good aoe whole franchise matter engine unpolished encountering many minor hiccups constantly games many gameplay elements intuitive great original version improvements like remember plus better graphics old cheats work sort thing like playing age empires back day complete cosmetic overhaul would hoped would fixed terrible ai pathfinding added ability zoom overall good first came really really fun like getting back closest possible time travelling like playing classic improved

bad game dated like go get perfect pretty much original game one greatest rts games ever made said later games improved upon formula first game still good time really tough know make game nothing else definitive edition certainly true original point fault updated visuals impressive certain qualityoflife features like handy tooltips remind new veteran players alike buildings house upgrades welcome additionshowever feel quite strongly window dressing wasnt thing requiring update one major reasons hailed best series due large part wide variety strategic unit options available guiding fielding armies unit tactics put play definitive edition strikes something bizarre frustrating even seasoned player original imagine many newer players likely resort cheat codes clear campaign missions alltoofaithful retention games original ai cause units pathfind incorrectly around terrain features clump pause attacking target retreating losing units potentially entire missions ones inexperience incompetence rts player one thing likewise antiquated ai entirely anotherthats difficult recommend title stands one hand accustomed kind jank sort game back early nearly thirty years removed kinds software limitations acceptable ai pathfinding versatility unit tactics brought spec wouldnt issue heralding iteration worthy update original given game plays archaic fashion despite modern appearance surely drive away newer players players accustomed even cannot good faith recommend purchase anyone save diehard aoe fans regarded classic reason may ai modern games pathfinding bit dodgy battles end brawls matter choose deploy troops huge amounts fun upgrades make game compatible modern computers widescreen monitors work well played game lot early noughties still find enjoyable well challenging times better games want historical accuracy andor clever tactical warfare provide pleasure game id played dadvery nice remake way play old man expect throwback first aoe clean look everything else

standard qualityoflife improvements theyve made make difference issue think one needed remake remaster lot let fly original isnt acceptable title produced twenty years later theres lot horrible broken balancing game silly little things like unable build gates walls youve built updating visuals audio crowd pleaser sure doesnt change fact age empires isnt good rts isnttldr youre popping old age empires cds youre buying new release dont think modernised enough really warrant plays exactly like originalfor better worse came expecting modern age game original setting youll disappointed came nostalgia youll happy resultmostly graphics excellent assets keep true original looking sharp detailed small things like roman scutum leaning wall barracks make models pop certain oddities original still remain however tiered hills well cheat units didnt receive facelift others dont expect hd version zug music also updated use actual instruments instead digital mixed result songs sound amazing end feeling wrong place fortunately playing custom game choose use classic graphics also uses classic sound effects music however remains updated version finally cinematicsand opening cinematic replaced something incredibly uninspired serves reminder ensemble wasnt involved overall though still enjoyable experience veteran player go back revisit began youre new havent experienced age series yet id wait age definitive edition november plays like original updated graphics plays similar original back graphics sound great upgrades pretty much game started tho units idiots cant make formations get around also far deadlier remember troops get quite bit done please play game good learn history poor pathfinding unrealistic ai game looks nice enough runs smoothly really gave nostalgia feelsthat said pathfinding units poor individual units move ok try move group forget itin addition ai ridiculously difficult mentioned reviews also dont like pop limit campaign missions wouldnt really recommend unless dirt cheap isnt worth pour faire simple cest une madeleine de proust qui la saveur avec un plus bel emballage un vrai remake fait par des pour des jeu est super beau mais souffre des que le jeu dorigine ce qui peut perturbant si est aux rts modernesun bon petit voyage dans le temps la campagne aux parties multijoueurs cependant sauf si vous voulez vous replonger dans les pretty cool come back long time aoe still awesome honest aoe ii fixed lots issues aoe pretty fun game overall desync issues multilplayer drags pretty much remember og game adding auto reseeding good addition though previously purchased refunded ago decided give another try fall saleactually really appreciate updated graphics nice attention detail especially zoomed inmusic tracks good path finding far needs lot work units wonder constantly brought back gamehope fixed probably drastic effective aoe upgrade three pros good old know lovecons exactly good old know love let explain furtherwhile de name says keeps many things made aoe better resource trading system unless gold gold trading shipspath finding exactly bad original tech costs rebalanced still need gold upgrade gold

hud know many villagers used resource even actually working wich confusing wasnt idle villager maniac always using idle villager button new feature tho rise romenow lets talk biggest contention point campaignas said pop limit still adding brain dead ai difficulties also reworked maps easier good way first babylon map holy man still nightmare even got resources hunt campaign possibly hardest original game cakewalk reason forgotten empires nerfed skirmish levels skirmish levels levels start limited set units find trough level cant build replenish troops hunt mother skirmish levels unforgiving requires good use troops specially priestswhat give villagers lots resources gather since ai set defensive waiting next move like original level dont worry attacked dont even worry accidentally killing villagers later find kind situation repeats every map used limited resources maps actually made new map instead actually harder ones used skirmishes cakewalkthe yamato campaign worst original rushed difficulty place fe good job getting rid yamato maps didnt play ror yet hope lot changed ror maps refined didnt really need reworkoverall play game campaign even difficulty curve place still plays really good dont bother multiplayer people playing superior aoe definitive great piece history despite aging good still damn fine playimproved ai skirmishes campaign ai seems less

aloneit little value beyond nostalgia team behind done great job bringing newer standard game really fun return childhood although game really great game much fun also great tool learning history multiplayer games brought family back together game fun like thank game funbut hard control unit psif used play dont recommend two better game rehashing classic albeit entirely outshined game inception rts genre quality life improvements great opportunity diehard fans play classic game modern hardware modern waywhats great execution gtx setup although cpu bottlenecked youd think wouldnt much trouble running game effectively although run modern games play save euiv one seems get abysmally poor graphics settings dont help much either setting makes discernible difference scaling drop menu putting seems affect sprites used zoomedin game rather anything might affect actual cpu usagesave main menu every screen looks straight tier noname get buying random steam key bad multiplayer chore well trying navigate menus find lobby deal fact ranks broken since launch year ago therefore ranked matching finding game general ive ever able find people online despite much higher playerbasefrom game standpoint title doesnt hold either especially greater titles aoe ii aoe iii yes know run well proper looking menus game magnitude consistent online playerbase importantly civilizations doubt lifeblood every rts game minute advantages disadvantages civilization may another rts game every civilization would grow old fast exactly age empires de original early rts game included number civilizations none advantages eg speical units special buildings etc instead found de facto differences owning entirely units great pool didnt access say difference chinese greeks chinese dont access phalanx upgrade tree original also bonuses exacerbated differences factions gameplay changes hittites health bonus catapults even changed de lowered making difference gameplay much less civilizations explains unlike age empires ii de aoe de didnt see addition new civs theres way differentiate already existing civs without adding new units access toalthough enjoy game really tide release age empires ii de cant recommend anyone looking get rts isnt explicitly age empires best version first game run modern operating systemsd game provides nice flashback original game period taking back memories original units considering infantry structures preserved gameplay enhanced creating really vivid fancy experience graphics decent campaigns stories insightful guys love history game great choice play info walkthrough definitely recommend points game part childhood fact im playing adult brings much nostalgia hadnt invested much time game refunded explain later say gameplay

seen done older game impressive even ai give serve ball deserves good outta wish put little bit game farms auto reseed still cant build gates greatest letdown game remake ever main problem new graphics new graphics make gameplay feel awkward clunky villager walk animation build animations dont look natural horse looks like brand new born baby horse trying gallop first time units dont look cool classic version mention game zoomed really close play classic style game updated looks feels much better cheap reskin slapped sadly reason would suggest getting classic version brilliant game loved original age empires bought disc windows xp fun love little men walking around building town city love custom campaigns well set ones love everything great find thank steam classic rts play never game twice love replayability notion started playing aoe first debuted still fresh clear cash grab wasnt made give funthey could made many little tweaks make playablecant recommend game even

spot additional benefit learning history peoples ancient times hope enjoy playing much fantastic upgrade amazing classic still provides endless hours fun like first day played although older game still great visuals challenging creative game well worth buy great game updated original classic version great game work perfect age empires rebootthe voice acting marvelous campaign narrations unit grunts normally wouldnt mention smooth professional overlookedthe music also really well done heard excellent remake original primitive midi soundtrackand turned right soundtrack fitting stays enjoyable throughout gamethere stutter issues though first start new game game stutters starts playing smooth random fps drops across game priest sprite also stuttering positions like moving straight upwardsnow need effort terms pathfinding well cant complain pathfinding original year old game horrible one much better playable leastthey also need remake original intro cutscenes opinion game doesnt feel without old charmthe major downer lack indian civlization despite richest ever imperial civilization human history industrial era extremely powerful era one point largest form mauryan empire original ms devs left india reason definitive edition sadly would love see india civ game either unified one like broken two distinctive cultures arya dravidaa good game far id happily recommend anyone familiar franchise pretty good game though one favorites probably would really liked played original back day since didnt nostalgia factor doesnt play like visuals though soundtrack really catchy however playing could tell old game doesnt refinements qualityoflife features recent rts titles still entertaining times got lost lost track time decent repainting classic really fun game play easily pause middle life things need get done rewritten review loved great game happy play updated graphics first downloaded played game difficulties constant crashes displeased however short developers game published new update fix problem far problems allhow team behind game handled situation wasnt one problem look game see team behind age empires de truly want old classic best happy say done really good job treat fans classic age empires numerous quality life upgrades also addresses lopsided nature many bonuses classic version balance changes gripe doesnt go way army formations gates option start dedicated scout basically graphically technologically uplifted version classic aoe experience includes content base aoe rise rome expansion pack conveniently combined separate executables original release means everything aoe better worse con think original pathfinding ai sometimes craps needs little bit babying original enough really problem happen twice course entire ascent egypt learning campaigning consider pretty good essentially era strategy game overall would definetely recommend defacto way play modern systems imo best entry point new players classic experience almost none classic jankyness brilliant mostly way remember playable graphics updated looks great runs well issue miss able upgrade space age gates walls bit strange would still give top rating recommendation great feel would better could go original eras far challenging chance build ais attack continue attacking fun remember good stuff like remember original additions issue mouse freeze rarely second game also select game looks like originally selecting option change anything still real crashes would highly recommend game significantly difficult newer aoe games im greatest player world standard difficulty game like hard aoe even easy theyre pretty aggressive tech trees dont make sense locations various techs research really odd computer also super smart knows target lowest health units battles thing genuinely superior least compared aoe autorebuild farm option newer versions polishedrefined user friendly isnt worth playing one better options great blast past fond memories original game played family growing definitive edition lives memories best classic rts game genius always classic aofe game lovely hires texture graphics great quality life featureshowever many users found fps game appalling performance obviously system specific makes sense remastered modern version classic run well major graphics cards seems im alone game runs poorly gpus capable running game fps clearly implemented well wish could got refund ive heard aofe ii successful first pc game ive ever played years later even better updated graphics havent changed much updating visuals

que recomendo fez parte da minha e agora sem passarei um bom tempo com esse jogo sempre ficamos animados quando sabemos que um jogo que amamos refeito em uma qualidade melhor mas sempre medo de estragarem tudo nao foi caso jogo ficou comprem sem medo ba criminally underrated game age empires ii blew predecessor water high still hasnt come years later said deserves time sun fantastic remasteroverall strong recommend decent value price bthe forgotten empires dev team rocky time last years releases hailed really well much age mythology hd common guys one seems one good ones aside catastrophic bugs peoples games crash game wise still game remember youre plays like age empires models much higher ress sequels spites simplicity beauty aoe simply doesnt also causes issues path

empiresthe game offers nice graphics environments although ugly glitches pleasant sameage empires definitive edition overall however fun game play get boring played long time good strategy rts game play short recommended review sources blist none finally remaster empires first pcgame came first homecomputer loved remember many great hours playing alone brother years remaster released great job still one best games ever recommendation people wanting revisit game newcomers series alike bobf bebmpires one important strategy games history true titan genre classic position lot concerns remaster game one hand fully deserves second youth todays standards pretty barebones rts mechanicswise many respects archaic position much room developers remaster want remain faithful original dozen minutes game breathed sigh relief apart beautiful audiovisual setting aoe de game extremely faithful original avoiding making changes gameplay better worse apart absolutely necessary proper functioning mainly multiplayeralthough would love see first part recreated convention current aoe ii de honest remaster required restraint creators definitely showed focusing complete reconstruction entire visual setting significantly improves experience game compared original real eye candy moment terms content quality product whole nothing much criticizefor time premiere game problems proper functioning especially ai fortunately everything patched age empires definitive edition working nicely ba fantastic way relive first time aoe lots fun single multiplayer enthusiastsif know youre getting recommend heart especially promotional campaigns steam complete entire series fraction normal price way also highly recommend going back checking original release rise rome expansion playable ever still lot magic years run fine modern systems case issues theres decent number solutions overcome worth part history real wololo start review saying game doesnt deserve negativity getting people love memeurl also love bash first age empires biggest characteristic age empires series every game unique way youre expecting similar game aoe youll disappointed keep open mind youll find lot enjoyment actual game started great reworked graphics game remaster remake means faithful original game including oldschool clunkyness still forgotten empires developers added great quality life features like farm reseeding tech queues indicator many idle villagers walkable farms higher population cap minor additions also worth mentioning ai greatly improved compared original compared microsoft store launch last year ai improvements made primarily add spice skmirmish matches sideeffect making campaign levels unfairly hard game also features reworked soundtrack recorded orchestra personally dont like muchurl composer charge changed several melodies killing nostalgic mood imagine someone rerecorded classic jonesurl theme starting fine changing notes way thats feels dont want fanciness enable modeurl custom games uses original graphics soundtrack gameplay mode poorly implemented though several reasons cant use campaigns cant use multiplayer starts vanilla soundtrack rather rise rome soundtrack like used original expansion interface definitive edition totally nostalgic cant choose midi recorded soundtrack gold edition im hoping issues solved near future would good could choose use original sound effects outside classic mode rerecorded sounds truly awful yeah changed classic url sound another rogan sounds like came drunk high pitched voice actor unbelievable sets aoe apart compared aoe never played first age empires know lot strategies age empires ii dont work starters theres gate actually love one ever safe need creative walls placement sometimes even creating mazes mashes environment theres also land trading way buy sell resources market need plan good strategy ahead soon uncover map army formations well brute raw theres scout start want explore map without hurting progress avoiding using villagers explore advance second age tool age train scout could also use clubman trained barracks theyre slow dont uncover lot map pathfinding lot simplerpoor even slightly better definitive edition compared age empires ii huge problem micromanaging units one pillars rts genre everything stated paragraph makes age empires favorite series much less automated comfortable successors providing strategic experience worth full price much love first age empires im sure could recommend full price everyone whole different beast compared age empires ii modern rts games however enjoyed original andor used older games go ahead pick right wait sale definitive edition features theyre hit miss sometimes certainly definitive im glad least considering first age
