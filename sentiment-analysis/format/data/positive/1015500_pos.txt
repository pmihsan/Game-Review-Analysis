become number contender crashes match anyway would never save thing also freezes going various modes within game like others think add old aspects previous games would say would influence decision game everything worked way would great game fix would stay away feel ripped given amount paid could gotten refund game would hesitant buy game going lie reading reviews say though havent experienced crashes minor glitches every thats really clue many people experiencing ton crashes bugs glitches like havent really experienced allmaybe depends type computer parts etc dont really know understand

files second return custom finishing moves wwe raw vs smackdown problems retry game check system settings make sure everything optimal go graphic settings set high preformance perminatly run smoothly would recommend current state game frequent crashes lack content bother campaign worst voice acting ever seen single player fixed crashes bugs added things would pretty solidnot much people playing

game even though ive put many hours count going continue play probably forseeable future yukes develops another wrestling game youre fan wwe games buy previous version whichever one minor mean minor improvements aspects previous games downgraded much worth buying even new moves characters customization options id fun auschwitz ill preface saying ive bought every mainstream wwe game launch since

game thumbs hoping fix game soon possible game definitely step back terms graphics aspects look better character models dont look good last year game tends crash lot game seems rushed theres many small mistakes easily fixed im hoping update come week fix ones making game unplayable character creation female characters really disappointing male characters many items women dont reason especially face paint masks custom logos also dont work put ingame logo mycareer characters game wont even load cutscenes skippable means lose match sometimes youve rewatch minute cutscene make game slow theres many bugs stuff cant excused want game better potential developers seem like theyre passionate game wanted succeed knew game isnt good enough yet released wait hope developers fix improve game soon listen fans still bounce back put effort improving game ive bought every thq wwe game since one worst one ive played broken buggy love creating characters best part games ive followed wwe games since day reckoning look back past way better present things fine came around franchise began downward spiral things took turn worsethe first thing plague restriction genders aka male vs female expect people relive classic moments stars like chyna cant even pit past male opponents fact youd use mod tools remove restrictions second thing absence specialty matches people raising voices demanding

crashes every time try play get work using old drivers video card still full glitches example myplayer hair render properly looks terrible glowing circles game would fun filled bugs game feels like setback compared frame rate highlight reel drops recent dlc bump night second match showcase dip noticable lag trying kick pin match overall keep playing game like step back compared last years game also optimised worse last years game habit buying games wait go sale buy fire pro wrestling world instead game patched ton nearly broken used however game still locks loading screens hour gameplay results need log windows game locks top task manager game beautiful amazing obviously doesnt work often fine soon lock pc said may destroy also controls changeable fine using different controls like reversal button x finisher may like play game way better game fun works buggy physics ugly character models tendency crash fairly often mar would otherwise really fun wrestling game unique story mode lots fun customizable match types slew fun features quirks would recommend people really look past myriad issues get dirt cheap like game broken matt hardy hes shamefully broken game even month release game still crashing im editing move set mitb completely broken showcase poorly designed act god helped finish frame rate drops certain arenas multi man matches run gtx result could worse

hilarious game running fine although dont see blood even though option enabled browsing custom created characters slow wish game faster paced arcady still pretty fun especially playing locally friendsluckily havent plagued crashing issues like others game simply broken seemed trending positive direction thats even case cant load save data correctly without game breaking sort fashion matches end middle match declaring opponent victor without type fall happening game game sucks game good love game much bugs game minus glitches good animations game good moves however lot pretty bad look

particular wrestlers entrance music game instantly vanishes screen unfortunate gameplay great game far many quirks instabilities recommend story mode pretty fun play havent stopped playing two days four key issues game lead recommend performance even months patches performance game pc subpar matches feel choppy sluggish pacing first two matches unplayable due incredibly slow performance drastically reduce graphics settings get decent performance matches rig consists gtx ryzen processor rig capable running game leads believe game poorly controller restrictions game shipped ability change controls keyboard users much appreciated options people using controller people purchase game going use controller games like built controllers mind begs question controller users limited one control scheme option remap controls use alternative control scheme providing key settings limits user default control controller scheme new edition franchise developers decided drastically change control scheme controller users unnecessary change made playing game xbox controller objectively worse key controls reversals signatures finishers paybacks dragging opponents changed button combinations make playing game incredibly cumbersome example perform finisher press press x making simple process previous game slightly difficult new game character models character models seem incredibly rushed models superstars like roman reigns feel polished models superstars seem lack quality control example playing match elias entrance playing witness one wonky set facial animations eyes elias looked demented deranged teeth unnaturally white taunt audio certain superstars sync superstar animationsconclusion game still long way away polished well performing game recommend anyone
