The puzzle can vary from pretty difficult to fairly simple but all of them work like a real escape room would which is 'the answer is usually very obvious and within your grasp, it will not be attached under a chair or under the carpet'\n3. Playing with my friend has felt good and made it worthwhile to keep coming back, I feel for the room sizes having four people feels a little crowded (the newer content fixes this problem)\n4. All the updates and DLC have been awesome and worth playing, I really appriciate having a reason to come back and keep playing \n5. Having the ability to make your own escape room and play other peoples escape rooms is really cool for a feature, it lets people live our there escape room dreams and play themed escape rooms that are fun each time (I do wish there was a mod or something like this that tested the room for bugs or impossible puzzles because about 70% of them have one of these that make it so I have to stop playing the community room)\n6. If the devs ever think about doing a collab with another game series or movie people or tv series, I would be honored to play it because that would be really cool to have something like Final Fantasy Midgard Themed Escape (that would be really cool)\n7. I dont know if this is in the community rooms but if you have a import my model/sprites in feature thats cool since then people can be more creative about making a room to show to others \n\nThat is all, thanks for making me love Escape Rooms more than I already did, it made me want to try to IRL Escape Rooms if I get the chance to \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1678400762, "timestamp_updated": 1678400762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1678455078, "developer_response": "Wow, thank you so much for the overwhelmingly positive review!

They're really small, and any more than two people would feel suffocating to me. So if you're thinking of getting this to play with your crew, rather than with your BFF or partner... maybe consider something else.\n\nThat said, it's exactly what it says on the label. You have a bunch of rooms to escape, grouped by different themes. The rooms that come with the game have your typical moon logic where you need to use your intuition, hunches, and the knowledge that every puzzle has a solution that can be physically found in the area. Classic.\n\nI personally found the difficulty fun and just right, but my \"friend\" found herself frustrated in the latter stages. She still solved her fair share of puzzles, mind; and when things get too tough, there's a helpful hint button that often points you towards that one thing you're missing - usually without straight out giving you the answer.\n\nWe beat all the pre-packaged rooms but didn't touch the community ones - and it seems like that's where the meat is. Who knows, maybe we'll check them out at some point, but in the end we aren't that much into escape rooms. Still, it was a pleasant experience for what it was.\n\nIf you like escape rooms, you're definitely going to like Escape Simulator. The only criticism I can think of is that the character customisation options are somewhat lacking, and the victory dances are incredibly awkward - especially clapping, I'm not even sure if that's supposed to be clapping... but hey, you're here to escape rooms, not to watch your characters do silly poses, right?\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988/]Curator page[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1677917147, "timestamp_updated": 1677917147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542196512222290039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134023457": {"recommendationid": "134023457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031895120", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 75, "playtime_at_review": 1055, "last_played": 1678767160}, "language": "english", "review": "I love escape rooms and had been trying to find a replacement for in-person escape rooms since I haven't been able to do as many of those.

Started off playing with my wife and we both had a blast once we figured out the mechanics of the game. It's simple enough, but very satisfying. We didn't beat the timer on the first few levels, but once we got the hang of it, we managed to clear a lot of levels within the timeframe. It's nice to not get kicked out of the room when the timer is done, like you do sometimes in real escape rooms. We didn't use any hints and just let the timer run out if we needed to. Having the tokens to find in the rooms was a nice touch as well.\n\nI typically play with a higher FOV than default in most games, so I adjusted my FOV accordingly. I recommend not doing this, as it looks quite weird. The 3D nature of the game is already not the best, so you don't want to mess with it. It's forgivable for what the game is.\n\nThe game has a large community fan-base which designs levels that you can play. Many are quite good, and some are very hard. I also made a few levels for my wife as gifts and it was awesome to see her enjoy something I crafted just for her! The toolkit for design is quite powerful, and you can do a lot with it. I look forward to future developments to this portion of the game.\n\nThis game is probably fun on it's own, but I'd imagine it's more fun with at least one other person. I'd highly recommend it at full price; it's honestly worth more. If it's on sale, it's a no-brainer. I typically don't review games until I'm done with them, but this game continues to offer DLC for purchase, so I decided I needed to go ahead and just review it. I'm also really happy that they've released a few free rooms since launch. It's nice to see a dev support a game with both free and paid content as time goes on, and when there isn't any, the community rooms are great.

There are also more free rooms in development, which i am looking forward to playing once they come out. One thing i will say is that it does stick pretty hard to the escape room formula, in that the end goal of every room is the exact same: to open a door to escape. Considering the freedoms afforded by this being a video game, I think there could be some more variety in what the goal is (stealing a gem, pressing a button before the room explodes, etc...), but its a pretty minor gripe.

From there, players are given fifteen or more minutes to solve all the puzzles in the room and escape them. \n\nAfter fifteen minutes though, luckily the game doesn\u2019t stop but lets players escape however long it takes.  The fifteen minutes is the time to be awarded a \u201cTrophy\u201d for a set of achievements, conceptually an interesting idea, but having a major flaw in that after a player solves a single room, they can usually re-run that escape in a fraction of the time, since most of the puzzles have been solved.\n\nThat\u2019s ultimately the biggest issue that Escape Simulator runs into, escape rooms or Escape games only work a single time.  The experience has to be magical for the players because after the puzzles are solved and players leave the room, there\u2019s no reason to return.  The good news with Escape Simulator is there\u2019s the ability for fans to upload their levels, but ultimately players will be at the mercy of the other designers. \n\nAs for the core levels of Escape Simulator, every level feels both unique and interesting, and I spent at least 5 hours enjoying the game.  When a level is tuned just right, the experience feels amazing, but there are at least two or three puzzles that I\u2019m not sure how to solve. \n\nInside the game, there\u2019s the ability to press a button and get a \u201chint\u201d with that button then give a new hint after each press.  This is the best way to handle these puzzles so players don\u2019t get spoiled by guides, however, those two or three puzzles I mentioned were ones where after all the hints were given I still have no clue the direction the game wanted me to go without the external guides' assistance.  \n\nThat\u2019s always going to be a problem and with each puzzle only having one path to the solution, if a player misses a logical leap it leaves them needing to go to a guide to get the solution, and Escape Simulator does have a decent number of those leaps at times.\n\nSimilarly, there are 8 hidden tokens to find per level, which only grants an additional achievement per set of levels.  Many of these are well hidden and will be things people will notice as they play through a level, but again this is something a guide is going to be useful for unless players want to examine every texture and location in a game.  \n\nIn addition, there\u2019s also a co-op mode, which makes sense as Escape Rooms are intended to be played by multiple people, but I feel like co-op would weaken the experience here because, for each player, there\u2019s a 50 percent chance of solving a specific puzzle, a second person might help for when players get stuck, but for the most part, the desire would be to increase the experience for the player, not skip half of it while working with another person.  For a large escape room, more players are necessary because there\u2019s too much to do, but Escape Simulator never reaches that scale or necessity.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of puzzles, Escape Simulator is a good time.  There\u2019s a lot of variety in the puzzles and well-designed locations, but after finishing the game, I have an issue, there\u2019s only a handful of puzzles that stood out, and I believe that\u2019s because there are limited tools for designing the level.  \n\nLast year I played Escape Academy which is a story-based game focused on Escape Rules.  Academy had only 13 levels, half the number in Escape Simulator, but when looking at both games, Escape Simulator didn\u2019t stand out as much.  Escape Academy was a more impressive game, due to its variety and how every level stood out as a unique experience.  Many of those rooms were unique in that a real escape room wouldn\u2019t be able to do the same things in the real world.  In Escape Simulator, every room feels like players are once again in a room of the same size and shape, and while the puzzles are unique, the grandiose feeling of solving a once-in-a-lifetime escape room is missing, and that\u2019s really what Escape Simulator could have provided.  The feeling of solving an escape room that would be impossible to do in real life. \n\n7/10\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1675586515, "timestamp_updated": 1675586515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555555582046508789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132234445": {"recommendationid": "132234445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198821863548", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 708, "playtime_at_review": 7380, "last_played": 1678604835}, "language": "english", "review": "Some community rooms are broken, but its allowed me to spend so much time with my family back home. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1675570437, "timestamp_updated": 1675570437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132226247": {"recommendationid": "132226247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358064061", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 618, "last_played": 1676787228}, "language": "english", "review": "hidden stuff", "timestamp_created": 1675558438, "timestamp_updated": 1675558438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132215577": {"recommendationid": "132215577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016075384", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 372, "playtime_at_review": 3436, "last_played": 1678740502}, "language": "english", "review": "great co-op game, community made rooms are good", "timestamp_created": 1675544984, "timestamp_updated": 1675544984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132144690": {"recommendationid": "132144690", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998680878", "num_games_owned": 781, "num_reviews": 263, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 93, "last_played": 1671852800}, "language": "english", "review": "Good puzzles and incredible amount of community content.", "timestamp_created": 1675455407, "timestamp_updated": 1675455407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132138573": {"recommendationid": "132138573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198855074111", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 736, "last_played": 1675484502}, "language": "english", "review": "pp\n", "timestamp_created": 1675447922, "timestamp_updated": 1675447922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132122786": {"recommendationid": "132122786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141135784", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1672696831}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty cool with friends", "timestamp_created": 1675429581, "timestamp_updated": 1675429581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132102143": {"recommendationid": "132102143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273536658", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 155, "playtime_at_review": 906, "last_played": 1677899819}, "language": "english", "review": "So much fun, love playing the base rooms and the community rooms so much!

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

There are a lot of rooms near us and in less than a 1-hour drive but it's tough to synchronize our schedules to find more than 1 slot a month to play. We needed a faster, easier method to play some cooperative puzzles and that's how we found Escape Simulator!\n\nIt's a bit different feeling than analog rooms but it's close enough. Puzzles are diverse - based on locks, ciphers, puzzle boxes, etc. as well as electronic devices, physical/chemical/biological experiments, and old-school items breaking with a hammer. Rooms made by devs follow certain schema but it's not repetitive nor boring - you learn new tricks in almost every scenario. In general, we enjoy this game, and are coming back to it now and then to calm down the urge to go to a real-life Escape Room when we can't find enough free time or money :D\n\n[u]PROS:[/u]\n- pretty - this game looks really lovely. Cartoon graphics makes everything very readable and sharp so it's pretty hard to not notice important puzzles\n- very creative puzzles - even though there are a lot of locks in almost all dev rooms you don't get bored with them because it's always a different way to get the combination. Secrets are in general nicely hidden sometimes even in plain sight, you don't get too much headache over them but get that nice rush of satisfaction after figuring them out.\n- good implementation of clues - I wouldn't say rooms are linear. Multiple puzzles are available from the start and I don't think we had to start with a particular one even once. What we found more challenging was to divide them between ourselves. This is also not your typical Point'n'Click game when you have to combine items 'till they work. Most clues are simple but specific, you can easily figure out where to use them. Some clues are maybe too guiding but for good reason (why would anyone write a vague book?). When you are stuck you can always use a hint button and those clues are very nicely done (we used them maybe 3 times across all rooms available in the base game and both DLCs).\n- cool design - rooms have themes and they are designed very well. Music fits nicely, sounds are immersive, and items scattered around are just enough distracting.\n- workshop support - community rooms vary in quality but the best ones made our jaws drop. It's marvelous what people can make with the in-game level editor and we are actively waiting for the next rooms of our favorite creators. \n- controls - those are fine. You can pin items to your view, wear certain objects, and take a look at what your buddy is doing. The only thing that bugged me a little was the unintuitive way of picking up items but I got used to it.\n\n[u]CONS:[/u]\n- some bugs - it's not bad but some stuff happened. Once the script didn't start at all  - we still could finish the room by brute force (but we didn't) but we couldn't access certain mechanics and clues. In the other room, one puzzle glitched and was unsolvable. For both cases, the game restart helped. I think if you are not trying to fight with this game the chance of getting bugs or glitches is low.\n- no VR support - this game would be so good in VR. I get that it's probably way too hard to implement it satisfyingly but still - I wish I could play it with goggles.\n- the number of people playing matters a lot - the first couple of rooms didn't have enough puzzles to share between 4 people and we still had this issue from time to time later on. Sometimes 4 people trying to solve 4 puzzles generate too much chaos, other times 4 people are working on a single puzzle and struggle to communicate effectively. We played token hunting when someone didn't have any input. Some rooms are almost claustrophobic when played as 4 player team. \n\nIn general - worth the price, worth the time, worth the fun :)", "timestamp_created": 1672653989, "timestamp_updated": 1672656994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129917814": {"recommendationid": "129917814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030046699", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "playtime_at_review": 1399, "last_played": 1678685859}, "language": "english", "review": "Well worth it - a great game to play with friends or partner.

Only downside so far as I've seen, is that you don't get to complete one room to be able to go into another room that you also have to solve to then eventually escape. It is literally just 'one room' all the puzzles are in. BUT, some rooms actually let you interact from afar outside the room you are in- like an Egyptian level with vast land around you- that makes it feel more expansive and interactive beyond the bounding room.\n\nPuzzle will get hard. Only in level 3 or 4 of the Space themed ones did my mom and I end up getting stuck in for maybe an *hour*. It actually dealt with 'science'- molecules to be specific. I felt like I should have paid more attention in school because of that level lol. We were sooo stumped; and we were determined to never use hints. We didn't use hints still no, and eventually she figured out, but I would have never solved it myself.\n\nOn that note: Def more fun and better with a person or two, even if it's a touch chaotic cause the room is really small/compact/clastrophobic.\n\nAdded Pro: Other people can make rooms and share them, like a level maker. Like some other games, people can make their own rooms and post to public for them to play.\n\n - This means aside from the 'main story' ones (not really stories), there is still many more rooms you can try and play because of community~. So you aren't just paying for one game that you play once and never come back to- because the rooms do not randomize the puzzles. I have confidence there are some good community ones~. There are smart people out there!\n\nCons: Some controls make me confused and get finger twistered. Some buttons do the same thing as another button, so you might accidentally hit that button or a dif one and does something you didn't want to be done making items appear on screen, then drop, or go to bag, and lkasjdf.\nSome Puzzles are easy to complete with 'trial and error' tries, that would mean not needing an object that would have solved it: BUT, most the puzzles still have alot to do and solve that are harder in the same level~.", "timestamp_created": 1672089150, "timestamp_updated": 1672089150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129366865": {"recommendationid": "129366865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130002297", "num_games_owned": 640, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1671833203}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes!", "timestamp_created": 1672087138, "timestamp_updated": 1672087138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129366215": {"recommendationid": "129366215", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998798381", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 941, "last_played": 1675824211}, "language": "english", "review": "Puzzles are not too difficult and they all seem to have a logical throughway.

Sometimes you know what you need to solve but not how and other times you know what you are trying to work with but need the corresponding riddle. All puzzles feel 'in place' for whatever theme the room has. The ability to play workshop content also increases the amount of rooms playable to nigh infinite. On top of that there are dlc's that are being released at a reasonable price.

On one hand, it can be a fun, challenging, brain tickler that brings people together in an attempt to beat a wonderfully crafted collection of various themed puzzle rooms, bringing you and your partner or group of friends (max 3), across the ruins of ancient Egypt to a dishevelled mess of a space ship thousands of years into the future. It allows everyone to put their collective brain cells together, with everyone having their own euphoric \"EUREKA!\" moment, as your group applauds the person that cracked that one code, or found that certain message hidden in plain sight. \n\nOn the other, however, thanks to its physics engine, it could also be a game where you and your group run around like headless chickens. Each one of you channeling your inner goblin brain by smashing, breaking, and turning over anything and everything until you stumble across the solution to a puzzle no one had a clue was even a puzzle in the first place, before a satisfying chime sounds and is followed up with a notification saying \"X solved a puzzle\" that appears in the lower corner of your screen. The group of idiots that you love hanging out with so much will live up to that name when each and every one of you fails to see the solution to a puzzle that, in hindsight wasn't much of a thinker, to begin with, but leaves you all collectively slapping your foreheads. Simultaneously and equally dumbfounded that no one thought about doing that one thing sooner. It's fine though, just say that you're \"tired\". I'm sure that excuse will work after the one-hundredth time... right?\n\nHowever you play it and whoever you play it with, it is safe to say that you will have a blast going through the collection of lovingly detailed levels if you enjoy testing that ol' noggin of yours. Best yet, it isn't graphically intensive whatsoever so many people can have the ability to just boot it up and play with little to no hassle. If you're done with everything the game has to throw at you, why not download some of the community levels to keep the fun going?

May it be through the vastly expanding creative Community Rooms, Free Expansions, Festive Seasonal Updates like last Halloween or thematic DLC's... We've been playing this game on a regular basis and [b] still haven't pushed through all the content! [/b]\n\nThere is a truly HUGE amount of variety you\u2019re getting here. Since the Room Creator allows for almost endless creative freedom and the possibility to mod as well, the community rooms expand the already rich content of the base game even further! From horror and unique science-fiction takes, abstract art puzzles and medieval themes to safari like exploration of catacombs! You can decide which kind of different experience you want to get into every time you play!\n\nI want to mention that this game is also perfectly fit for playing alone! Especially as a chill evening activity, if you just want to relax a bit. Yet the mere amount of laughs I've been able to share with friends are reason enough to recommend this to be enjoyed together! \n\nSo what you are actually getting by buying this game, is an ever expanding repertoire of unique Escape Rooms! And a great sandbox if you like to create something yourself.\n -> Which, for now, isn't even closely conveyed through the price! \n\n[b] 10/10 [/b] - The perfect addition for every puzzle game fan!

As each room is meant to take 15 minutes each to complete, this gives you approximately 4 x 5 x 15 = 300 minutes (5 hours) of content. There are also 4 \"extra\" rooms that were added on as free DLC for seasonal events (such as Christmas and Halloween). These are generally a little longer. Santa's Workshop follows the standard 15 minute completion time, but Graveyard, Cats in Time, and 70's Room are all designated as 30 minute rooms. Thus, in total you are getting about 300 + 15 + 30 x 3 = 405 minutes or just under 7 hours. All of this for just 15 dollars is a pretty good value proposition in my opinion and I have not even mentioned the community maps yet. I should also mention that there are 2 more $5 paid DLC which add about 3 more hours each. \n\nPart of what also makes this game great is that all of the levels have different themes to their puzzles and environments. This helps each level have a fresh feel to it and also helps the modding community by adding more assets to the large pool they already provide. It is precisely the modding community that gives this game near infinite replay-ability, as new maps  come out almost every day and the game does a good job of curating the maps so you can find the most polished ones.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, I found most of the puzzles to be pretty easy, with only a few rare puzzles really setting me back. Nevertheless, I love puzzle games and I had a blast solving all of the puzzles in this game. I would say that the experience is augmented when playing with friends as all of the rooms can be solved pretty efficiently in parallel and your friends can sometimes provide you with a much needed change in perspective to solve a puzzle.", "timestamp_created": 1669275113, "timestamp_updated": 1669275113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126547484": {"recommendationid": "126547484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159299949", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 382, "last_played": 1662529010}, "language": "english", "review": "will prove who is the smarter friend", "timestamp_created": 1669274236, "timestamp_updated": 1669274236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126542754": {"recommendationid": "126542754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388052312", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 68, "playtime_at_review": 648, "last_played": 1678485986}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't wait to play this with other people!!\n\nIt is quite challenging, which I find very fun, even though it shows that I am much more stupid than I hoped I was.\nIt went as far as even making it a challenge to play a non-puzzle driven game afterwards, because my brain had to think too much outside the box, lol.", "timestamp_created": 1669271930, "timestamp_updated": 1669271930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126530503": {"recommendationid": "126530503", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967325197", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6463, "last_played": 1657679623}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, continue to add more rooms and also update their tools for workshop maps.\nAlso a fun speed game.", "timestamp_created": 1669265825, "timestamp_updated": 1669265825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126488964": {"recommendationid": "126488964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115050918", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 686, "last_played": 1669247726}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, innovative game. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1669247786, "timestamp_updated": 1669247786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126477821": {"recommendationid": "126477821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098570390", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1669243260}, "language": "english", "review": "Escape rooms (:", "timestamp_created": 1669243529, "timestamp_updated": 1669243529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517345786094665527", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126433081": {"recommendationid": "126433081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112807135", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 816, "last_played": 1671317660}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun puzzle / escape room game with friends!

The solution to each room often allows for multiple puzzles to be worked on at once, ensuring your partner finds something productive to do simultaneously. The devs are constantly working on more content, and Steam Workshop support makes for a technically endless amount of additional bonus content as well.\n\nI had an insanely good time playing it with my partner in crime challenging ourselves to complete each level in less than 15 min while avoiding to use any hints and finding all tokens.\n\n [u]Pros[/u] \n\n+ Charming and vibrant cartoony visual style\n+ Limited but lovely character customization\n+ Intuitive and challenging puzzles\n+ Supportive in-game hint system\n+ Endless custom levels\n\n [u]Cons[/u] \n\n- No mid-level save option \n- A couple of minor bugs\n\nThis is easily one of my favourite casual solo and co-op puzzle games available, and well worth picking up.

I've only played it solo, or working together with a friend sitting with me. \n\nSome of the puzzles aren't very intuitive (maybe I'm really stupid). I get this main idea of what I need to do, but it's not obvious how to do it. Also some puzzles need you to keep looking at different items and it can be frustrating, especially if you have a rubbish memory like me, to have to keep going back and forth. I literally had to get out a notebook to scribble things down to keep a track of it. It would be nice if you could look at a couple items at the same time, or have a virtual notepad to type relevant details down.\n\nThe hint system; mixed bag. Unlike a real escape room, where you have someone monitoring you who can give you relevant clues based off of how far into the puzzle you are, Escape Simulator can't be quite as intuitive, so often you understand roughly what you have to do but often (for me) not how to execute it. The little pictures tend to follow a pattern of an image of the player reading relevant notes (done that), then some more diagrams of things I already understand or have done. That can make the game frustrating in a not fun way.\n\nIt doesn't work exactly like a real escape room, but it has some of those elements. I don't want to be completely negative; there are interesting puzzles and things to do, though sometimes I wish the rooms were a little bigger, though given how bad I've been at some of them perhaps that would make it harder. \n\nIf you're really into escape rooms and don't have the time/ability to gather your friends or family for a real escape room, this could be a fun diversion in the meantime.\n\nOverall, I like it more than it annoys me.

Hope you like key locks, combination locks, and keypads!\n\nI will say that, while the game allows you to play with upwards of 8-10 people, playing with 1-2 cooperators is most ideal. The base-game rooms are pretty small and there really isn't too much for more people to do.\nIf someone's holding onto something you need, you have no way of really knowing what that is unless they give it to you. Play with people who know how to communicate.\n\nA few criticisms that probably can't be helped, but I still really like this game.

However, you can find small notes/hints that can reveal some small details about what was going on.  There are several groups of rooms, each with a different theme.  This keeps things interesting and makes you want to explore every different room you find yourself in.  Puzzles also vary between rooms and themes keep them feeling fresh.  Once you\u2019re done with a room, there\u2019s not much of a reason to play it again as nothing is changed.  Fortunately, there are new rooms that come out from the developers and from the community that keep the game going.  You can even make your own rooms if you want.\n\nThe Bad:  The main issue I have is with the clock.  All of the puzzles are doable, but the clock kept putting unneeded pressure to look at hints.  I tried to ignore it, but it\u2019s usually in a very prominent place.  The only other issue is with the inventory and how you can put quite a lot of things into your inventory bar and have no idea if things are useful or not.  I would not mind if there was a different way to view or go through your inventory once it gets crowded.\n\nOverall:  I\u2019d recommend this game to anyone who like puzzle games.  I originally got this after playing \u201cThe Room\u201d series of games and also wanting to try escape rooms.

My score of 6 is not a reflection of the graphics not being good its just not that type of a game and to put a higher number would only just pump up the overall score without the game being a AAA kind of game. The graphics are really good though each item is clear, and the designs are fun both base and community content. The rooms and environments are fun to play in and it never gets boring\n\n[h1] sound and music [/h1]  5/10\nAgain, like many scores the sound and music is not something this game needs to or does well. Its basic with sounds of various objects being interacted with and the music itself I find to mute as it all gets quite repetitive and in the way after a while\n\n\n[h1] game play [/h1]  9/10\nThis is where the game shines. This is a great sit back with your controller and work stuff out chilled out game. It will get you brain going and a hand pad and pen will be needed to note stuff down. You play themes levels each with puzzles tied into that theme all blended with superb environments. The solo game is great for chilled out games and the coop is so much fun when you want to have a blast with a friend solving the rooms. The game play is a warm welcome when you want a break from the RPG and shooters in your library. This is a go to game every now and again when I want a break and not be hunched up over my desk.\n\n[h1] controls [/h1]   8/10\nOverall controls are great not many buttons and all of them placed perfectly on the game pad with the exception of a couple things like placing stuff around or dragging items but nothing too game breaking. Not sure about using a keyboard and mouse but I would imagine these are fine as well but this is a great game for once to lean back in a chair away from the monitor to play with a gamepad. \n\n[h1] Story [/h1]    7/10\nAgain its hard to put a higher score on the story as its not the kind of game that has a story other than themed escape rooms all linked in to each other however the puzzle writing and concept would play a part in the story for each room and these are done very well\n\n\n[h1] conclusion [/h1]    \nThe game is a gem and one that has come a long way and compared to many in the genre this one has the brain teasing fun element with its cartoon style graphics and challenging puzzles. The community-based content is great as well to see what ideas others come up with. With regular community rooms added daily and monthly you are never to short of having a challenge with also the option to make up your own escape rooms as well. Solo or coop this game is perfect in your library of games when you want something relaxing but also challenging without the mouse and button mashing \nOverall solid 36 out of 50  for the game  This game gets a star buy token as it is a great game \nThe overall score is not reflection of the game itself as this game is quite unique to most other games where graphics, score , sound effects are important elements of the game. This game although looks good does not depend on nor does it try to be the best in these areas and that is why the review is scored low in these areas and not because they are bad\n", "timestamp_created": 1664564604, "timestamp_updated": 1664564604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123083681": {"recommendationid": "123083681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353137432", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 286, "last_played": 1677796942}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely fun to play with your friends!

themed escape rooms.\n\nIf you\u2019ve played any similar games most of the puzzle types will feel familiar. Search around the room and look inside drawers and other containers to find keys and other important items and clues. Decipher symbols and riddles to identify numbered codes, use letters to spell passwords, rearrange pictures into the correct order, and use spare parts to repair machines.\n\nMost of the puzzles are well designed. The store page seems to suggest that playing coop is best, but I had no problems playing solo. In most cases the puzzles need to be solved one at a time anyway to acquire the next item or clue that is needed to solve the next puzzle. It took me 9 hours to complete the official rooms and in addition to this there are community designed rooms which I haven\u2019t tried yet, so there\u2019s a lot of content. \n\nHowever, this game has one significant flaw \u2013 your progress within each room is not saved. If you exit the game before completing a room, you\u2019ll have to start that room again from the beginning.\n\nOne of the most important tools in my puzzle solving arsenal is simply walking away when I\u2019m stuck, and then trying again later. Usually when I come back to a puzzle and look at it again with fresh eyes, I\u2019ll see something that I missed before, or I\u2019ll have a different idea about how to interpret the clues. But doing that in this game could mean losing 10-15 minutes of progress on multiple other puzzles within the room, so on the few occasions that I was seriously stuck, I felt pressured to solve it immediately.\n\nThere were a few times, especially in the space and office themed rooms, where I needed a 3 digit code to enter into a 0-9 keypad, but because there was something that I didn\u2019t understand in the moment and I didn\u2019t want to have to do the whole room again, I just sat and brute forced it. 000. 001. 002. 003. And yeah, I got it done eventually, but I didn\u2019t enjoy having to do that. If the game would save my progress, I\u2019m sure I would have been able to solve those puzzles properly, which would have been much more fun.\n\nOverall Escape Simulator is a good game, but that one serious design flaw causes some moments of extreme frustration that I don\u2019t usually feel while playing my favourite puzzle games.", "timestamp_created": 1663195541, "timestamp_updated": 1663195541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745276391506195068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122238828": {"recommendationid": "122238828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048560899", "num_games_owned": 1338, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 455, "last_played": 1669525175}, "language": "english", "review": "I escaped", "timestamp_created": 1663176793, "timestamp_updated": 1663176793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122213642": {"recommendationid": "122213642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400642031", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 62, "last_played": 1666126652}, "language": "english", "review": "one of my new favourite games! was really really tempted to just stay up and play it all night but had to talk myself out of it so i have more to play next time i can! really nice graphics, and puzzles are super enjoyable as they require genuine thought without being really frustrating - will update once i've played all the non-workshop games", "timestamp_created": 1663127511, "timestamp_updated": 1663127511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122204542": {"recommendationid": "122204542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090786051", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 445, "last_played": 1664146897}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would find the pickle again", "timestamp_created": 1663107780, "timestamp_updated": 1663107780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122195202": {"recommendationid": "122195202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198826736845", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 706, "last_played": 1667769505}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game to train your brain", "timestamp_created": 1663092025, "timestamp_updated": 1663092025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122184639": {"recommendationid": "122184639", "author": {"steamid": "76561199102555968", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 312, "last_played": 1668705646}, "language": "english", "review": "VERY GOOD GAEM MAKE ME REAGE", "timestamp_created": 1663076636, "timestamp_updated": 1663076636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122182706": {"recommendationid": "122182706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152932420", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1661292729}, "language": "english", "review": "A very realistic game for those who can't do escape rooms in real life.

You and up to 2 other people if you want to, are put into, as the title suggests, escape rooms and you have to get out. The interactivity with items is great and leads to many puzzle possibilities. Most of the campaigns are great, although a few levels of a certain campaign and one level from another were frustratingly obtuse. Its a good thing that these levels are the exception, so that should not be a big concern if you want to buy this. The majority content is great and quite creative. Aside from escaping the rooms, there are also trophies you can acquire if you can complete the rooms under a certain time constraint. If completing them quickly isn't your thing, there are also optional hidden tokens in the rooms. 10 tokens in each room. I will say though that these usually weren't fun to find and were unusually difficult. Sometimes they are found inside or under objects that you can hold and some of these rooms can hold a lot of individual objects, so finding them can get quite tedious. There are also a few tokens that are out of your reach and you have to look at it from far away and somehow use telekinesis to grab them. Its very odd\n\nThe only other complaint I have is a sort of personal one and I don't expect many others to share this as a negative, but the levels are, in square footage, mostly quite small. This is made worse if you bring multiple people. You might start to feel cramped in the rooms. I personally wish the rooms were larger in size.\n\n If you like puzzle games and have Steam friends that like puzzle games, this is a must buy. that's not to say this game in unenjoyable alone. Being by yourself helps with the small space anyway. I would also heavily recommend  buying the Steampunk campaign.

The rooms included in the game fun, well thought out, and challenging. Some puzzles have me stumped, then the glorious \"aha moment\" hits and you actually feel engaged. The workshop rooms can be amazing and the community has made some spectacular puzzles. The game has a built in \"daily puzzles\" that serve up the best puzzles from the workshop. And if you feel genuinely stuck, then the built in clues give a hint without giving away the whole puzzle, which is a difficult thing to find.\n\nThe art style is very simple, kinda cutesy, but it means that you aren't bombarded by detail not necessary to the core gameplay loop.\n\nIf you enjoy working the brain a bit more than what AAA games (like the Tomb Raider reboots or God of War 4) seem to think you're capable off, then I highly recommend this one.\n\nP.S.

This game is a great alternative as far as I'm concerned.  I've only played solo, however, so I can't comment on the co-op play.\nI also haven't tried any community rooms yet or the DLC.\n\nPros:\n-The visuals are great\n-The tutorial is excellent at explaining the mechanics\n-The majority of puzzles have a clue on how to solve them in the room, as is usual\n-Puzzles range from an immediate \"I know what I have to do for this one\" to \"what the heck am I supposed to do next?!\"\n-The sound which goes off when you get something right is a rewarding rush of dopamine\n-Collectibles for all the trophy hunters out there\n-Some silly things you can do in a few chambers (like throwing a skull in a fire) just for the lols\n-You don't have to escape the room in 15 minutes (the timer on the wall) your first run; you can always go back and speedrun it for the trophy.  In fact, you'll probably wind up doing so\n-A good amount of locations, and four of them have five different chambers to get through\n-The community can make their own rooms which you can play through, giving the game even more life and making it worth the price\n-You can customize your character; options are a bit limited, but it's still a nice feature\n-Token hunting can be a fun breather if you're stuck on a puzzle; you might also notice something you missed that way\n-There's a button on the wall you can press for a hint with zero time penalties\n\n\nCons:\n-There are a couple puzzles which are very convoluted and have very little to go on\n-The music isn't the greatest and can sometimes get annoying\n-Each room can be completed in 15 minutes; from what I heard via research, IRL escape puzzles tend to count down from 45 minutes.  On average, it took me maybe 20-25 minutes per room (except for a couple where I did solve it in the 15 minutes and a couple which took longer)\n-Some of the tokens are in places which are difficult to click on\n-It can sometimes be difficult interacting with objects (mouse and keyboard), as I've struggled to get a clean circle with the mouse plenty of times\n-Speaking of interacting with objects, some tokens are hidden under chairs and the only way to get them is to manage to knock the chair over.  This involves pretty much moving the chair as quickly as possible into every wall/object in the room in hopes that it'll fall over.  It'd be nice if there was some button or ability to turn a large object on its side\n-Sometimes, the hints from the button on the wall are not relevant to the puzzle you're trying to solve, and other times are just pointing out something so stupidly obvious that it shouldn't have even been a hint (example:  one hint basically highlighted the very obvious item on the floor and had an arrow pointing to the even more obvious place where it goes)\n\n\nOverall, this is a great game for both lovers of escape the room genre puzzles and newbies looking to take a crack at it.  I feel like it's worth its $15, though some people might easily blow through the game in a few days.\nI highly suggest having some paper and a pencil/pen handy while playing (or an app open on your phone) to jot down the combinations as you slowly piece them together (particularly the ones with ciphers).  That will also help you to speedrun the chamber for the trophy later on.", "timestamp_created": 1657855064, "timestamp_updated": 1657855242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118830521": {"recommendationid": "118830521", "author": {"steamid": "76561199016727703", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 641, "last_played": 1671602687}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1657851053, "timestamp_updated": 1657851053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118826853": {"recommendationid": "118826853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208945856", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1657844195}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game to play with your S.O. or best friend for some low stakes, high fun puzzle solving!

After having played it, and seeing the amount and diversity of the content you get, I would have paid easily double the asking price, and I didn't buy it on sale.  It's basically a computerized version of an in-person escape room, complete with opening drawers, taking things off the walls, and, of course, multiplayer.  It's executed astoundingly well -- you can pick up and examine objects, both in your inventory (which has unlimited capacity, item stacking, and a self-configuring hotbar) and in the world, to turn them around, interact with them etc.  If two or more people are interacting with the same object at the same time, you can see each other's mouse cursors.   Each room has a time limit, but since it's all virtual and no one has a schedule to keep, you can keep playing after the timer runs out, and the only difference is that when you eventually do complete the puzzle, you don't get the trophy icon for it.\n\nI've only played the Omegacorp line and part of the Edgewood Mansion line, but I've thoroughly enjoyed both.  Omegacorp feels like it was made specifically for me, especially with the vintage computer references near the end.\n\nMy one gripe is that the rooms feel a bit claustrophobic, especially with the amount of objects in them and the avatar(s) of the person/people you're playing with (even though they don't have collision).  Also that I haven't figured out a way to customize my avatar yet (although there probably is one).", "timestamp_created": 1655623874, "timestamp_updated": 1655623874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117222378": {"recommendationid": "117222378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198411792864", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 484, "last_played": 1655618996}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun and its all about brainstorming, thanks to my partner, she helped me most of it <3", "timestamp_created": 1655621235, "timestamp_updated": 1655621235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117220299": {"recommendationid": "117220299", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007830676", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1664687939}, "language": "english", "review": "very good, sir", "timestamp_created": 1655617345, "timestamp_updated": 1655617345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117207333": {"recommendationid": "117207333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044204667", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 84, "playtime_at_review": 470, "last_played": 1678767303}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent fun", "timestamp_created": 1655594234, "timestamp_updated": 1655594234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117199568": {"recommendationid": "117199568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050051268", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1218, "playtime_at_review": 838, "last_played": 1678648925}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very enjoyable game.

Instead, each room is it's own self-contained puzzle. You do all the things in the room, and win when the door opens. So.. yeah.. it's an \"escape room\". Literally.\n\nBut, it just feels confined and odd like that.\n\nThe puzzles are good brain teasers, but a few get a bit obtuse with the hints. Even the hint panel that drops card hints to point you in the right direction is a bit obtuse to helping out.\n\nI've experienced a bug or two that broke a puzzle. (EG: there's a puzzle in the Egypt area with a sun, camel & scorpion that have to get positioned correctly 3x. Not sure why, but I guess I moved things around so much that it broke the puzzle when trying to get the 3rd position. I knew I was doing it right, but it wouldn't register).\n\nYou can restart a level to fix the bug, though.\n\nBut, this brings me to my biggest gripe:\n\n...No way to save progress mid-level.\n\nThe puzzle rooms are small enough you can finish them in 20 min or so... enough time for a break.\n\nBut, I started one to kill about 10 mins before a meeting at work towards end of my lunch. I made progress, and wanted to save. Nope. Sorry. No save. Exit, and then come start over again when you have time.\n\nI don't know who made that design decision, but it's annoying. I often have limited time to play games. I don't want to have to start my progress over again simply b/c I didn't have enough time to finish a level. It's the 21st century for crying out loud. Cut us some slack. Some of us have lives that interrupt us out-of-the-blue.\n\nSo, because I know I have to play a level all the way through, I only start playing this game if I have at least an hour to kill. Because I don't know how long I'll take. And I sure as heck don't want to waste time.\n\nOverall, it's good. I don't get the same feeling I get playing an escape room IRL, though. A lot of escape rooms these days are multi-room affairs where you progress. While this has sets of levels revolving around a theme and progressing you through, you don't get the same feeling as if they were all connected rooms in a single level.", "timestamp_created": 1654040658, "timestamp_updated": 1654040658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116305996": {"recommendationid": "116305996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198867018713", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2969, "last_played": 1667068082}, "language": "english", "review": "very nice", "timestamp_created": 1654031646, "timestamp_updated": 1654031646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116299012": {"recommendationid": "116299012", "author": {"steamid": "76561199206314189", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 552, "last_played": 1663026356}, "language": "english", "review": "Really you must think and use your brain i recommend this to you alot\n", "timestamp_created": 1654021530, "timestamp_updated": 1654021530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116288908": {"recommendationid": "116288908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051620650", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 951, "last_played": 1667000864}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game if you like escape rooms", "timestamp_created": 1654006926, "timestamp_updated": 1654006926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116269966": {"recommendationid": "116269966", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971104375", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1163, "last_played": 1671686643}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.

As of this writing the DLC isn't out yet, but $5 USD for it again is very reasonably priced and is definitely something I'm looking forward to. 10/10, highly recommend this game.

If the price is right, just grab it.\n\nWhy is it worth your time? The base game has several themes - each with 5 rooms. These are all well done and also include secrets to go back and find after you've solved them once.\n\nBut it's the room editor that makes this game so great. Theoretically, endless numbers of rooms can be created by other users and shared so they just keep coming! I've completed the base game - although I haven't found all the secrets yet - but I keep finding new rooms to play in the workshop. And there's a nice workshop browser included in the game so you don't have to leave the game to find a new room. They've also got sections for top rooms. I haven't tried to create a room myself, but I'm definitely looking forward to that eventually.\n\nThe game also has multiplayer, but I haven't tried that yet myself. I've shared my screen over Discord and found that works well, but the true multiplayer experience is probably a closer version of an actual escape room. I imagine it's lots of fun, but since I haven't tried it, I can't say for certain.\n\nImperfect things: Occasionally I've run into a bug or two - usually in a workshop room - but the game is very stable in my experience. The graphics are generally bright and on the simple/cartoony side so if you require grit and photo realism, you won't find it in this game. The audio is fine and the controls are reasonable, but it takes a while to get use to some of them. (Even though I play the game a couple times each week, I still forget how to do some things from time to time.)\n\nOverall, I'd say this is probably one of the best games I've played in terms of value for the money so I'd definitely recommend it if you're at all interested.", "timestamp_created": 1649091780, "timestamp_updated": 1649091780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113339920": {"recommendationid": "113339920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336919542", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 355, "last_played": 1660254742}, "language": "english", "review": "i got stuck in a room for 4 hours.. 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1649090064, "timestamp_updated": 1649090064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113335444": {"recommendationid": "113335444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028565369", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1660231684}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game to play with friends.

Haven't played all the dev levels but they're pretty well designed too with some good atmosphere as well. Love the character customizer as well but would love to see more clothes and hairstyles in the future. Community level editor and workshop is definitely gonna keep this game alive and would recommend for that feature alone.\n\nSome gripes. Community levels in coop are sometimes janky loading in with larger parties >3. The default camera can induce motion sickness but they have settings to alleviate this. Would be nice to have adjustable sprint speed since some of the community levels can be quite large and it's a bit of a slog to walk around.\n\nOverall, this is a cool game I can see coming back to over years.

I mainly played co-op with a friend so that is my main perspective.\n\nIt works well as a 2 player game, but there isn't a ton of synergy. It's more like we can each do our own thing and eventually we solve bits and pieces of a larger whole.\n\nMost of the Puzzles are excellent. They aren't too challenging nor too easy. The difficulty ramp isn't steep, but there is an increase as you progress through the game. The puzzles are also extremely creative. There are 25 main puzzles (Levels) that are divided into (5) themed based sections. If you're an average speed the levels should take 10-15 minutes.\n\nThere is probably some hidden lore to all of the puzzles, but it's not essential to know. I haven't completed it yet so I don't know whether or not there is some sort of ending. If there is great, if not it's fine.\n\nI will say that my playthrough of the game has been a bit glitchy at times. It's not horrendous, but it does create a minor annoyance from time to time. The mobility in this game is also lacking, but that's not a vital part to a puzzle game. The physics engine for the game is also rough.

The only thing really holding it back is the relatively limited amount of first party content. The room editor and workshop support could *theoretically* make up for this in spades. However, my experience has been a bit hit-or-miss.\n\nThe developers have divided their escape rooms into a handful of themed sets including an old mansion, a corporate office building, an Egyptian tomb, and even a space station. Each of these has a number of individual rooms that loosely tell a progressive story. The puzzles within do give you a good bit of challenge while still being readily solvable with all the materials they give you, though also having a system to dispense hints should you need them.\n\nThere's also *some* amount of replayability to be had with each room having eight bonus tokens hidden quite stealthily within, in addition to the puzzles for escaping the room. I still have only found a handful after a good bit of time looking around while completing the rooms. Although, that and the awards given for completing the rooms within the time limit without hints haven't really kept my attention for the long haul.\n\nIt does have both solo and cooperative play. I'd say the sweet spot there is two players at most personally. It seems like most rooms have just enough materials to keep the both of you busy on something. Having played in a group of three for most of the game, it personally felt like we often had situations where one player didn't have a heck of a lot to do because the other two were holding all the

The levels that are included in the game are very engaging and brilliantly designed.  I managed to get through all of them without cheating if you don't count slamming that hint button repeatedly on some of them, which is a testament to their intuitive design.  There is a respectable amount of these levels, but I wish there were a lot more of them.\n\n    Where the game fails is it's dependence on user-made levels.  I can see this as a fun way to make custom escape rooms for your friends.  However, when you compare the user-made rooms to the developer made ones even the highest-rated, most-downloaded rooms feel like a confusing-mess.  It's a shame the game seems to really push you to download these user-made levels too.\n\n    If the difference between $15 and $10 means nothing to you, go ahead and buy it.  Otherwise, I would wait for a sale because there is maybe 10 hours worth of developer made levels in this game and they seem to still be adding more from time to time.  As of the time of this review I have about 16 hours on record for this game.  That's about 8 hours having fun (maybe less) completing the included levels, 2 hours trying to make the user maps fun, 6 hours left the game running while I was doing other things.  hopefully, that can give you an idea of what to expect.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1647446758, "timestamp_updated": 1647446758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112266066": {"recommendationid": "112266066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025019650", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1673042966}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like room escape games, you can't go wrong with this one.

It allows players to actually remove items from your vision and then you can focus on the main tasks.

We solved every puzzle ourselves and while some of them were more obtuse than others, most of them were really great. The hidden tokens on each level also gave an extra incentive to be really in-depth with your searching. There are a whole lot of community maps for you to try, the areas are great and it was an overall great experience.\n\n[i][b][u]What I Didn't Like[/u][/b][/i]\nThere are definitely some puzzles that just don't make any sense and upon solving I remember thinking \"well that was stupid\".

I understand that it can also be played 1-player, so of course the rooms have to be designed that way. However I wish they chose to have excellent one player puzzles or excellent team puzzles instead of having just okay puzzles for both play styles.\n\n(2) For the life of me I can't understand why there are so many lock, keypad, and combination puzzles. The best real life escape rooms use zero of those kinds of puzzles for an immersive experience. Of course in real life the more creative puzzles require much more and a much bigger budget. However this is a video game! Some of the clues are fun to figure out but why is the solution something as boring as plugging in a few numbers? I wish there was more interesting ways to solve things. \n\n(3) The area is a little too small, I wish it was slightly bigger. I play with 4 other people and we're in each other's way here and there. It also feels very cramped.\n\nOverall it's a decent game and a good beginner practice if you want to try IRL escape rooms.

[b]Public escape rooms are a no go[/b] for low end users as it becomes super laggy with huge fps drops and frame skips especially when looking at certain objects in the public room. This is probably due to it being a public level that the assets (game objects) aren't as smooth as the official ones and as such, are not as bearable for a low end pc.\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nThe game really digs deep into your brain where you [b]don't need to have prior knowledge of anything[/b] but you only need to be observant, be able to differentiate between real clues and red herrings, and to be creative or have problem solving skills. Levels are categorized by their theme and there are no explanations about the levels, like the difficulty of the puzzle.\nThe other side of the coin is the gear pieces which is a side quest where in each level there are 10 pieces scattered across the room and is optional to complete. You can choose whether to scour the whole room while solving it or after you've done so (I haven't collected all pieces for a single room).\nAnother thing about the hints is that most of them [b]aren't really too helpful[/b] as the hint system is most likely to give you hints that you've already solved and thus wasting time due to the hints having a timer every time you use one (Note, I don't dislike the hints having a timer but about the hints not having a more 'written out' method of giving them out). The hints are also just a picture of what you need to do, highlighting the important parts with a red ink but some hints are not that understandable due to it just being a picture, this isn't much of a big deal though as this statement can vary from person to person where I might have hard time understanding some hints while others don't.\nBy the time I posted this review, the game only has more or less 5 sets/themes of escape room including the tutorial (each having a varied number of rooms/levels) where the latest release, as far as I know, is the Christmas one. If you wanted to have a game that has days of gameplay then this is not for you, unless you want to try solving the escape rooms made by other players. This is a [u]good 6-12 hours of gameplay[/u] that racks up your brain where you can also invite friends (they must have the game downloaded) to also suffer alongside you. Although I [b]haven't tried the coop[/b] as I am the only who owns this game in my friend group.\nI [b]haven't tried creating a room[/b] of my own as I, myself, am not a good problem creator but from all the reviews I've read, it was quite easy to use linking puzzles and stuff where you can use in-game assets to decorate your room to fit a certain them.\n[h1]THOUGHTS[/h1]\nThis is a fun game where I assure you that you would have tons of Eureka moments solving each room. Good game to play with for about 9 hours and can be a lot more fun if you have your friends with you stuck in the room.

Items (a player could hold an item that is required to decipher a puzzle and not share it with you)\n- Coop griefing - Shortcuts (in a few vanilla maps you can unlock the exit by knowing the password and since that's not randomized you can do a 3 second speedrun)\n- The official discord channel requires phone number input.\n\nConclusion:\nAs a puzzle room game this was a very pleasant experience especially if you enjoy a 1-time run through it.\nA certain feet loving shark introduced me to it.", "timestamp_created": 1645827636, "timestamp_updated": 1645827636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111011230": {"recommendationid": "111011230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195469047", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 487, "last_played": 1645371752}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice", "timestamp_created": 1645822621, "timestamp_updated": 1645822621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111006483": {"recommendationid": "111006483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872614411", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 115, "last_played": 1653344927}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Fun alternative to irl escape rooms [/h1]\n\nI love doing escape rooms, but for obvious reasons that's a bit tough to do right now.

Particles (especially moving particle physics) lag the hell out of the game, and the lack of WASD (keeping this point, although it's not true - see EDIT) camera mobility while building is extremely dated. This is the only thing holding back the game from growing, as simple commands complicit to your average 3D builder are just flat out missing or not made obvious. \n\nEDIT: There is a tutorial mode to help explain some of the controls, including WASD + RMB movement. I'm not certain why they didn't go for WASD only off the rip, but it's not too difficult to adjust to WASD + RMB. There still need to be information icons (i) next to some of the options for objects and their parameters. The tutorial explains some of the more ambiguous terms, like \"Is Sticky\". The system can still get convoluted depending on what's \"parented\" or \"child\" specifically with moving objects. It would be nice to be able to add additional animations to a single object. More complicated logic options are possible, but again very confusing to set up as you have to use empty objects rather than modify the physical object directly. \n\nEscape Simulator is a great game and may potentially be an escape room killer on the PC in terms of competition. There will always be smaller more theme/story specific puzzle games going against it, but this game offers much more potential content via the workshop. This is assuming a community grows around their in-game room builder and amasses a large enough collection of escape rooms. I would say the room building confusion is their biggest bottleneck. It's very simple in design, but deceptively tricky to add more complicated puzzles.  It's just tedious to use and be creative. The room builder UI needs clarity. They've already added specific room descriptions - something I mentioned in my first review - which suggests that they're reading and updating the game per user requests. This is good news, and shows promise for their game if they now work to make it more polished/glitchless. There are some truly well made community rooms already, and I hope to see this game grow even more with its fan made content. \n\nEscape Simulator severely relies on such content. The base game isn't as elaborate or extensive as I would prefer, but they do scratch that basic escape room itch. Asset addition will always be welcomed, and there is a good amount of unique objects already. \n\nThe multiplayer works well on average, although players should be able to join/rejoin mid match. Objects can also easily get lost, therefore soft-locking the room. Right now the game just needs some optimizing and general quality of life improvements for item interactions. It's not a game breaker, but these are points that need addressing. There is a ton of potential in this game all around, and it has already shown promise as is.

It was really fun and truly required cooperation, even though the actual puzzle were very classic/simple.\n\nThe other one was a big haunted mansion and was actually what I expected this game to be (maybe even a bit more than I would have expected). Was really funny and complete, with a story and lots of puzzles, the only issue is that it was very laggy, probably pushing the editor to its limits.\n\n\u25cb\n\nOverall this is a nice game to play with friends (maybe alone could be not so worthy), and I think it will get better with time, if more official rooms are being made and if the community gets better at building them (and maybe with a better way to rate/discover the community rooms).", "timestamp_created": 1643638662, "timestamp_updated": 1643638662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109171485": {"recommendationid": "109171485", "author": {"steamid": "76561199006686441", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1643624962}, "language": "english", "review": "All I know is if I get trapped in an Escape Room, I will die in the Escape Room.\n\nThese are hard!

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD.

Definitely worth its price. It's like playing in a real escape room. \n\nThere are features implemented that increase extremely the quality of life and make the game very easy and comfortable to be played together with other people. \n\nFor example, when someone is holding a piece of paper with a message in it and reads it, the other players can click on it as well and read it at the same time. Each player has a cursor that is displayed to all other players, so when you talk to your friends, you can also point onto the piece of paper with your cursor and your friends will see it. \nAnother example of quality of life feature is the pinging system.

More specifically, \"escape room\" style. You are in a perfectly square room with a certain theme. Each level is apart of a set of levels all with the same theme. For example, one of the first rooms is a desert theme.\n\nYou need to solve a variety of puzzles, riddles, and figure out a bunch of stuff to escape the room. There are bonuses for escaping in a certain amount of time, as well as finding hidden \"tokens\" scattered across each level.\n\nThis game was very attractive to me on the store, so it was easy for me to buy, as I'm sure it will be for many looking for a co-op puzzle game. However, despite having some pretty good ideas, there are a lot of things this game executed poorly in my eyes.\n\nNumber one are some of logistics of the levels themselves, and what I mean by this are things you have to do in order to either progress or complete the level. There are some things you just have to \"know\", there is no figuring it out. Some of these things are very annoying as well, and will leave you (after you either google it or have someone who played it before tell you) saying \"are you serious?!, how was I supposed to know that?\" once you get it. It doesn't matter how smart you are or how good you are at the puzzles, they can only be found by a simple guess or luck. For example, one of the early levels made you put something you found in a little pool of water. There is no hint, riddle, or anything within fair game of the level indicating this is what you need to do, and only by mere chance can you figure it out. \n\nTo me, this ruins some intuition of the game. I'm all for difficult puzzles and tricky riddles, but when it's something like a \"gotcha\" where you never really stand a chance, it's quite frustrating and ruins me wanting to play the game further. It's supposed to be a puzzle game, not a guessing game.\n\nSecond off is the token system. I'm not quite sure why it was added into the game, to be quite honest. It's a really annoying thing within the game because a lot of them are, like the previous statement, found by random chance or only if you are told where they are. One of them I found was because I accidentally dropped a shovel and it was revealed underneath unstable ground. If you're an achievement hunter and you need it for 100%, you are pretty much going to have to Google their locations. Again, this just ruins the fun of the game to me.\n\nLastly, and this one doesn't bother me that severely, are the fact that the levels are all the same, no matter what, even if you repeat them. All the codes are same, puzzles are the same, and the level is exactly identical. This isn't too game breaking, but if you don't beat the \"trophy\" time the first time over something you couldn't figure out, repeating the level you will beat it really quickly since you already know what to do. I was just surprised that there was no randomization of any of the puzzles or codes, or anything like that.\n\nWhile these issues are extremely frustrating, Escape Simulator is extremely fun to play, and the puzzles are a lot of fun to figure out, especially with friends.", "timestamp_created": 1641794825, "timestamp_updated": 1641795075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107714091": {"recommendationid": "107714091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022628958", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 584, "last_played": 1646768662}, "language": "english", "review": "Puzzles are fun, and interface is straighforward enough.

People complaining about dropping out of the session and watching their friends solving all puzzles, must have stupid friends. \nOf course when playing in coop you should not pick up items, but store them at a certain position in the room, so everyone can access them.\n\nI think you get the most out of the game if you play with two players, otherwise you will miss a lot of content.", "timestamp_created": 1641228391, "timestamp_updated": 1641228391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107233599": {"recommendationid": "107233599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081568376", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1897, "last_played": 1644675087}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun to play with friend even for solo.

At least it comes with Workshop support so there can possibly be an endless amount of levels given the game won't lose steam in the future. Also the devs seem to update the game from time to time; it might not be a loose estimate to expect new levels and rooms in the future from them. Since I don't have any single player experience I can't vouch for any good time on that front and on the contrary I actually think it can be a bit frustrating considering some of the puzzle mechanics present throughout the rooms.

Escape room games are one of my favorite genres as a late night party game with some friends. The demo of the game is enough to pull you in and want more as it gives a big enough insight into the game play to get you hooked. The physics and controls are phenomenal. Pine Studio put their heart and soul into mastering this puzzle game and throwing it above the others. The puzzles are quite difficult at times, but are all fantastic. The developers nailed it with the time limit setting. Fifteen minutes are given for most (if not all) of the puzzles, and this time goes quite fast. The good thing about this timer is that when it runs out nothing changes. This lack of punishment for taking it slow and easy is such a good touch. The game would be ruined if it had ended when time ran out. I played this game with one friend and that was enough to solve each puzzle quickly. There are so many puzzles that this game is really the best option when looking for an escape room simulator. The workshop compatibility for the game makes it unending and enjoyable for many many hours. Perfect game. I look forward to updates and additional levels.\n\nTL;DR: This game is the perfect multiplayer escape room to have a few drinks while playing. The rooms are incredibly detailed and almost never glitch. (only glitches being visual stuff that goes away in a second, nothing that ruins game play) The servers are fantastic and work well with more than just 2 people.

In many Escape Room games you can't even make a character and instead you're essentially a \"floating head.\" \n- While most of the graphics in the game are quite nice, there are some startling low textures on some (but not all!) carpets and other pieces of furniture.\n\nVERDICT: Escape Simulator is a fun game to play alongside friends or family (my wife is my co-op partner), and is probably the best escape room game we've come across on Steam up to this point. The developers have done everything they can to mitigate motion sickness (which is a real problem for some people, my wife included) and make the game as user-friendly as possible while giving people tools to be creative. \n\nThe only drawback I can really see to this game is that while you don't technically need other players (as specified earlier, you can play single player), Escape Simulator would feel empty or lifeless without other real people involved.

The game features several themed areas with 5 rooms a piece in that same theme. Each room will have several puzzles to solve, typically in a linear pattern, before you can escape said room. Graphically, the game looks great for what it is, and the music and sounds are very satisfying. The rooms and the puzzles themselves are challenging and will hit a niche for anyone who adores these types of mental work outs.\n\nWith workshop support and several hidden tokens to find, replayability is not at all an issue. I myself played with a friend sitting next to me as we worked to solve these rooms by ourselves, and we had an absolute ball. When she wasn't yelling at me to not brute force my way through a puzzle, of course! \n\nMy only real complaint are the controls. Using a mice and keyboard, I found it rather awkward to grab an item and shuffle it into my inventory, as well as handling items as a whole, which you will be doing a lot of. Combining items especially is something I think could use a little more polishing, but the game is playable regardless of the awkward feeling.\n\nIf you love puzzles and find the idea of an escape room appealing while your friends yell at you to turn around and check that wall one more time, than you will love Escape Simulator.

So good job & congrats on that!\n\nMy only criticism is regarding to the community-made rooms. First of all, it's amazing that it has this function, but it definitely needs improvement. It keeps crashing wheter you use an old laptop like me or a whole gamer setup like my bf.\n\nWe will definitely play again to find new tokens that were forgotten along the way, to finish the levels even faster or just for the sake of it.

Like in real rooms, you are on a timer, but you don't get kicked out when time runs out so you unlike real rooms, you can take your sweet time solving them... and you can trash the hell out of the room.\n\nIn the series of rooms we did, we didn't encounter any asinine math puzzles or weird jumps in logic.  Everything followed some kind of reasonable logic and only on some occasions did we need to use external references; either we missed the clues or you're just expected to hit Google sometimes.  For example, one puzzle required us to decipher Braille, but we couldn't find any references to it within the game so we had to actually go look it up.  This is a no-no in real rooms, so while I allow that we totally missed something, there shouldn't be any reason to use resources outside of the room to solve a puzzle.  Some puzzles are pretty tough, but don't require you to somehow discover the theory of relativity while standing on your head trying to keep your pants down by your ankles.  True story, I swear.\n\nThe game comes with (at the time of this writing) four series of themed rooms.  I can't say if they tell any kind of narrative, but the one we worked on didn't seem to have any.  Either way, a series is a handful of six or seven rooms (too lazy to check) that are filled with puzzles and hidden items to discover in order to work your way out the exit.  It works very well in co-op, but can be tackled in single player since the timer really has no bearing on whether or not you can get out.  The rooms are tiny, though, and lack some of the sense of adventure you might get in a real room.  However, getting to do more than one room in a series makes up for each room's relatively tiny size.\n\nOn a technical level, the game is mostly solid with some squishy bits.  We encountered a pretty big bug that made a puzzle unsolvable, but it only affected one player.  The other players did not see the visual gaffe so they were able to solve it while the other player sat out.  Argument for co-op I guess.  Everything else works pretty well and the physics don't feel out of place even though they have little to no bearing on solving the puzzles.\n\nOn the plus side, the game comes with a room editor and you have access to community-made rooms from the workshop, so if you really like escape rooms and can trust that the community doesn't stink (it doesn't), there's a lot of longevity baked into the engine which is very nice.  Some nice-to-haves would be larger room sizes and more character customization options, but none of those are dealbreakers.\n\nOverall, Escape Room Simulator does what it sets out to do and does it well.  With the community adding content via the workshop, there's plenty of fun to be had here, especially if you get together with some friends to tackle the rooms.  However, you can fly solo if you want to and still succeed, though perhaps getting through in time will be a challenge.  Fun, inexpensive, and well-made.", "timestamp_created": 1639497944, "timestamp_updated": 1639497944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105821050": {"recommendationid": "105821050", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979292993", "num_games_owned": 569, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 1431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 470, "last_played": 1669801059}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, really hope community grows and utilizes the built in mapmaker to its fullest", "timestamp_created": 1639494391, "timestamp_updated": 1639494391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105818984": {"recommendationid": "105818984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008755302", "num_games_owned": 1599, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1659650274}, "language": "english", "review": "Very impressive game, especially the Community created rooms.

The target player base for escape room games are puzzle heads.

The more elaborate the better.\n\nEnter \"Escape Simulator\", with simple aesthetics, minimal story-telling and atmosphere, the puzzles and Steam Workshop are where it truly shines. Great puzzles through the entire main campaign with just the right amount of cerebral juggle and pure satisfaction. Go to Rusty Lake for the story, come to Escape Simulator purely for non-stop puzzles and community content.\n\nI hope this game keeps growing and that the devs will eventually release the complex logic modules from the main campaign for the room editor. Pipe dreams, towers of Hanoi, and weight counterbalance puzzles... so much potential not yet available for custom building.

This had led me to feel like I have to ration the game a bit, because although I would like to try to solo it and complete all the rooms, it would spoil the experience if I wanted to play with my friends later on. That's probably the worst part about this game. Meanwhile, the tokens are sort of like a side quest and you need to collect all of them (I've generally seen most rooms have a total of 8 from my experience so far). I'm not sure how the devs can address this, most IRL Escape Rooms have seasonal rooms and generally swap it out to keep it fresh and to keep clientele coming back. They could probably add more RNG to some of the problems/puzzles so it deters people from remembering the answers when they revisit the room.\n\n\u2022 The motion controls are very...floaty, and for the first time in several decades -- I feel nauseous playing video games. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun and engaging, but there are times I feel super nauseous with how the controls are in regards to looking around. It's too \"floaty\" for me, they should allow you the option to configure this motion to suit your needs.\n\n\u2022 There have been some occasions where there's nothing you can really do when you are playing with multiple people, because your teammates are already handling all of the objectives. There are occasions where there is only two objectives at any given time, and if you play with a group of 3, that third person will essentially feel dejected from all of the activities and get bored quickly. If this game is to support multiplayer, I think they may want to look at making sure there's enough things to do for everyone possibly at all given times. Create a diagram/workflow chart of the objectives. Is the map scalable whether you play solo or with teams? If the map doesn't scale and was configured for solo, then obviously a multiplayer team will flip it quickly, and I'm not sure if simply reducing the alotted time to complete it is merely a good fix. \n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\n\u2022 Despite my fairly detailed list of Con's for the game, I generally would recommend this purchase because of how original it is coming into a pretty congested video game environment.

Once you've completed a level, aside from getting all 8 tokens, there's little reason to repeat (since you already know the solution).\n\nIf you love puzzle games, and like the idea of community made content, it's well worth the price.

The graphics are crisp, clean, and colorful. Puzzle interaction is slick and simple most of the time. The biggest pro as you might have guessed is two-fold; playing with a friend and community-generated rooms. There's also an editor in case you're feeling particularly ambitious and want to contribute your own rooms.\n\nThe puzzles are typically straight-forward. I wouldn't say any of them were particularly obscure or abstract, but occasionally you'll find yourself revisiting multiple resources in the room because you feel like you missed something. On one puzzle there was a chest that required a key, which we couldn't find. It turns out the key was just sitting on the ground and we have no idea where it came from.\n\nI strongly recommend treating these rooms as real-life environments when it comes to inventory management; you'll want to find items and place them in a central location. Yes, there are bubbles around characters to show a vague representation of what they're carrying, and yes you can view an object simultaneously, but it's easy with all the random items in the room to get overwhelmed and the discussion becomes \"ok, tell me exactly what you have.\" As I said, there are a lot of red herrings as well. The developers clearly wanted to make the room as interactive as possible, which means you can pick up just about everything including trash. There is a trash can/bin on the ground in each room so you can clear the space, but the rooms are very small and that process is tedious at best. Not really a complaint, just something to be prepared to deal with.\n\nEither way, it's a great experience especially if you've got someone to play with. There are quite a few rooms shipped with the core game, and the community seems to be creating some pretty clever ones (including a high-ranked horror-type room). Hopefully this trend will continue and this game will become the goto for any room escape enthusiasts.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1638673993, "timestamp_updated": 1638673993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547014415264129639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105256621": {"recommendationid": "105256621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130340274", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "playtime_at_review": 887, "last_played": 1678383034}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy it.

In the majority of the rooms the puzzles are easy to figure out but there are some that are quite hard on the later lvls. The main difficulty comes from finding everything you need to solve the puzzles. Early on every time i was stuck on a puzzle it was because i was lacking information. So dont go in here expecting baba is you lvl of difficulty on puzzles but expect a little more than the room games or the nonary series. Also i have to give props to the devs because in the majority of escape room games up until now you couldnt interact with everything but here you can, giving you much more freedom to lose your self in it.\n\nA few negative things i have to say about the game are these. The timer imo is useless and kinda ruins it for me, i get that real escape rooms have one but i dont see the point in this especially if you can go back into the room and solve it within the time limit to get the achievment. I wish there was a different system in place but this is not a big deal. My main issues are these, first the hint system is completly useless imo, for example i was stuck on an office lvl since i havent noticed a detail in one of the items, i use the first hint and i get something that i already did, ok i wait for the timer then get the second hint, which is basicly a number that you get from doing the thing they suggested in the first hint. At that point i just said fuck it happene to notice the item. I just wish that hints were a bit cryptic in a different format but that is hard to do, for example i had missed a tree, instead of giving tips on things i already did tell me that i missed something if you saw that i havent interacted with that item at all.\n\nOne last thing i have to say about this game is that it has a lvl editor and workshop integration so you can expect to get some cool community lvls in the future.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1638467203, "timestamp_updated": 1638467203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105080355": {"recommendationid": "105080355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001687783", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1208, "last_played": 1666835933}, "language": "english", "review": "You buy it once and get endless new content with how popular and fun making rooms is in the Workshop.

This first-person game takes you through 15 or so pre-made levels (with more on the way) where you can interact with objects, examine them, and put clues together to\u2026well, escape the room. Puzzles can range from a minor challenge to insane difficulty. The game can be played fully co-op, which I would highly recommend over single player. And the best feature by far is a built-in level editor with Steam Workshop functionality for custom escape rooms made by the community. Other than some minor gripes, this game is a must-have for people looking for a new game to play together.\n\n[i]Disclaimer: The game was played on my main account, so this doesn't have my accurate in-game time.[/i]\n\n[b][u]BREAKDOWN (Grading Key at the bottom):[/u][/b]\n\n[b][u]Graphics - B:[/u][/b]\nThe graphics in the game has been developed with a non-realistic, cartoon look. The cartoon style fits it quite well though as the colors are vibrant, distinct, and pop out. This plays well with the different themes they have for the levels and adds to the atmosphere. My biggest issue with the graphics is probably the character design. Being able to customize your character a bit adds some personal touches to each person, but it can be quite jarring. For example, one of my friends made his character\u2019s skin bright red and while looking around the room, the character, who looks like the embodiment of a Hot Tamale, seemed to be staring at me and it hurt my eyes to look at him. Other than that, the skybox and far away textures on some models were not as detailed as the models in front of you. While that doesn\u2019t matter nearly as much in enclosed rooms, the outside levels were affected by it. All in all, I wouldn\u2019t say this was a dealbreaker.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay - A-:[/u][/b]\nNow here is where things get very good. This game does an excellent job of implementing interactive puzzles that you really have to think about, which is the main goal of an escape room. Being plopped into a level with 15 minutes on the clock (finishing in 15 minutes gives an achievement, does not kick you from the level), you and whomever you are playing with must decipher clues from the environment around you and interact with objects to put the pieces together to escape. The ways of interacting with objects are varied and can range from putting certain objects in the correct holes, glossing over the object to decipher symbols and codes, and even pressing buttons or inserting keys into individual objects to unlock an object inside. You can also pick up and hold multiple objects in your inventory, scroll through them, inspect them from your inventory, and chuck them across the room. The puzzles on each of these levels are varied and interesting, even if some of them are near impossible to solve. The rooms in this game are also not randomized, so going into an old one will have those same puzzles. If you reach those impossible puzzles or just have trouble, the game offers a hint system where at the press of a button, a picture with a hint will pop out. The hint system is a little bit behind though, as it doesn\u2019t follow your progress and will give you hints to earlier or completely different puzzles. The Egypt group of pre-made levels has been my favorite so far as it felt so unique and rewarding to figure out the puzzles that stumped me at first. Can proudly say that I used no hints in that group and it felt the best to play of all the levels included in the game.\n\n[b][u]Replayability B+:[/u][/b]\nI am sure you are wondering why I scored replayability so high when rooms are not randomized. Each level has about 8 hidden tokens for you to find and you can go back to look at where they are placed, but that isn\u2019t the reason to come back. The best feature of this game is the built-in level editor and Steam Workshop integration. This means the community can create full escape room scenarios from scratch and upload them for others to play. The best level I have played in this game was a community-made one called \u201cThe Miniature Escape\u201d which puts you and a friend in separate rooms where you must describe and work together to solve puzzles on each side of the room. This room/level was one of the best I played in the entire game as it was incredibly unique, well-crafted, and has an emphasis on communication to solve its challenging puzzles. Currently, there are 740+ rooms currently that have been made so far and about 10+ are being added every day. At this rate, there are more than enough community rooms to keep you coming back, along with the ability to create your own for friends, family, or yourself if you get amnesia or forget very easily.\n\n[b][u]Multiplayer A+:[/u][/b]\nThis game is probably one of the greatest co-op experiences I have played in recent years, which is great that the entirety of the game can be played in co-op. Since the game is about solving intricate puzzles, communicating and deciphering together are key components of your co-op playthrough and will be integral to solving the tasks at hand. I would say the optimal group is around 2-3 people, but apparently the game can hold a lot more. I don\u2019t remember the last time I had such joy in discussing a piece of paper with my friends and figuring out how the symbols on the page, which correlated with numbers, were added together and in what order. There is also full player clipping, meaning you can walk through your friends\u2019 characters, which is essential in a closed space like a room. Though beware, it could get frustrating if you are solving a puzzle and your friend walks over and stands in front of you, blocking your view of the actual puzzle...I\u2019M TALKING ABOUT YOU, CANDYLORD. It is also nice to throw objects at your friends. Even though it clips through them and doesn\u2019t hurt them at all, you can pretend it actually hit them and there's some joy in that.\n\n[b][u]Sound B-:[/u][/b]\nFor the record, I am not a sound guy. I do not claim to be one that investigates sound deeply, so please take this with a grain of salt. My biggest gripe is the music. I am not a fan of the loud overlaying music that are on the stages. After trying the tutorial and Egypt level, turning down the music was a must for me. For what it is worth, the sounds of the objects work and get the job done without taking you out of the experience, but that music will be something I leave off no matter what.\n\n[b][u]Developers B+:[/u][/b]\nI can\u2019t say I have been following the developers or this game for a long time, but I can say from my research, they are fantastic. Not only have they made one of the best speedrunning games out there, \u201cSEUM\u201d, which I played on my friends account but still haven\u2019t bought myself and that needs to change. They have also shown themselves to be willing to accept criticism and understanding of the community's feelings on the game, which is a must. A game\u2019s community is its lifeblood nowadays, so respecting and listening to your community is a very important aspect of game development due to the nature of how games are made now. I believe this developer cares about the community and the enjoyment of the game to them, not just the profits that could be made from it. On top of that, they have plans to add more rooms and have just added some Halloween-themed assets to build your own levels with, as well as a build-a-room competition where the winner got $1,000. So far, I am pleased with the developers.\n\n\nThis was my first in-depth review and I hope you guys thought of it as a good read!

The official rooms are quite nice, and there's a good few decisions made by the devs that just make the game a lot nicer to play. Some of those features include:\n\n[list]\n[*] An endless inventory, so every item that you can pick up and hold can get put in a hotbar-like inventory that you can scroll through.\n[*] The ability to pin items, so you can continue looking around and interacting with stuff while still being able to see the contents of a note or a book that has vital information.\n[*] The hint machine, a little gadget on the wall of each room that will spit out a small piece of paper with a clue, usually being vague enough to help you figure something out, rather than just telling you how to do it.\n[*] A trash can where you can put unnecessary clutter, like broken pieces of vases or items you no longer need. Since you can pull items out of the trash can like it's a storage chest, me and my friend sometimes treated it like a spot for safe keeping, making sure we wouldn't lose or misplace certain important items.\n[*] In multiplayer, you can inspect an item in someone else's hand, and they'll be able to see your cursor, so you can all look at a book or a note together and stay on the same page without having to pass the object around to everyone.\n[/list]\n\nThere's currently 3 main areas with 5 rooms each (Plus a 4th set of 5 rooms being released one at a time), and they all have a 15 minute \"par time\", where if you finish before the time runs out, you get a shiny medal to show for it. This absolutely doesn't mean that all the rooms are that easy to complete upon your first time seeing them, so unless you're playing with multiple people, or you have some good escape room skills, the game isn't gonna take just 4 hours to complete.\n\nThe community has been doing an amazing job of making some incredible puzzles as well, thanks to the level editor being quite easy to use, compared to some other games. I haven't gotten around to playing a whole lot of the community levels quite yet, and while there is a fair share of lower quality stuff, there's some real amazing submissions like Edgar Allen Poe Creepy Stories, which is actually not just a single room, but a collection of rooms all based off the works of Edgar Allen Poe accessible by one main hub. The room themed after The Raven took me and a friend close to 30 minutes to work through it, and only have to turn to the built-in tip system.\n\nReally the only nitpicks I have with the game come in the form of custom levels and the level editor. While there's a lot you can do with a little bit of elbow grease and doing the Logic Object equivalent of spaghetti code, there's some things that exist in the official rooms, which you can't quite do in custom levels. I'll spoiler these in case you want to keep the surprise of some mechanics a secret.\n\n[list]\n[*] In the first level set, there's a [spoiler]big beam of reflected light that you control by moving certain levers[/spoiler]. As far as I'm aware, there's no way to recreate this kind of control in the level editor.\n[*] In the second level set, there's a [spoiler]blowtorch that you turn on and use to cut an opening to a ventilation shaft[/spoiler]. There's ways to get around this and accomplish a similar effect, but you can't get that same level of precision in a custom level.\n[*] In the same level as the last point, you have a [spoiler]remote control for some little roombas that you can drive around[/spoiler]. Once again, there's no way to recreate this in a custom level.\n[*] In the last level set, you need to [spoiler]utilize a zoetrope (Very cool object, look it up if you haven't seen one!)[/spoiler]. There's no way to recreate this object or this effect in a custom level.\n[/list]\n\nI'm not sure if the devs plan to give creators the power to do these things in custom levels, but it does suck a little to know that those are possible things in the game, yet we don't have access to them. I understand how difficult it would be to get some of those working to the level that the community would likely want them, but apart from more official rooms with more great puzzles (of course), being able to use those features are my biggest wishes for this game.", "timestamp_created": 1637793921, "timestamp_updated": 1638156302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103563459": {"recommendationid": "103563459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109298230", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1660063354}, "language": "english", "review": "simple yet fun", "timestamp_created": 1637793786, "timestamp_updated": 1637793786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103563186": {"recommendationid": "103563186", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966486976", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 545, "last_played": 1665774728}, "language": "english", "review": "My love for this game is completely unhealthy and dominates my computer life when rooms become available to the point where I am falling asleep at my desk playing (Disregard I have only played for 9 hours, the replay-ability even after a few months is there).

You can still finish once time is up. And I cannot stress this enough, that there have been ZERO glitches with this game. \nThe controls are very intuitive for what you are trying to accomplish. The graphics are simple, and based upon the difficulty of the tasks, I am glad this is the case. Complicated rendering of environments would hinder moving objects and simple observing needed to find items and clues in the rooms. \nThis is a delicate puzzle solving game. The environments have nooks and crannies that may have the clues you are looking for to open the lock you've been trying to open for the past 5 mins.

If you're into puzzles you'll definitely love this game. It's especially fun to play through it with a buddy (which is what I did), But I imagine alone would be just as good. Though it's pretty short with the timer for each room averaging around 13 minutes, there are some pretty challenging ones that took us quite a while to beat. There's about 15 in all as of writing this, but the Devs are already cranking that number to 20 week by week with a new room theme. \nHowever, thought the total playtime is only about 4 hours (Or less if you're not dumb like me), the thing that makes the game more \"meaty\" is the emphasis on the steam workshop, allowing players to make their own levels and rooms. In a game where you can really only play the main rooms one time, this is a necessity and they pull it off incredibly well. There's already a crazy amount of well made rooms and hopefully that number continues to grow cause I'm having a blast going through them. People are doing some awesome stuff with the tools given. So far I haven't run into any bugs (though I've heard people having issues in workshop rooms) and for its art style, the game looks fantastic. \nFor the listed price, there's really no complaints.

The rooms are all just enough of a challenge without being so hard I want to give up.  The tokens make each room re-playable.  I've played solo and I've teamed up with the friend who introduced me to escape rooms.  Both ways are enjoyable and if I'm having trouble with a puzzle, teaming up is a surefire way to work through it.  I love that there are community designed rooms, though I haven't had a chance to play those yet.  Something to look forward to.  I liked the fact that I could demo the game to see if I liked it (and that co-op mode worked in the demo).  The demo was just enough of a taste that I was sold on it.\n\nAs for things that I don't like... I usually have to start the game, close it and restart it because it's always glitchy the first time it loads up.  That may be due to my PC, though.  We haven't had to use many hints, but when we did they were a mix of helpful and not really helpful at all (and the community rooms don't have them).\n\nI don't play a lot of video games because they are hard on my hands, but this is one I can definitely play.  If you enjoy puzzles, mind games, and real-life escape rooms, you should definitely try out the free demo to see if this is something you'll enjoy.\n\nMy initial review (above) was afetr playing 12.3 hours.  I have now played an additional 130.  I've played all the Pine rooms as well as 70+ community rooms, and I love them all.  There are amazing room builders in this community, designing excellent and intriguing rooms for us to play.  I did try building a room early on, but had some trouble and gave up.  I'd like to give it another try in the future.\n\nStill totally recommend Escape Simulator to anyone who enjoys puzzle games and in-person escape rooms.", "timestamp_created": 1636163934, "timestamp_updated": 1670103195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102291544": {"recommendationid": "102291544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074389935", "num_games_owned": 1075, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1639425853}, "language": "english", "review": "Escape rooms are an incredibly fun activity which is even better with friends and it's honestly a wonder why a game like this didn't already exist.

I have to say they really could've done better when making the workshop for this game as it looks pretty limited, if they just let people add whatever they want, then rooms from the workshop may be more spectacular than they are now. One example would be ktane (keep talking and nobody explodes), a game where you have to defuse a bomb by having someone else tell you instructions for solving various modules. It didn't do so well at first, with there being only 14 modules that were kinda boring as time went on, but once they opened up their workshop, that drove people to make some super cool modules!
