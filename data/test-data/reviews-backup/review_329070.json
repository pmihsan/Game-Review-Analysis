Make the levels bigger with more options to be the spy master. Also, like in the game James Bond Nightfire,  you can take pictures of the potential spies in the game, as in this game, you have a list of people at the bottom of your screen,  etc. As said, this game is an alright game, and maybe the developers of games see reviews here on steam, and of they do, heres hoping the take some thoughts of working on this game more, b/c I do see potential here, just not quite yet.

Because of that, they made it two player only and filled the rest with bots. Problem solved right? Not really. This is a behavior simulator, and now one player isn't trying to behave like he's a normal every day person. He's trying to behave like he's a normal every day bot, because the bots can't do much better. It's unnatural, and doesn't really fit with the theme of the game.\n\nThe problem is with the underlying premise of the game. If they could improve the game play for the other dozen or so innocent actors and give them something else to do, something else to accomplish, then maybe this game could have more than 2 players and feel much better than it is. Until then, it's not going to achieve anything near the level of intrigue of Town of Salem, or anything similar.\n\nI hope the developers take this to heart, and find some direction to improve this.", "timestamp_created": 1670127557, "timestamp_updated": 1670127557, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482752829790115356", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127620551": {"recommendationid": "127620551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198956918457", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1453, "last_played": 1664707039}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0430\u043b\u044c \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442", "timestamp_created": 1669802776, "timestamp_updated": 1669802776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595416605472564697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127596483": {"recommendationid": "127596483", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992813100", "num_games_owned": 490, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 495, "last_played": 1666030571}, "language": "french", "review": "Dead Game, abandonned in the middle of developement, don t buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1669765653, "timestamp_updated": 1669765653, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127483625": {"recommendationid": "127483625", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993486260", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 894, "last_played": 1669489292}, "language": "english", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1669687934, "timestamp_updated": 1669687934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127353371": {"recommendationid": "127353371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014296958", "num_games_owned": 2176, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 638, "last_played": 1669622848}, "language": "english", "review": "[u]Positives:[/u]\nGame is a lot of fun, especially if you have friends to play with.\n\n[u]Negatives:[/u]\nSadly the community is dead, you're lucky to find more than 10+ people online on public servers.

In other words, the graphics are \"cartoony\". The biggest advantage of this graphic is the minimum PC requirements. I'd say it'll run on Windows XP, or my grandfather's computer. You should be able to run it at a playable FPS.\n\nThe gameplay is fricking fun and it's even more fun with a friend. One of you is a Spy and the other is a Sniper. The Spy needs to complete all or some of the missions within a time limit, which can be increased. The Sniper must control any mistakes made by the Spy and be aware of his surroundings.\n\nAudio is no longer a miracle at all. The game only features Ambience sounds, and the sounds of the Spy when he tries to do something with the Double Agent. In short, there's no audiorgasm to be found here.\n\nThe difficulty of this game is supernaturally hard. It may look like a walk in the park in the videos, but the opposite is true. You need to come up with clever tactics for the Spy, or fool the Spy as the Sniper.\n\nGrind is more or less zero.\n\nEach game usually lasts under 5 minutes.\n\nThe price is extremely high for me. After all, the game is a bit dead. So it's good to have a friend who will get the game, or has already gotten it.\n\n\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc0b \ud835\udc09\ud835\udc14\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc06\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc13:\nSpyParty is a great game. Like a really great game. I hope Chris will continue his SpyParty project. There are no more updates in the game.

The game is over asking price with no ability to \"invite\" a friend using only one copy of the game, meaning that you are forced to get \"two\" copies of the game to be able to play with another person. The developer has mentioned that an implementation of \"copies\" have been in development for over 4 years but has yet to be integrated. \n\nThe other reason why the developer hasn't lowered the price after so many years is due to the game \"not ready for an influx of players\" which I find quite ridiculous since the player base has been declining and no more than 6-18 players are active at a time. \n\nI ONLY RECOMMEND this game if it was affordable at a price point of 10$-15$ MAX for an indie game but other than that I would hold off until maybe 2032? if and when the developer decides to reduce the price.\n\nGraphics: 2 out of 10 | SIMS 2001 Graphics\nFun: 9 out of 10 | Very good 1v1 for newcomers but pros at this game will ruin the fun\nLearning curve: 3 out of 10 | Mechanics are easy and even my cat learn how to play\nPrice: 0 out of 10 | Not affordable for many especially foreign countries where the US dollar outweighs their currency.\n\nOverall: It's an okay game but not a must have. Replayability is there for those who want a quick game (around 2-5 minutes) but not much more in terms of updates, poor dev support, overpriced. \n\nP.S: If you're the dev reading this.

An infinitely replayable and deep 1v1 game of strategy, bluff, memory, deception and skill where the experience of playing versus an opponent is an ever shifting and evolving meta beyond any RTS or strategy game I've played, based on trying to outwit your opponent and stay ahead and subvert their expectations of you. \n\nThere's literally nothing quite like it. I find some of the negative reviews this game gets to be unfair, or at least misleading, and will attempt to explain why I feel this way. Though its clear that for this game to be 'for you' may have a few criteria, mainly that you're either interested in diving into the discord community and competitive scene, or you're willing to gift it to a friend or convince them to buy, and you're confident you'll have plenty of opportunities to play with them.\n\nCommon negative reviews and comments on forums are: \n\n1) its too expensive. The developers say this is specifically to discourage too large an influx of players until they feel its ready. I'm sceptical this is needed personally, but regardless, this is a game that, if its for you and you have someone to play with, could easily net you thousands of hours of fun. For hours per dollar that ain't half bad. The value estimation of this game often gets attributed to the amount of 'content' or how 'simple' the premise is, which doesn't really tell the whole story with the game's potential, since its depth and amount of content comes as much from your opponent as it does the mechanics or maps.\n\n2) No updates in a long while. I've heard covid has hampered development, and it has been a long while since the last update, however its clear from their discord the devs are still active and invested in the game. But regardless, as much as I'd like to see more content, its like bemoaning chess doesn't have enough content, enough differently designed boards, new pieces and new mechanics. What they have already is a pretty much infinitely playable competitive game that's as complicated and has enough content that it needs to. It is in my view far and above enough content for you and a friend to play for many years to come, both improving and learning each others game, the skill ceiling is in the stratosphere and in some respects having too much new content would risk breaking the competitive perfection of design.\n\nLike adding a new chess piece into the game of chess, more content in terms of mechanics is not necessarily a good thing, and certainly not a deal breaker. That's not to say new maps wouldn't be great, but there's a good sized collection already I can't imagine myself tiring of, and in some ways appreciate that my improving at the game can be focused to a non intimidating but solid collection of maps. There may be bugs here and there but the game seems well balanced and solid enough in terms of polish for the most part.\n\nIt's also an experience you literally can't get anywhere else, and paying a bit of a  premium for something so utterly unique is ok by me.\n\n3) Low player count. This could potentially be a problem, if you don't have at least one friend to play with and you'd both be willing to commit to playing it regularly. There's a pretty cool, friendly, inviting and vibrant discord community and competitive scene, so there are ways to easily find games, but just logging into the lobby is probably going to leave you waiting to get into matches a bit too often. If you have a friend to play with, however, this could be something you both continue to play and enjoy for a decade and there'll likely never come a point where you think you've gotten as good as you can be, and will be a constant neverending shift in the meta as you both try and work against your opponent's knowledge of your strategies and habits to try and get the upper hand. Even with a set amount of mechanics or maps, the landscape of your games against each other will change constantly and you'll never be in a rut otherwise you'll be losing.\n\nIf you have someone to play with, and are not relying on randoms on the internet to play -- or are interested into getting into the competitive scene, then this game is a rich enough 1v1 PVP experience with such a great amount of strategy and skill to develop to keep you invested in playing matches for many years.

Running into the same handful of People everytime limits you from seeing different playstyles and learning from them. \n\nIt is disappointing seeing a game with a huge potential like this go unseen. This is hardly a Game you can just pick up and play. Mostly because of its pricing its hard to get more people to play it.

I thought that I'd have to convince a friend to get this game too, so that was a very pleasant surprise.\n\nThis game has a detailed but easy to follow tutorial.\n\nI'm still a total noob at this game, but I have to say, I find playing as the spy far more enjoyable than playing as the sniper. As the spy, I feel mischievous and it's more entertaining to me to outsmart the sniper. When playing as the sniper, you've got to use your knowledge of being a spy to find any way to catch them out, and perhaps that means the best snipers will always beat the best spies. Maybe the game is perfectly balanced, though. I'm still new. Playing as the sniper is a challenge, and it is rewarding when you see something and the penny drops.\n\nYes...well done \ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffb", "timestamp_created": 1641468170,

It's unique, it's fun, and it's a great social deduction experience for two people. It's not too simple, it's not too complex, and the rounds tend to last just long enough. Based on the gameplay alone, I would wholeheartedly recommend SpyParty. \n\nSo why do I not recommend this game? First, a brief bit of context: a friend of mine showed me this game years ago, around 2013. So I bought it, way back in the beta, and the two of us played it regularly and had a blast. That friend moved away around 2015 and we lost contact. \n\nWhy am I telling you this? Well, guess what I haven't been able to do ever since my friend moved away in 2015? Play SpyParty. My played time speaks for itself. In the past 6 years, I have managed to play TWO ROUNDS of SpyParty (both on the same day). \n\nThere's just straight up not enough people to play with. And the reason there's no one to play with is pretty obvious, and people have been saying it in reviews ever since the game was first brought to Steam: This game is just too damn expensive for what it is. You're paying $25 for a game with 16 peak players in the past month. $25 for a game, that if you want to play with your friends, will cost [i]them[/i] $25. This game has never gone on sale. There's no kind of deal for buying more than one copy. It's never included in any promotions. Nothing. And it's not even because the developer abandoned the game! They posted an update on the game 11 hours before I made this review.\n\nSpyParty is one of the biggest missed opportunities I've ever seen in gaming. This game has the potential to be insanely popular, but the $25 cost per person just completely cripples the game. You simply cannot gate off a social deduction game like this and expect it to succeed. It just does not work. It [i]astounds[/i] me the amount of potential that is just being left on the table here, solely because the developer insists on charging $25 for a game that's been in beta for nearly a decade.\n\nSo should you spend $25 on SpyParty? Depends. If you have a friend that's willing to also spend $25 on a copy and play with you, the game's a blast! But if you're looking to buy a single copy of this game, and play by yourself, don't bother. There is no one online to play with you.", "timestamp_created": 1631202182, "timestamp_updated": 1631202182, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 184, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.893636226654052734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99038850": {"recommendationid": "99038850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184151327", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 72, "last_played": 1631491039}, "language": "english", "review": "Wheels", "timestamp_created": 1631175368, "timestamp_updated": 1631175368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674132704734802246", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98956337": {"recommendationid": "98956337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286170638", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1655004479}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "sd", "timestamp_created": 1631047885, "timestamp_updated": 1631047885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499180376529693604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98843803": {"recommendationid": "98843803", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980727490", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 167, "last_played": 1644774712}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this with my gf.

It is essentially multiplayer only but has an almost non-existent playerbase. Expect to wait upwards of an hour for a game. The only ~10-20 active players that actually play this game have their own discord server that they have to post in to find games. Ontop of this, there is no actual lobby/searching system, you have to just invite people to play.\n\nThis is entirely a casual game of the like of among us with extremely little content, as the vast majority claim it should be much cheaper, it is comparable to a \u00a35 game, not a \u00a320 game. It does not have anywhere near the content or depth to justify this pricetag.\n\nDespite what the dev and the extremely small playerbase claim, there is no competive depth, at all, to this game. As the playerbase is extremely small with no matchmaking, the people I have played against have hundreds of hours in this game, while I have around 10 minutes (the playtime of 4 hours is almost entirely waiting for games), despite this I have won more games than I have lost. On top of this I have spectated 'top' players of this game from the sniper side and manage to quite often tell (with certainty) who the spy is before they do. This should make it incredibly obvious how little depth this game actually has. Imagine if someone who had played 10 minutes of chess could spot a forced mate before Magnus Carlsen (the reality is it's even worse than that, as the person actually playing has more tools available to them than the person just spectating, it's more compable to someone that had played 10 minutes of chess spotting a forced mate before Magnus Carlsen while also only being able to see half the pieces), or someone that had played 10 minutes of chess winning games more often than losing when playing against people with hundreds of hours.\n\nFinally, this game is NOT early access, no matter what is claimed. It has been public for a decade (well before the steam early access), and there is no actual updates to it. The last update to it that was anything other than a bugfix was almost 2 years ago, and it was just a small map. There has not been a single major update to it since it came to steam early access 3 years ago. It is clear this game will always be in the very poor alpha state it is in. That a multiplayer only game has been public for over a decade and still does not have as much as a search for game function is preposterous.\n\nSave your money.", "timestamp_created": 1617057441, "timestamp_updated": 1617057441, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596652805805206299", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1617064300, "developer_response": "Hi, I'm sorry you had trouble finding matches, it seems like you had worse luck there than most, but the community is small so if you're playing off-peak it can take a bit of time to find games, and I won't try to change your mind about the game, but I do need to correct a couple things in this post for folks who might be reading.  First, the idea that there have been no major updates in 2 years is incorrect, and I'd encourage anybody who is wondering about this to check the steam dev logs...for example, the Daily Challenge, which you played, was from a new update last year and had multiple changes during the year.  I'm definitely slower at updating than I'd like, but you can see the significant changes in the game over the years if you look at the updates and especially if you go back to the blog.  The second thing I wanted to address is the claim that there's no depth.

It's just a lobby and you have to invite people to play against you, usually it's just empty anyway. so good luck getting a game.\nthen the biggest problem is that the whole community just loves to rope for god knows why. it's so unbearable. the players who will play you in the game will want to play you in a round, and then watch an entire replay of the whole round to analyze it before playing the next round. they'll even do it in tournament, which is just preposterous. In no other competition in the entire world is it normal for the competitors to sit and watch a replay of the round they just played before continuing to the next round. it's just bizarre, and what's the justification for it, that the game is complex?? Just imagine if a chess professional asked his opponent to wait in tournament, while he goes back and analyzes the match they just played before starting the next.\nthis is a really sad review, because the game itself is actually a 10/10. but its a competitive game and it's really not for casuals, but for some reason the dev is intent on selling the game to casuals. in reality the game just ends up shoving away all the casuals and then most people who would tryhard the game don't even get to find out that it's a complex game because the dev just wants to cater to casuals, for some reason. i swear the dev for this game literally doesn't want to make money or something, it's like a passion project or something. \nif you are a competitive player and like complex games, and don't mind having your face roped off, this is the game for you. I'm absolutely still gonna tune into the streams of the tournament matches, because when you are watching instead of playing they skip ahead and you aren't getting roped. The production quality is amazing for such a small community and the level of play at the top is really spectacular. i highly recommend tuning into spypartyfans, look it up on youtube or twitch. it's sad, because this game could be so much more popular than it is, but there are systems in place to prevent that from happening.", "timestamp_created": 1610919731, "timestamp_updated": 1610919731, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552732229232788086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84816812": {"recommendationid": "84816812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128335803", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 355, "last_played": 1663989256}, "language": "english", "review": "thumbs up\n", "timestamp_created": 1610837818, "timestamp_updated": 1610837818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84790704": {"recommendationid": "84790704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342834323", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1610806278}, "language": "english", "review": "have fun in the practice mode for 10 minutes before you refund this\n\nthis game has no players, probably because of the steep price tag. it hasnt gotten any updates in forever either, so it really isn't worth your money. don't wait for a sale either, there have been like 5 since i wishlisted it in october and it has been in 0 of them.\n\nif you want to buy it, go ahead\n\nif you want to play it, prepare to shell out 50 bucks or more so a friend can play it, and be prepared for them to stop playing it since they can't find anyone to play with", "timestamp_created": 1610806992, "timestamp_updated": 1610808289, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547868132591247559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84767896": {"recommendationid": "84767896", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123177280", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1654821484}, "language": "english", "review": "hi im micheal", "timestamp_created": 1610772078, "timestamp_updated": 1610772078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525654792785644531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84486052": {"recommendationid": "84486052", "author": {"steamid": "76561199045963021", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1639160402}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0434\u0438\u0447\u044c\n", "timestamp_created": 1610364482, "timestamp_updated": 1610364482, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435975581407546997", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84431072": {"recommendationid": "84431072", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983982763", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 131, "last_played": 1611441866}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game", "timestamp_created": 1610287988, "timestamp_updated": 1610287988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84170285": {"recommendationid": "84170285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048777060", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 93, "last_played": 1612471182}, "language": "english", "review": "Terribly overpriced.

Yes, you play online against other human beings, but there's no tangible reward you accumulate for playing; no points, no cosmetics, no game passes, or ranks even. You also can't just log in and queue up into a random game immediately, as there isn't an auto-matchmaking system yet, so you need to seek out other online people in a lobby and challenge them to play, like an old-school online strategy game server.\n\nThe closest game I can compare SpyParty to is Chess. Your reward for playing is that you get to enjoy a deeply strategic and psychological experience with your opponent. Or maybe the reward is that you get to become a better player and develop a more masterful play style alongside a great community of people also looking to grow. Or if you want, your goal can be to work up to tournament play and win competitive matches (there's a SpyParty Discord Server with occasional tournaments). Watching commentated matches on Twitch is surprisingly enjoyable.\n\nLike Chess, the game is so deep that it will feel really imbalanced if you play against someone much more or much less experienced than you. There are ways to handicap either player, but it works best if you find someone to play with that's at a similar level, so you can grow your skillset together. This is the main downside to the game. However, when you're in the lobby looking for people to play with, you can see how many games they've won, and challenge someone with a similar number as you, which is a pretty decent indicator for skill level in my experience. And if you like to ask questions or play against more seasoned players as a learning experience, the Discord server has many generous and kind folks to help out.\n\nIf you just appreciate the silly concept of pretending to be a spy at a party, and want to see what that's like, that's also a totally legit reason to play, though the $25 may not be as justifiable.\n\nIn any case, Happy SpyPartying!", "timestamp_created": 1609697925, "timestamp_updated": 1609699458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544072985649108887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83879437": {"recommendationid": "83879437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865584675", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 133, "last_played": 1603661826}, "language": "english", "review": "-DIFFICULTY-\n\nMy 90 year old grandma could play it\nEasy\n\u2666Normal\nHard\n\"Dark Souls\"\n\n- GRAPHICS -\n\n\"MS Paint\"\nBad\n\u2666Meh\nGraphics don't matter in this game\nGood\nBeautiful\nMasterpiece\n\n- MUSIC -\n\u2666None\nBad\nNot special\nGood\nBeautiful\n\n- STORY -\n\n\u2666This game has no story\nLike playing \"Temple Runners\" for the story\nIt's there for the people who want it\nWell written\nEpic story\n\n- PRICE -\n\nUnderpriced\nPerfect price\nCould be cheaper\n\u2666Overpriced\nComplete waste of money\n\n- REQUIREMENTS -\n\n\u2666You can run it on a microwave\nAverage\nHigh end\n\"NASA\" computer\n\n- LENGTH -\n\nVery short (0 - 3 hours)\nShort (3 - 15 hours)\nAverage (15 - 50 hours)\nLong (50 - 90 hours)\nExtremely long (90 - 110 hours)\n\u2666 No ending\n\n- FUN -\n\nI'd rather watch paint dry\nHard to enjoy\n\u2666Repetitive\nActually pretty amusing\nRide of your life\n\n- REPLAYABILITY -\n\nIt's a one - time experience\nOnly for achievements\n\u2666If you wait a few months / years\n Definitely\nInfinitely replayable\n\n- WORTH BUYING -\n\n\u2666No\nWait for sale\nYes", "timestamp_created": 1609653258, "timestamp_updated": 1609653258, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.43105730414390564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83798625": {"recommendationid": "83798625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198871923406", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1635223191}, "language": "english", "review": "69 nice", "timestamp_created": 1609578120, "timestamp_updated": 1609578120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516857266426086426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83792195": {"recommendationid": "83792195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198412853954", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 561, "last_played": 1583239625}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u521a\u5f00\u59cb\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4f1a\u633a\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684 \u8ddf\u670b\u53cb\u73a9\u4e5f\u5f88\u523a\u6fc0\u3002\u73a9\u591a\u4e86\u4f1a\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e9bAI\u548c\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0d\u540c \u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u5c31\u627e\u5230\u95f4\u8c0d\uff0c\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5730\u56fe\u4e5f\u6709\u70b9\u5c11\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1609570283, "timestamp_updated": 1609570283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83789971": {"recommendationid": "83789971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086406069", "num_games_owned": 957, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1602251877}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend against this game because of the [b]high price.[/b]\n\nIt's a shame too, but it is really fun as it is and I assume will be even better as time moves on and the game exits the early access stage.

Until now, because SpyParty is such a great game, and I want to maybe get some people who treat the game like a party game to view it from a different angle, and to briefly sum up what the game is, and what it isn't.\n\n\nThe gameplay/content:\n\nThe spy is hiding in the party, while the sniper tries to discern them from the innocent partygoers. So far, so easy; especially since when booting up the game for the first time, you will be presented with a severely simplified experience, as to not overwhelm a new player. Then new missions for the spy to complete, as well as fresh venues to play on will be unlocked after a certain number of wins, to gradually deepen the experience. \nAt 40 wins you will be presented with the standard mode of the game, at which point you will realize that every mission just got a lot more complicated for the sniper to track, because now there are different variations of the missions avaliable, dependent on the outcome of a so called \"action test\" from the spy.\nThus the true depth of the game only unravels after already playing it for quite a while, but I wouldn't consider this a flaw, as it enables new players to gradually ease into the full experience.\nYou really don't have to be concerned about there not being enough depth to the game, I have played this game for about 400 hours and I still don't really see myself as an incredibly advanced player. This game is hard. But it also rewards you for putting in some effort and understanding how it really works.\n\nThe point that I am trying to make is the following: You can see this game as a party game. If you do, you will get some enjoyment out of it for around 2-3 hours, and then it's going to get boring before you've even seen how the game plays in standard mode. (if you find SpyParty very enjoyable casually, you do you)\nThis is actually what happened to me with the game in the summer of last year. I played it for a bit with a friend, he didn't like it too much and refunded it; and I kinda stopped playing after that, too, because I didn't see it as a game with any kind of depth to it, too.\n\nThen I came back to it in February, wanting to explore the game with a more competitive mindset. I gave it a shot (ha, see what I did there), put some effort into it, climbed the first slope of the learning curve and I had (and still have) a bloody great time with it.\n\n\nThe community:\n\nSo, basically, this game has the best community I have ever seen in a game, series, club or anthing else, period.\nIf you have a question regarding spyparty, there's always someone experienced there to help you out. People are incredibly friendly and just cool to hang out with in general. Toxic behaviour is not tolerated, neither in game, nor in the discord itself, where most of the community stuff takes place (at discord.gg/spyparty).\nThere are a lot of competitive events organized by the community, for example the current 6th season of the Spyparty Competitive League (SCL) is currently underway, casts, which are self-organized as well can be found on twitch and youtube. (twitch.tv/spyparty, respectively twitch.tv/spypartyfans and youtube.com/user/SpyPartyGame)\n\nThe topic of early access:\n\nThis game is in early access. It does NOT have any major bugs, it is visually polished freaturing a great timeless art style and it has enough depth and replayability to put every other game I know of to shame.\nIt is in early access, because the developer (yes, you heard that correctly, *the* developer, also known as Chris Hecker), has decided to continuously improve on the idea and add to the game since the first time showing it at PAX in 2010.\nThe one feature you might want as a new player that is not yet implemented is a matchmaking queue, right now the matches are found by hanging out in an in-game lobby, more about that in the next paragraph.\nThe matchmaking patch is going to be live soon, and I will amend my review on this once it hits.\n\n\nThe Lobby:\n\nEven without matchmaking, the wait time to find a game is usually below 2-3 minutes, especially during evenings in NA or EU.\nIf you take part in the discord though, you will have no major problems finding a game when asking there anyway, so either way, the missing matchmaking has never been a big problem for me.\n\nFinding matches against similarly strong opponents when starting out, on the other hand, can be a bit harder. There are also still new players coming into the game on a regular basis, though you can also play against stronger opponents enjoyably, due to the built-in handicap option, which selects the mission and guest count, as well as the time available to the spy approriately, depending on the gamecount of the players.\nIn conclusion, if you are fine with playing a stronger person on occasion, you will find matches reliably and quickly (these matches can be a great opportunity to learn new stuff about the game anyway ;) ).\n\n\nThe pricing:\n\nHere the difference in mentality really matters, if you see it as a party game for a few hours it is grossly overpriced. But that's exactly the point, it isn't just a party game, and if you are able to see spyparty for what it is - an incredibly competitive game about behaviour and awareness, in which memory, concentration, experience and mechanical execution are important, and which has a skill ceiling that no-one has even remotely seen yet - the price tag is absolutely reasonable.\nI'd buy this game for the asking price of a usual \"AAA\"-game at 50-60\u20ac.\n\n\nThe tl;dr:\n\nIf you still are convinced that this is a party game, or you want to play it as such, then I can't fullheartedly recommend it to you, but this is only because it's not a party game and it's neither balanced, supported, nor priced as such.\n\nIf you are considering buying this because you want to play an interesting, deep, competitive game about behaviour which is incredibly fun to play with a great community, BUY IT.

Here it becomes less of a party game and more of a competitive 1v1 game. As spy you have to be deceptive, blend in and creative in order to complete missions against more competent snipers.

So come and join this community! It's a super nice community with a record so clean you can eat on it (if the record was on a paper). You can also go to the official discord and find games even faster! Did I mention the community was super nice already?\nOne thing though, the game does NOT have very regular updates and has some every 3 months on average, this is because there is basically only 1 person working on the game (Chris Hecker, also more commonly known as Checker) but the updates are pure gold. One last thing, if you do buy the game, please, please, please! Play the tutorial before going into a game, not only is the tutorial great but if you don't play the tutorial, you won't understand a thing of what you're doing when playing with someone else, even if that person never played as well. You're not going to have fun, the other person won't have fun because they're always winning and you're not learning much because you don't understand a thing of what is happening. So just play the tutorial before playing online, for your sake and all of ours.\n\nFor the original review:\nI spent 46 hours when I write this and this will keep going up, this game is one of the best games I have ever played, you need to try and read the mind of the sniper when you're spy and guess where he is looking, as sniper, you need to keep track of a lot of things and for me that's very entertaining. People can say it's too much money, who would pay 25 dollars for this kind of game? Well I can tell you that I am very happy with this purchase. Some reviews also say that there are not enough players and they don't receive an invite for 1 hour, I disagree totally, the best time for you to go is between 8pm and 2am gmt time and you'll for sure find players, even not at these times, you'll probably find a player after only 10 min maximum, even less if you have discord. If you do have discord, there are tournaments you can participate in and they will teach you everything you need to know about the game and you can chat with Chris Hecker (the one who developed the game) and talk about the future of the game and if you look at the news you see that he is always working on the game.\n\ntl;dr This is the best purchase I have made for a video game in a long time.", "timestamp_created": 1551816050, "timestamp_updated": 1589996460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641674995422363281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49137158": {"recommendationid": "49137158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198419999882", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 423, "last_played": 1662157223}, "language": "english", "review": "Were interesting game", "timestamp_created": 1550753647, "timestamp_updated": 1550753647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491722226142883301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48919375": {"recommendationid": "48919375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276393582", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 600, "last_played": 1581460918}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is thrilling and a great way to spend time with my boyfriend.", "timestamp_created": 1549866591, "timestamp_updated": 1549866591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498007982969284058", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48839967": {"recommendationid": "48839967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047524140", "num_games_owned": 1008, "num_reviews": 159, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 50, "last_played": 1525569228}, "language": "english", "review": "While I do think the game is very interesting and I can see why it would be popular, personally it's just way too stressful and gives me way too much anxiety to do anything as spy, and because of how the game works at least in my experience it's almost impossible to anything at all besides moving without immediately getting shot. I am unable to see any way to gain experience or skill at the game to actually start getting wins as a spy, but even then regardless I can't even play the game for 10 minutes without feeling like I'm about to have a heart attack, and I'm the kind of person who never has that issue with games, so why this game in particular has that effect, especially so soon, I just can't understand. And when playing as sniper, I find it incredibly easy because I always end up just watching a spy at the edge of the scope with the laser pointed somewhere else and they will do basically anything thinking that I'm simply not looking. It feels like by far the most unbalanced thing I have ever seen, and playing only as sniper gets boring extremely quickly, and feels like I'm locking myself out of half of the entire game.

I haven't seen any new updates for the past 2 years.\nA: Yes it is, however there is no current timeline for when future updates will be released.\n\nQ: Will the game go on sale soon? $25 is a bit much to convince friends to get the game with me.\nA: Currently, the dev's response is that there won't be a sale soon. Quote from dev on reasoning: \"...the new user experience is still too rough.  Sales bring in a bunch of new players, including new players who are ever-so-slightly less interested in putting in effort to overcome bad UI or poor early game onramping, both of which SpyParty has in spades, and so it\u2019d be a waste to put it on sale before I fix that stuff because a lot of folks who might like SpyParty if that stuff was fixed would just bounce off it.  Better to wait until it\u2019s smoother for them.  I realize this philosophy temporarily screws over folks who are super motivated to learn the game and are just short on money, and I\u2019m sorry for that, but I think on balance it\u2019s the right thing for the game and community in the long run.\"\n\nIn the future, the dev plans to allow \"spawn copies,\" which allows people who own the game to play versus friends who don't own the game.\n\nQ: Should I get the game?\nA: I think if you're in one of these two scenarios, you should definitely get it. The first being you have a friend who also will buy the game so you can play against each other. It will be fun obviously since you're playing with a friend, but it will also be ideal in terms of skill level. The second scenario is that you've seen the competitive casts on Youtube or Twitch and you are interested in joining in the comp scene. The community is incredible and VERY dedicated at running competitions/casts year round which contributes to why game is still very much active despite not receiving a major game update since November 2019 with the addition of the Redwoods venue.\n\nIf you aren't in one of these two scenarios, I would personally recommend wishlisting it for now and checking back when more features like matchmaking or spawn copies are added. But if you're still eager to play then please do join us, the community is very welcoming and the discord can help with mentoring if you have the patience to learn playing against a higher skilled player.", "timestamp_created": 1548216668, "timestamp_updated": 1660194842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48360556": {"recommendationid": "48360556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195757569", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 119, "last_played": 1547503340}, "language": "english", "review": "fun but would be more fun if people were playing it", "timestamp_created": 1547626573, "timestamp_updated": 1547626573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512354135513305664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48350787": {"recommendationid": "48350787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162491106", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 749, "last_played": 1562521372}, "language": "english", "review": "Too expenisve for this game", "timestamp_created": 1547576510, "timestamp_updated": 1547576510, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 164, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.788998603820800781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48341685": {"recommendationid": "48341685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450670622", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 100, "last_played": 1547273960}, "language": "english", "review": "Was a great game.

It's much more fun to play with someone you know.  There is a learning curve and as the sniper it's easy to be overwhelmed by what's going on when you're first starting out.

A spy can take two sips from their drink or just gulp it for example...perhaps the AI doesn't have the gulp action?

Playing against someone who knows all the tells will no doubt be frustrating, but might prove to be a great learning experience if you're both able to talk after the match is over and they're willing to educate you.

Another option would a free client that allows you to connect and play only with people who have purchased the game. As it stands its very hard to find players the times I have been online players have been in the single digits.\n\nThe game has depth and is pretty fun but very limited in variation. It basically requires being on voice communication with a friend or it is unplayable as the lobby system currently is straight outta the early 90s and has no one really in it ever. There are different maps and customizable objectives but there is essentially only one game mode where one person plays as a spy trying to complete objectives and another person has to identify and stop the spy.\n\nI'd really like to see some more features and development in a direction that would both expand the community and offer more value for the steep asking price.\n\nSome possible ideas:\n\nIntegrate support for more then 1v1 gameplay. The easiest to implement would just allow x number of snipers vs the 1 spy. \n\nPerhaps there are multiple spies working together to try and complete more objectives. Maybe there could be a 1v1v1 gameplay mode where the spies race to complete x objectives first. Maybe there is both a sniper and an agent at the party with creative ways to eliminate the spy.\n\n However it is done there needs to be support for more than 1v1 gameplay so all 5 of the people in the lobby can play together if they choose. \n\nLocal play via the sniper using a smartphone/tablet \n\nBuilt in VOIP!!!\n\nThere are tons of option but expanding the functionality of what is essentially a strong party game should be a huge priority. I could see this game being much more succesful both in sales volume and word of mouth press with something like a 4 pack for 50 dollars if game modes that allowed at least 4 people to play together. This would also allow newer and solo players to join games with people with more experience with some of the depth the game has to offer beacuse currently it can be an extremly underwhelming experience as a solo player.\n\ngood luck homie", "timestamp_created": 1537484315, "timestamp_updated": 1537484825, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578524768352508545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44788924": {"recommendationid": "44788924", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960651343", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1537653315}, "language": "english", "review": "always shoot grandma shes up to no good", "timestamp_created": 1537222977, "timestamp_updated": 1537222977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464623242616653442", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44745568": {"recommendationid": "44745568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275641882", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1590418248}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446. \u041d\u0430\u0441\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0435\u0434\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443, \u0441\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e 1.7 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043a \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u0430\u043c:\n\n- \u0417\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430.\n- \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b.\n- \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.\n- \u0412\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f\u043c\u0438.\n- \u0414\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430.\n\n\u041d\u0443 \u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438, \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044b:\n\n- \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b. \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0444\u0435\u0439\u0441, \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443, \u043b\u044e\u0434\u044f\u043c \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b., \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e.\n- \u0411\u0435\u0442\u0430 -

Not with the gameplay itself but the playerbase of it. I could wait in the lobby for 1 hour and not receive a single invite to play. Today I logged on during a primetime - a sunday night. And only 6 people were in the lobby. \n\nI cannot recommend anyone purchasing this game for $25 and not even be able to play it because there is nobody to play with in the first place. Check my public profile photos for evidence.\n\nSad really.\n\nOriginal Review:\nThis review is both an important suggestion to the developer and also a review of the game.\n\nThis is a great game with a very unique concept not seen anywhere else. This is something I know for a fact every one of my friends who even remotely touch games would like to try. However, when you compare this game to other games at the $25 price point, this game is definitely not up to par. This is DEFINITELY not to say that this game is inferior or less fun than other games out there. SImply put, the amount of content being provided is only worth $10, especially because everything about this game seems to be worked on by a single person(Same voice actor for the tutorial, the same voice actor for the sound effects in the game, slipshod lobbyroom, etc.)\n\nAt most, there are only 20 people in the lobby at once, a very sad sight, because my hope would be for this game to have bigger traffic. Seriously, their discord page is also a desert. This is in my honest and educated opinion; as a result of the high price point being put forward, it is really pushing people away from this awesome game. I would love to show this game and convince my friends to buy spyparty, but unfortunately I know for a fact that the response would be - \"25 dollars??? eh...\"\n\nI strongly believe that this game needs to be put forward at $10, and then remarketted into media sources. Ie, free copys to big youtubers such as pewdiepie, markiplier, etc. \n\nIn fact, videogamedunkey has already made a video of this game and his video has 2.5m views! You would think after that the game would hit off and people would start purchasing it, yet as mentioned before, the playerbase is only 20 people!!! I believe this clearly shows how much the pricetag is dissuading people from making a purchase.\n\nI hope you can see this message developer. I'm sure that you take a lot of pride in your work and view this game as your life's work and artpiece. However, decreasing a games price does NOT mean it is a lesser game. And it will ultimately reap in bigger benefits for both your community and revenue.", "timestamp_created": 1536198570, "timestamp_updated": 1537750046, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58844912052154541", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44496671": {"recommendationid": "44496671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013969036", "num_games_owned": 472, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 3122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1663582598}, "language": "english", "review": "I am changing this review upon reading the snarky comments from the developer in the Steam forums.

While the gameplay is already really good, there's no matchmaking or handicap system yet, so you have to be willing to wait around in lobby for a game and then put up with a \"teaching game\" from a much stronger player.

I was watching some videos about it before and at first the price really scared me away. But then, I bought it anyway and I can really say that, by a simple Funtime/Money ratio, this game is absolutely worth the money. Here are some reasons why:\n\n- It is unique in it's gameplay. I've never played a game before where you have to try to be as AI-like as you can. \n- It is a really tense experience. The time when you are putting a book away in the wrong bookshelf and seeing the laser coming towards you and expecting the shot but they just go on and you can live for another minute is just AWESOME!\n- It is really fun watching other people play. Besides all the people who stream Spyparty there are a lot of great commented casts of the competitive leagues.\n- The community is one of the friendliest I have ever seen in a game. I personally don't like playing online games that much with strangers because of the, well, internet. But here, especially the most succesfull and experienced players, the people are friendly and really want everyone to have fun with the game, explaining little details and features of the game. \n\nNow, besides all these awesome Things there might be some things you could struggle with in your first hours with Spyparty.\n- The lobby is really ugly and there is no matchmaking system YET. But I never had to wait more then 10 minutes before someone showed up to play with. The game has sound cues if something happens in the lobby so you can happily have the game minimized while doing other stuff and waiting for people coming to the lobby.\n- The first games can be quite hard, especially against a experienced player. I suggest leaving the \"beginner\" dificulty as early as possible. Don't get frustrated if you get shot! Losing is an integral part of the game, basically.\n- One can only learn playing this game when talking ot the opponent. A little \"hi\" in the beginning helps a lot and it's just more fun when you can discuss a match with your opponent after you have been shot \"Oh, I didn't see that! I just thought you moved weird\" \n- The game has a lot to offer which sometimes can't be seen in the first \"difficulty\" stages. Again, try to leave \"beginner\" as early as possible. If you don't mind being a little overwhelmed by possibilites, just go to \"standard\" really quick.\n\nSo, I REALLY suggest, you go to the official twitchpage of SpyParty and look at some of the commented plays there. They give you a feeling what the game has to offer, what kind of game it is and if it is for you. I'm just saying: Do not NOT buy it, because someone said it is a \"minigame\" after playing it for 90 Minutes. Because it is really not a minigame.

Unfortunately, when you price a game at 25 dollars, it's hard to convince friends to play. I would avoid writing this review if the Devs gave it some thought, but they have repeatedly stated that they will keep the price tag, and maybe even increase it once out of Early Access.

It is very simple, but at the same time has so many hidden depths, you never really stop learning. When you lose, most of the time you can either already know why, or you LEARN why, and adjust for it. There are players with tens of thousands of games played, and they will tell you they are still learning as they play. It is unbelievably complex. It's NOT a party game as some people say, it is probably closer to Chess. Seemingly simple, unbelievably in depth.\n\nBut here is the number one tip:\n\nAT THE VERY LEAST, PLAY THE TUTORIAL.\n\nThis game is HARD. It doesn't matter how good you are at other video games, this one has got a HIGH barrier of entry. You will not understand what is happening. As the sniper, you won't see a thing and still lose, and as the spy, you will get shot for reasons you haven't even considered. There is a lot to learn, and whilst the game SEEMS simple, it is incredibly complex. If you dive into the deep end too quickly, or if you stay in the shallow end for too long, you won't get the full experience of the game. Anyway, here is a quick rundown:\n\n- PLAY THE TUTORIAL. I cannot stress this enough, it's a really good entry point and teaches you the basics.\n- BEGINNER MODE IS NOT THE FULL GAME. It's not even HALF the full game. It's probably closer to a quarter of the game, if that. There's 8 total missions, and not only does beginner mode only have 4 of them, you don't even have full versions of all the missions either. It's also missing half the maps. That's not to say it's bad, it's a VERY good entry point, but you will want to move through this one RELATIVELY quickly once you get the hang of things. If you are bored of the game but haven't even gone past Beginner, that is why.\n- Intermediate is BETTER, giving you access to (I think?) every mission, but again, it's not the full version of the missions you get in Standard. Intermediate is about half the game, and is good place to stay on if you're still finding yourself overwhelmed as the Sniper, though it can bring bad habits if you stay on it too long.\n- Standard is where everything falls into place. Things like statue swapping, or purloining the guest list no longer point out who the Spy is, it just shows where the Spy has been... or they COULD still be there. Bugging the Ambassador can happen whilst moving, so are a lot harder to keep track of, and the Spy doesn't necessarily need to talk to contact the double agent. It becomes a LOT more about mind games, trying to do things right under the Sniper's nose, and making calculated risks.\n\nIt takes a while to get there, though, and if you're not willing to put in the time (It honestly only takes half an hour every other day, it doesn't need to be a game you play for 6 hours in one go!) then that's ok! There's just a lot of people who don't realise what they're signing up for, get overwhelmed, and wrongfully call it a bad game, or people who never switch off of Beginner and say the game is one dimensional.\n\nThis is not a game for everyone, but if it IS for you, you'll stack up hundreds of games of it.\n\nAs one final point: The community is absolutely fantastic. They're all very welcoming for new players, willing to teach you (if you're willing to learn), and is diverse + welcoming to anyone. You can join the discord if you want to talk to players before you buy, or check out most twitch streams (as long as they're not new players) and both the viewers + streamers will be willing to give you pointers here and there. We all love the game, and want to share it with other players, so don't be afraid to ask questions, and scout it out before you buy.", "timestamp_created": 1531346654, "timestamp_updated": 1531346654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57666170597076416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43451358": {"recommendationid": "43451358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038769495", "num_games_owned": 904, "num_reviews": 159, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1531252942}, "language": "english", "review": "*sigh* it would have been a great game, but no one plays it\n\nedit: still never on sale, not even worth 25% of what it costs, currently theres only 20 people playing. matchmaking was never implemented. the dev seriously needs to get a clue.", "timestamp_created": 1531252964, "timestamp_updated": 1620050904, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485031306743621826", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1531335864, "developer_response": "Sorry you were having trouble finding a match!

I've already sunk over 300 hours and played over 3,000 individual matches. The game's depth seems bottomless, and even the veterans of the game who've been playing for almost half a decade still learn new things constantly.\n\nSpyParty is truly the video game version of chess. Almost anyone can pick it up and play their friends competitively, but if you're to invest time into learning the complex strategies and mechanics of the game, you can start to dive into the mastery of it, that even the top players claim they haven't achieved.\n\n[h1] \"SpyParty isn't for everyone\" [/h1]\nSpyParty isn't for everyone. The developer has purposely chosen the price of the game as to reflect the premium that comes with the depth/replayability of this title (which has been in development since 2009). This, in turn, encourages a smaller, more dedicated community. If you're looking for an arcade-like game to play a couple of times with a friend, you might be better finding something else, as the price tag will likely be too high. Too many new players either watch or try the \"Beginner vs. Beginner\" mode (which has 4 missions and 4 maps), and never move on to the standard version of the game (currently titled 'Experienced')\n\nIt's also mainly a one-man project. Developer Chris Hecker seems to be developing SpyParty primarily solo, and updates are few and far between. Could be a turning off point for many newcomers.\n\n[h1] A \"1v1 game to master\" [/h1]\nHowever, if you're looking for a truly competitive 1v1 game to master, with one of the friendliest, mature and most willing to educate communities I've come across in my time of gaming, then consider giving SpyParty a try.\n\nThis game will take you as far as you're willing to go with it.

Also, there has been zero updates since Launch, even through the devs promised to fix certain, small things one week after launch, then he needed another week and another. Im not really convinced that he will finish this game, or that it will take years, which is just as bad to keep the Playerbase alive.\nWithout a playerbase, there really is not much of a game.

It should be out soon.  As for the playerbase, the game has been going for years before Steam with an even smaller number of concurrent players and even then the wait for a match was pretty short even at off-peak times, so I'm not too worried about it right now.  Matchmaking will help a lot, since it'll free up people who are currently in a lobby match to round robin with other matchmaking players.  The fact that it's 1v1 and short playtimes means it can run with a small playerbase and still be healthy. As for content, hopefully you saw all 10 maps, since the current UI is bad at helping players get off the first 4 maps.  Hopefully you'll revisit your review when matchmaking is in and you see the low wait times for a game. :)"}, "42225968": {"recommendationid": "42225968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198437239864", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 784, "last_played": 1637455300}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing game with, so far as I know, a never-before-seen topic that continues to blow my mind!", "timestamp_created": 1527205702, "timestamp_updated": 1527205702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518187224864959717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42197483": {"recommendationid": "42197483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077047344", "num_games_owned": 1627, "num_reviews": 172, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 98, "last_played": 1529161884}, "language": "english", "review": "Great fun with a friend but I would never pay this much for this game.", "timestamp_created": 1527097107, "timestamp_updated": 1527097107, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556960523128509521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42162383": {"recommendationid": "42162383", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965296674", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1090, "last_played": 1627928868}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the game and the game mechanic.

Enjoy :) [/quote]\n\n[b] Banana Bread... [/b]\n\nSpyParty is a game developed Chris Hecker and John Cimino and published by Chris Hecker\n\nThis game is [i] finally [/i] on Steam Early Access after years and years being developed effortlessly by Chris Hecker\n\nThe game's premise is simple, you either play the Spy or the Sniper. With the Sniper you have to pinpoint down the Spy and with the Spy you have to blend in with the rest of the party's members\n\nIt is really fun to play, simple to learn and hard to master. SpyParty can be enjoyed as a casual experience with friends but this is a deceptively deep and subtle challenge\n\nThere are still some Early Access rough edges. The developer has been making slow but steady progress for years, and is very responsive to feedback. The community is one of the best in gaming, eager to answer questions and mentor new players\n\nSpyParty's foibles don\u2019t affect the core gameplay, which is rock solid.

I have yet to encounter a toxic person and everyone is willing to help and point mistakes if you ask them.\n\nThe only negatives right now is the lobby UI which is a little rough and the lack of tutorial for the experienced missions, both of which are about to change as the game leaves early access.\n\nThe price may seem steep for an indie game in early access. I had doubts myself before i bought it, but if you feel this kind of game interests you, it's worth every single penny.\n", "timestamp_created": 1524925131, "timestamp_updated": 1524925131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534388303756713867", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41736427": {"recommendationid": "41736427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038213518", "num_games_owned": 569, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 452, "last_played": 1636419275}, "language": "english", "review": "Update: This games community is pretty dead, a sale and or a price reduction would do it some good. The quality of content here is really good. But it's tough to justify the price when there's no one to play with unless you have a dedicated partner. Good luck and god speed finding someone to play with on their discord, the LFG section is basically dead. Thus I changed my recommendation to No.\n\nPrevious Review:\n\nSpy Party is one of those games that's easy to get into but hard to master. The idea is simple, two players face off in an enviroment. The Spy trying to blend into the AI and complete his tasks (which is often quite tense and challenging) and The Sniper, tying to spot out the spy. With multiple objectives, varying difficulties and learning new methods/strategies, this game has a lot going for it. \nThis is my favourite game to play for short burts as a game tends to last ~5min if not less. \nThe community is also very kind, I often have pleasant interactions through the text chat ingame, talking about how we discoverd each other and discussing different strategies. \nPeople have complained about the price and I can understand their complaints if they choose to not invest too much time into learning the game and stick to only the beginner difficulty. This game really starts to open up at Intermediate and greater. \n\nSpy Party offers a ton of replayability and enjoyment that I'm sure to continue to get my money's worth.", "timestamp_created":

This week, I finally got to try the tutorial and one online game and it did not disappoint. With all the moving parts in SpyParty, I was worried about how long it\u2019d take me to learn the its nuances \u2013 I knew I wouldn\u2019t be good immediately, but I at least wanted to understand what others were doing to make them good. The tutorial did a great job of this. Chris Hecker himself narrates it and walks you through the facilities and strategies of both the Sniper and Spy.\n\nAs the Spy, you are trying to complete objectives in a time limit without getting caught. Each of the objectives will expose you to some degree \u2013 swapping a statue is particularly risky because the Sniper can memorize the statue placement in advance. As a Sniper, you\u2019re looking for these tells with the ability to \u201clowlight\u201d or \u201chighlight\u201d guests based on your observations. When you\u2019re sure, you can pull the trigger.\n\nGetting through the tutorial gave me the false sense of confidence I needed to dive right in to online multiplayer. I lost in short order but knew exactly why and this is SpyParty\u2019s biggest boon. It\u2019s immediately readable and relays complex information in understandable fashion, allowing the player to trust the game and eventually, their instincts.

The spy must complete a few missions at this party to win before a timer runs out, and must try to strike a balance between working toward his missions, and acting natural to throw off his would-be assassin.  The sniper can win by shooting the spy, of course, but also by keeping such close tabs on the party that there is no safe way for the spy to complete his missions before time runs out.  At the end of each round, the players switch sides between sniper and spy roles.  Matches continue for as many rounds as the players wish, and score is kept each round.\n\nControls in the game are very simple and can be learned in a few minutes by following the tutorial.  Advanced play benefits from a few optional mechanics that significantly enrich the game and improve balance.  These optional mechanics aren't explained well in the tutorial, but when you're ready to try them in your matches, you'll find the community is suprisingly friendly and willing to help you learn.  Withing just a few games, you'll feel comfortable playing with all the advanced rules, and you'll have fun while learning.  To improve quickly, you can also watch replays of your matches, and spectate other players as they play.\n\nSpy Party was in early beta for several years before hitting Steam.  It shows.  As of Steam release, matchmaking and replays have a few minor bugs, but gameplay is highly polished.  The game isn't demanding on hardware, and it is very forgiving of high latency connections.\n\nUltimately, Spy Party is a very different kind of PvP strategy game- unique but familiar, with nuance and complexity rarely found in strategy titles.

I was part of the Beta prior to Steam, that's why I said \"I got the product for free\", even though I paid for it, just not through Steam. I do have few hours through Steam, but over 500 or something through the Early Beta days)\n\nCONCEPT \n\nHoly shit, SpyParty has the best game concept I have seen... I'm not joking. It's one of a kind, and I hope it remains to be one of a kind. The overall idea is that you want to mingle around a bunch of AI's while trying to do some missions, or, on the other hand, trying to shoot the player mingling... Sounds simple, right? Nope, it is not... \n\nThe concept is based off of a reverse of the Turing test. If you don't know, the Turing test was/is a way of a machine to reveal human behavior, so basically a test to see if AI could imitate human behavior. As some of you might have already understood, the reverse Turing test would be a human trying to imitate AI... Which sounds incredibly stupid, but works in the best way possible... \n\nThe concept, while being amazing, adds a sense of deepness to the game, where even though it's a bit repetitive, it never gets boring.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay is... a rollercoaster, I would say. It's hard to compare it to anything in this regard, but imagine this: while playing Spy, the laser goes over you, and suddenly your blood starts to rush, as you suspect you're about to get shot... and then the laser continues to move; as the Sniper, everything seems confusing and paranoia is a constant: Was that a bug? Did the timer go up?\n\nIt's simple and yet deep? There's no way to explain it but to play it. In a way, it is simple because the goal is clear... And yet, it is deep, for I, a player with over 3.2 k rounds in this game, still continue to learn new things every day... It proves to be a hell of a ride.\n\nAI \n\nThe AI do SO MUCH stuff... And I mean so much. Picking up statues, books, briefcases, drinks, talking, checking their watches... Am I forgetting something? Oh yeah, they walk.. And they walk a lot... You'll get paranoid.\n\nThe AI do have specific things they do, but at the same time, there are only a few bugs that can make you rule out those AI's, and even if you're the spy, you can't honestly be mad, since one lowlight out of 13 guests is nothing, right?\n\nThey are weird, though. Chris has given them so much freedom, and this freedom happens to make the game way funnier, with animation weirdness and some things that will just make you get an adrenaline rush.\n\nREPLAY SYSTEM\n\nHoly hell, is the replay system amazing. 6 camera angles at your disposal, automatic file saving to be watched later, and even the opportunity to play Sniper against the Spy on the replay!!!! \n\nSome people have seen Chris' enthusiasm and said \"No, this game will never make it to E-Sports\", but it has, and the replay system is truly what makes it so special for people like us, that just watch it on Twitch or even in the game itself. \n\nAnd also, watching a replay is always good after you finish the match, to see what you might've missed or how things looked for the Sniper... \n\nOf course, other thing I also love is to save specific files with the name of \"MissShots\" or \"To Practice Sniper\", in specific folders.\n\nART\n\nOk, the art is amazing. Most people agree on this \"The art is amazing\" and honestly, I can't disagree... It fits the game's theme while remaining timeless, even though I suspect that everything happens in the past, and not in the present nor in the future... \n\nHowever, if you look hard enough, you will see elements of the old art... Mannequins roaming around, with uncostumizable animations... I remember those days...\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nI feel like there is no much to say, other than the color pallette of this is amazing and I love the diversity\n\nMISSIONS\n\nThey make the game great... You have missions you can camp, and missions you need to watch closely for... Soft and hard tells... Missions a spy almost always does, and missions you can only shoot if you're lucky... Even though I do feel like there should be more missions (Chris is working on it of course), they, for now, are enough and balanced.\n\nMAPS\n\nGreat variety of maps... There are only 10, but it's amazing how the map can manipulate the game... Maps like Balcony can be so directed to the Sniper, while you can roam freely as the Spy on Libray or Veranda... The available missions shift with these, and it ends up being amazing.\n\nMODES\n\nModes are a bit... bad, to be honest... I understand the need for there to be a beginner side of things, but I do feel like the Intermediate mode is a bit unbalanced towards the Spy, that only needs to do 3 missions in 4 minutes? \n\nSome people think Beginner is unbalanced because you can just camp the statues, but honestly, it's supposed to be beginner. The sniper will eventually realise this, and so people move on to Intermediate, where I feel like they are left out on a lot: Action tests; walking bugs; delegates; next person swaps; framing; briefcase; etc....\n\nExperienced mode comes in out of nowhere, and kind of opens a lot of possibilites, leaving new players stomped.\n\nTUTORIAL\n\nRelated to the previous point, the tutorial never speaks about Action tests or important stuff... I kinda feel like it needs some improving...\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\nOMG, if this isn't the best community in the gaming industry, then holy heck. Everyone is friendly. It's toxicity-free.. No joke... The veterans try to help out the new players, and always share tips, and even if you want to talk about non-related game stuff, we're always here for you. \n\nOf course this is something that may change, and I'm nervous about it with the Steam release and everything, but hopefully you'll stay friendly and Chris nominates some moderators to ban people.\n\nAlso, please talk if you come to the game. There is nothing worse than having an opponent who refuses to explain their actions and learn from their mistakes.\n\nUI\n\nUI needs some improving, I feel like that is something a lot of people agree with... New players have a hard time figuring out how to go to Intermediate, and the lobby looks a bit ugly..... Inviting is something that they are also confused about, and I feel like it needs a bit of a brush-up...\n\nIN GENERAL\n\nPeople do complain a bit about the price, but I happen to disagree. See, SpyParty is not for everyone, I will admit it. You have to actually think if you want this or not. The skill curve is super steep, and you will get some stomp matches, but as long as you keep an open head, you will be good. And this sense of deepness totally justifies its price. For those that disagree, try playing the game more. Maybe you'll understand...\n\nTLDR\n\nPROS\nGreat Concept\nAmazing Gameplay\nHilarious and Tricky AI\nGorgeous Art\nDiverse Characters\nSense of Complexity\nGreat Replay System\nDiverse and Yet Familiar Missions\nSeveral Different Maps That Change Everything\nThe Best Community\nSurprinsigly Cheap for What It Is\n\nCONS\nBad UI\nUnbalanced Modes\nLack of Information on Tutorial\n\n\nOverall, definitely get it if you are in for a learning experience, awesome community, and some Banana Bread!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1524350746, "timestamp_updated": 1524350746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683145761489868164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41610099": {"recommendationid": "41610099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077579337", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1530377832}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy buen juego, el ambientes, la tension, el miedo por que te cojan o la intriga de pensar que te estas perdiendo todo.\nen los niveles inferiores no es tan divertido por que algunas mecanicas dan mucho el cante,pero despues de eso genial.\nsientes que es una mezcla GENIAL entre jeugo de mesa y juego de pc!\nal poco que cambien los menus y a\u00f1adan modos con mas jugadores, sera genial!", "timestamp_created": 1524333992, "timestamp_updated": 1524333992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41608985": {"recommendationid": "41608985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067870630", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1530509131}, "language": "english", "review": "Both brothers got home at 10pm.

The gameplay seems simple at first but the strategies you use to win are diverse.\n\nThe variety of the results is great: no two rounds end the same. Sometimes you will be playing as the spy and give yourself up right away. Other times it will be a nail biter and you will have to juggle wondering if the spy is almost done with their missions and how much time you have left to gather more evidence.\n\nThe maps all have different feels to playing them.

The core gameplay was there, but the polish wasn't. I played a couple games a year to watch the progress and I'm really happy to see how this game has evolved.\n\nThe evolving meta between snipers and spies is really where this game shines.\n\n* Game 1: Spy goes straight for a statue swap, a microfilm transfer, and an ambassador bugging, winning the game.\n* Game 2: Sniper watches the only statues, catches the spy in the act, and wins.\n* Game 3: Spy goes for subtler missions (\"soft tells\") like seducing another guest, inspecting statues, and fingerprinting the ambassador, wins because the sniper was watching only for a swap the whole time.\n* Game 4: Sniper watches for guests moving around a lot, lowlighting guests that stay still for long stretches of time. Finds one that's moving a whole lot more than others. Snipes. Wins.\n* Game 5: Spy slows it down, spends time chilling in conversation circles, tries to throw off the scent...\n\nYou see where this goes. It's a back and forth between evenly matched players that grows over time. The only thing this game needs is ranked matchmaking. I have no doubt Chris will eventually get around to it... \"soon\". ;)\n\nEdit 3 years later:\n\nI _had_ said yes, but I'm going to have to change my recommendation to a no. That matchmaking has been absent for so long and the community remains relatively small means that the only way you're going to enjoy this game is with a friend dedicated to learning alongside you. And at that point you're looking at $50 between the two of you.\n\nI dunno.

I am, at least at the time of this writing, one of the top players in the game's competitive scene, though I hope you're here to dethrone me (it's very doable).\n\nI have been playing video games, devotedly, since 1988. \n\nThis game is the video game with the most depth that I have ever played, and I have played a LOT of video games, competitive games and otherwise.  After five years, 18000 games, and six hundred hours, I still feel like I have barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer.  After making it to the top of the competitive ladder, I still feel that, nevertheless, I am nowhere near the game's skill cap.\n\nIt's a truly wonderful game, with detailed, thoughtful design choices, an extremely unique and amazing premise, and as I have said, immense competitive depth.  It rewards the thoughtful, the patient, and the eager-to-learn.  This game has rewired my brain in astonishing ways that get you thinking differently, a bit like when you played Portal for the first time, but more so.\n\nThe game itself is excellent, with breathtaking, beautiful art, and I have never been more pleased to strongly recommend something on Steam.  It's as polished and well-designed as a non-early-access game and I'd buy it as a completed game as-is for $60, as I said.

SpyParty is pure genius and is deeply intricate which I'd say is where most people run into their first gripe. There should definitly be an updated better tutorial. I don't buy reviews complaining about not being able to play ever. The lobby is yes; relatively small, but be a bit more patient. \n\nThere are plenty instances where you can simply play sniper as well, Sniping is the truly the most crucial skill of the game. Weeding out all the opponents instances of interaction with AI, while simultaneously carrying out your strategy to dissect the party is the challenge. It's usually easier to get away with cheap wins being spy, sniper is no joke you degenerate. \n\nIt's fun using chat at times as well, I like the primitive feel I hope it stays that way honestly. Every menu executes perfectly. Chat is crucial during rounds for each to fully master their mishaps.\n\nThe advantage of having the Spy being a relatively easy task to cheese, is each player gets their chance to learn through the sniper of the true nature of the party. The accuracy type task performing tests to hit green, red, or gray with clicking left is satisfying to master (Tests are only preformed while Spy). Each color performs a different effect depending on the task at hand. No matter your skill it's likely new players pickup this skill quick which is gold. For example; if you switch a statue hitting green, it will appear to the sniper as if the next AI who picks up that same statue has done the statue swap. If you hit red a thump of metal is heard by the sniper.\n\nI understand it's high price, it's well worth that money but I understand getting two friends to buy it can be difficult at times.

SpyParty is a wonderful, incredibly competitive game about hiding in plain sight, keeping track of party guests, and bannabread. Over those 329 games, SpyParty has made me feel every emotion under the sun and then some. I really cannot sing enough praises about the game.\n\nIn addition to having crackerjack gameplay, SpyParty also offers a whole bunch of features you would expect from a high-budget eSports game. SpyParty has game replays so you can watch all the games where pesky Spies stole your guest list. The replay system also offers a sort of singleplayer experience because you can play sniper games against the replays of Spy games. Meaning you can take on top players without putting your ego at stake. Features like these are fantastic and Chris Hecker is still working hard at making them even better.\n\nThat being said, the game is tiny. If you watch a video on YouTube, you will probably see most of what the game has to offer. The game is also relatively hard to get into, not because of a bad community or anything, but because mastering this game is a daunting task that may seem worse when you see people in lobbies with 3000+ wins on Spy and Sniper. SpyParty feels incredibly rewarding however, you are always learning something new every time you play.\n\nI love SpyParty and I hope that you will give it a try if it interests you.", "timestamp_created": 1523948485, "timestamp_updated": 1523948485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.707993805408477783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41533129": {"recommendationid": "41533129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070557003", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 22097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1663448747}, "language": "english", "review": "This is hands-down the most thrilling and tense two player game I have ever played.

The name caught my attention. \nRead some reviews, watched some trailers, watched some streams, visited the subreddit, and pulled the trigger. \n\nIts a very fun game with a lot of depth. There's a steep learning curve and I don't know if you can truely master it as there are many variables with the AI behaviors that make each game unique. .This is good of course. But again, difficult to get \"gud\" at. \n\nDue to the time restriction in each level coupled with all the various missions makes for a rewarding and challanging game for the SPY. I do feel a number of wins as a Spy come from my opponent taking an innocent life, this isn't as satisfying as completing the missions.\n\nSnipers role is different. Very chaotic. A lot of people doing a lot of things and you have to spot the irregularity, very tough in higher difficulties. In contrast, its too easy on some maps. Like the pub for example, you can camp trophies until you notice it a swap. Theres only two of them and they're very easy to view. This an example of an area that needs tweaking. It's great for training, which is the intent, but its almost too easy and matches end very quickly because of it. \n\nThere isn't another game on the market that is like the experience presented by SpyParty.

For people who are worried about the price tag and the amount of content, you've probably read that the game is deep, but also realize that each map plays in a unique way, and that each character has a suite of custom animations which affect how you play them as spy: want to bug the ambassador smoothly? Use papa danger and his cane; want to contact the double agent, want to swap statue and block the sniper's view? Use Taft's girth to block their view. Want to contact the double agent without being seen talking? Business woman takes several breaks during her talking animation, so just cancel talking without a jarring animation break. \n\nThis is one of my favorite games of all time. I put about about 40 hours into in the pre-steam beta. I've bounced off of other competitive games but SpyParty keeps me coming back because of the great community, and because it rewards dedication and study in a way many games don't. I am still learning new techniques to avoid detection and manage my perception of everything going on at the party. This game teaches you to read others, and to understand yourself.\n\nThe game is laser-focused on social interactions; it's a game where you can shoot someone for spending too much time with one guest , for talking out of turn, for being rude to the waiter; a game where you can win by framing another guest, by waiting patiently for the perfect opportunity, by blending in so thoroughly you feel like a self-actualized machine.", "timestamp_created": 1523903699, "timestamp_updated": 1528606919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41527037": {"recommendationid": "41527037", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994471858", "num_games_owned": 494, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 93, "last_played": 1582844430}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought it five years ago, enjoyed it, and just happened to not play much more in the past years.

When I first heard about it, I thought it was one of the most brilliant game concepts I ever heard of. I still believe that.\n\nAt a glance, this game seems like a one-trick pony. But it's really not. This is a game of behavior, deception, and blending in, all while racing against the clock. And on the flip side, you have a game of reading subtle cues, behavior, and using your attention to its best efficiency.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys a game with a deep meta-game, SpyParty is the game for you. Once you start managing to divert the sniper's attention with a fake attempt to contact the double agent to try a mission with a more obvious tell, you'll cackle will glee as the sniper's sight visibly becomes erratic trying to highlight and lowlight suspects - meanwhile, you swap a statue. Or you bug the ambassador. You'll feel like you just took a risk and won big. Then you'll feel like you can spend 30 seconds performing an action that will lower your profile. You'll begin to realize the kind of amazing depth this game has.\n\nI bought this at $15, but even at $25, this is some of the best value you'll ever get out of a video game if the style appeals to you. It's even more fun with friends!\n\nIf you enjoy games like Town of Salem, Throne of Lies, Epic Mafia, Secret Hitler, etc, I strongly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1523889501, "timestamp_updated": 1523889501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41523207": {"recommendationid": "41523207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070712973", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 540, "last_played": 1575758119}, "language": "english", "review": "n.b I'm a beta player who's just connected their Steam account, so my playtime is significantly more than shown.\n\nThis game is a real gem. An instant classic. Not only is it truly unique and captivating but it's executed excellently. I never knew how much fun it could be pretending to be an NPC! There's nice variety in the missions too, with some much harder than others (this in itself lends to some interesting meta gameplay).\n\nThe 'beginner mode' (which limits the missions and venues available) is actually quite hard for the spy, (I feel it's more about teaching you how to be a sniper) but once you move through to the more complete game it becomes much more balanced and challening; as a sniper once you're looking for any 4 of 7 missions being completed somewhere like the library then it becomes pretty overwhelming! It's one of those rare, well balanced games where you feel at a disadvantage, no matter what side you're on! Very thrilling gameplay considering how bland the activities :)\n\nA special mention for the community too, which is friendly and well natured.

Probably the most unique multiplayer game I have played in awhile.\n\nOne player is the sniper (with only one bullet, so make your shot count!) and the other player is the spy (trying to do objectives and not get the snipers attention. Sounds simple, but the mind games and the gameplay is fantastic and a real rush. The game also has what might be one of the best communities I have come across in my 30+ years of gaming. So far EVERYONE has been nice and helpful to me as a new player, this is very rare in this day and age to see.\n\nOne game I had two people marked, I was 100% sure it was one of them. But I wasn't sure which one! I also had the option of waiting for time to run out if I didn't think he finished the objectives. So I took a chance and shot one of the two I had marked, it was the other one! At the end it shows that it was one of the guys i had marked BUT he didn't even finish the missions! I could have just waited a few more seconds for the time to run out and I woudl have run! But I had this feeling like I had to take the shot, I knew it was one of them. What touch decisions!\n\nAnother time I beat a guy who had a bunch of wins within the first 10 seconds of me playing as sniper. What a rush! The other games we had where much closer and he probably took it easy on me a bit but boy, that early detective work as the sniper sure worked good and felt great. A game where you have to outsmart your opponent! Mind vs mind, instead of being more about how fast you can move or aim or shoot, people have to really think and be smart in this one. \n\nGames can play out in many different ways, I have only done about 15 games so far but I am already in love with this game. The game is also not finished yet! Can't wait to see what gets added in the future to this wonderful and unique indie game that is fun vs random's and vs friends. I woudl suggest checking out some twitch streams of the game, that go tme interested in the game and the ideas it brings to the table. Nice work devs and keep up the good work!\n\nNow let me get back to improving my spy work (I thought I was going to be so much better as spy, but I sure was wrong haha, I have had a few people say how good I am at sniper, even early on. It is also in pretty good shape to, other than a few bugs and a little lag in one game, it has been a wonderful experience and a game I will comeback to very often in the future (especially if some of my good friends pick this up. I can see some epic and funny gaming nights with friends on this game in the future lol). It is really nice to see a game take a unique stab at something new, especially with all these modern games copying something or other, trying to be the next big thing. Spy Party is good ol' fashioned fun! One of the best 1vs1 games I have ever played, it really makes you think differently than you are use to with most games.\n\nDear friends, can you please get this game?

Let me tell you why it's worth $25.\n\nThis game is so simple in its premise, it's almost misleading.  SpyParty is incredibly deep once you jump into [i] experienced [/i] mode.  I've been playing this game since 2013 before it hit Steam, and I have around 268 hours.  That still blows my mind, but every time I play, there's always something new I learn or something I know I can do better.\n\nI've seen people argue that the novelty will wear off, and they're right.  But that does not diminish the amount of tension and strategy in the game's design, and it certainly doesn't lessen my experience and enjoyment of the game.  Every single opponent is different, their playstyles and strategies are different, and thus I always have to adapt to my opponent.  So I want to emphasize this is not just a game of Guess Who.  This is a game about watching for subtle cues, getting into your opponent's mind, and outsmarting them.  It can be intimidating for a new player, trust me, I know.  The game has a steep learning curve for experienced mode, [i] and [/i] a high skill ceiling.  But the community is super welcoming and will answer literally any question you have.\n\nIs it worth $25?  If you are willing to put your time into it, absolutely yes.  For those who still aren't convinced, I highly encourage people to go to the official SpyParty Twitch channel to watch high-level SpyParty get casted.

And what a challenge. At first glance, its EZPZ. You'll jump into a mode where you learn 4 missions and play other people with just about the same number of games and play. You'll play until you kind of figure out what you're playing and then your world expands; A LOT. You get access to 4 other missions and the sniper has to look for more. \n\nThe more you play, the more you realize you need to be like the AI to succeed. Yes, you need to do missions but it takes SOOO much skill to know how to be an AI and not get shot by the top players of this game. I have >9000 games played and it still doesn't cease to teach me new things about the game each time I die.\n\nIf the time I spent in game were divided by the $30 I've spent on Spyparty, I'd be spending $0.05/24 hours. I think thats pretty good value. If you come online and ask a question, I do not doubt that you will get at least 3 answers trying to help you solve your issue. \n\nThough this game has been in production for a long time, updates are constantly coming out, and there are a lot of plans for what is still to come. You can get it now, or when it comes out officially later, but I am really excited to see all the developments of this game. \n\nTL;DR: It takes a lot of work to get good and I really like this game and am excited to see where it goes.\n\nPros: \n- Exciting skill curve- it takes a lot of experience to get really good at this game\n- Different than any other game I've ever played. \n- Re-playability is fantastic- Though you may think that its really simple to figure out to start, I challenge you to play against someone with over 6000 games. \n- The maps are beautiful and are fun to explore.\n\nCons:\n- Exciting Skill curve- its not the most accessible game. If you're not up to putting time into the game, you won't find its depth. \n- The process that takes this game to come out may take a while- Since its a one man dev team with one artist, it's going to take some time for this game to fully come out. Though this is the case, Chris Hecker is absolutely dedicated to this game and is a perfectionist in how he does things.", "timestamp_created": 1523693820, "timestamp_updated": 1523694006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.69232553243637085", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41475885": {"recommendationid": "41475885", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962235757", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 47964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1569529875}, "language": "english", "review": "Congratulations.

The replay system even still loads my replays from 2014 (looking at you PUBG that has constantly broken old replays). You can spectate live games and even practice sniper by sniping against a live game. This \"early access\" game has more polish than many full-release games I've seen and the developer really, truly cares about feedback.\n\nSome tips for newbies:\n\n1) Don't be discouraged if you lose at the beginning. This game can be hard. Chatting with your opponent and reviewing the replay can teach you a TON.\n2) Ask questions in the game lobby! People are generally willing to help out and answer anything you need to know.\n3) Once the sniper begins to win around 100% of the time, it's time for you to move on to Intermediate mode which unlocks more missions.

This is a deep, competitive game with real potential as an e-sport.\n\nIn my time with SpyParty it's come a long way, with new missions and features, and a complete art overhaul with 10 maps and 21 characters.
