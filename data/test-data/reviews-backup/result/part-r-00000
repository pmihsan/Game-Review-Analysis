100002927	Good Job for Early Access. Need a lot develop in future. Work hard dev team. ♥	----->	-1
100004740	I've watched this go from basically an alpha prototype to a very decent game. The pace is good, interesting without being frantic. If you play on the slowest speed you could even call it serene. It has enough complexity and progress to be interesting without being a numbers-heavy micromanagement factory simulator. The progression of unlockable things is mostly good, though a bit unbalanced and mystifying here and there. The simulated village is really well-designed and runs well, though part of the game is that you can gradually dig yourself into a supply-chain or economic hole that it can be easier to restart than get out of. The quest and military systems are still pretty vestigial. The UI recently got an overhaul and looks and feels very nice. If not a tutorial, it would be really good to have some in-game documentation for each building/need/concept, that also lets us know generally how close or far away things need to be from each other. This is the kind of stuff that seems really obvious when you've been living with designing and balancing it all, but players will make all different kinds of assumptions about and end up frustrated. If you like city simulators that start out simple and slowly build up, this is one of my favorites of the genre.	----->	16

100061928	This game is a little on the old side. I bought this a few years ago because I saw some big YouTubers play it and it looked fun. This game is perfect if you want to have some playful fun with some friends, do some fun missions, and try and outsmart your sniper. Both sides are pretty well balanced (well there isn't really much to balance, but still, no one side has a distinct advantage over the other). Playing both sides is really fun and you do tend to pick up on the NPC's movements, then someone Banana Bread's you and all of your suspects are outside the circles.I highly recommend this game not only for the gameplay, but because the developers are a small knit group, and still have a decent following because of this game.	----->	22

100078091	One of the best building / economy simulations I know. It's cute, it's complex, it's fun. I play the Early Access version since years now and it gets better and better with each release. And what's more: there are already dozens of really interesting mods out there on foundation,mod.ioI'd say Foundation is well worth the money!	----->	11

100186650	I have enjoyed this game during early access.  I would like to see more challenges besides just sending goods or troops, but beside that it's a cute city builder.  I like that there is no grid, and the roads being created from where the people walk is nice.	----->	5

100646174	This game, for being in Alpha, is in really good shape. Needs some balancing but it plays well and it looks good. So far it isn't very demanding, balance will help bring it around some. Don't expect your people to be happy all the time, there seems to be a certain formula that keeps them from complaining about finding suitable locations for housing, they are pretty picky. I'm enjoying the game and the stress-free play it provides.	----->	12

100695260	One of the better medieval colony sims I've played recently. I really like the graphics and visuals, and I like that you can designate spots for villagers to build their own houses instead of having to build each house. It's pretty great.The best part is that they're dedicated to improving the game, new content, features, and fixes have been coming in strong. For an early access game, this is handled very well.	----->	14

But that is just the nature of early access. My only slight frustration is the default controls are a little odd coming from other city builders and I'm happy to change them but one of the few locked key bindings is the one that i want to change. Just let me pan with middle click. please.	----->	1

101307738	The masters of puzzles! Plenty of interesting, brain-twisting but at the same time fun puzzles, accompanied by great aesthetics and ambient. Levels take time to fully complete and even after that there's more to look for in the Community Rooms section where players can create custom rooms and share them with others. I've been playing solo, but I'm sure it's even more fun solving puzzles alongside company. Great work!	----->	13
101308625	Awesome game.Great graphics/physics and sound effects with a well designed UI.Varied scenarios and all well thoughtout puzzles.The editor is very easy to use overall, but extremely powerful with what you can achieve with it, as regards the logic.The possibilities are endless for user created material, and the devs have more updates planned too.	----->	3

101315877	Finished the first 2 locations (10 maps) everything ran smooth and it was a lot of fun with 2 friends. No disconnect or desyncs. Steam friend-list works perfectly.I only had a quick looks through the ingame level editor but it seems to be very fully featured. Cant wait to give it a try.	----->	4
101320016	Very fun puzzle game! The only thing lacking is FORCED co-op, where teammates must work together in order to solve the puzzles, currently all puzzles can be done by 1 person. I look forward to see what community maps come from this! First level took about 1 hour (8 rooms I think), if the others last as long it was well worth the $15, especially with community made maps.	----->	7
101324836	Exactly what one could want in a co-op puzzle game.  Great fun with friends, well worth the price.  Huge credit to the devs for building in a workshop feature!  While only 15 rooms are built into the base game, community updates will undoubtedly provide many more hours of fun.	----->	7
101325496	This game is so amazing! If you are super into escape rooms, this is a great fix to do it online with your friends. The puzzles are challenging but just difficult enough for you to solve. I really hope they add in more levels!	----->	6

101372078	Got this game the first day it came out, and while I can be very picky about these sorts of games, Escape Simulator managed to scratch that intellectual itch left behind by real life escape rooms. The puzzles are interesting and require some thought, while being easy enough so that it is accessible and solvable by all sorts of players. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes escape rooms or puzzles in general. For those who already own the game, best of luck on your escape!	----->	11
101372613	Game is good, there are enough distractions (irrelevant but interactive items) in the game to keep it feel realistic thanks to being 3D. Community made rooms should provide the missing difficulty and give more play time. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.However, don't buy if you have 3D motion sickness like me. The game is purely first person and I don't think it is viable to add a 3rd person view since the you play in a small confined space which makes it difficult to aim if in 3rd person view.	----->	1

101415711	Honestly i love escape room and i was super hype for this game to come out. So far there are only 15 rooms plus all the community rooms. For a little under $15 i wish it had more but it is just the start. I don't know if they said they are going to add more rooms or not in said future but i hope they do. The game is off to a good start.	----->	11
101415731	Ok, ngl but this game is pretty awesome!	----->	1
101416351	I love escape rooms.  And I've tried more than few digital version (most notably The Room series.)  But the key difference between those games and Escape Simulator is The Room always just boils down to a pixel hunt.  Escape Simulator does a much better job of actually recreating what you might experience in a real life escape room, just digitally.  I look forward to playing more and the concept of steam workshop support is a real game changer.	----->	5

101455247	its really enjoyable and fun to just build ahead of time and let the npc's build there homes	----->	4
101461689	Great game, was looking for something like this for a while. Not much community content yet, but I'm definitely looking forward to playing some great custom maps in the future!	----->	5

101486478	This game is incredible, I have played many escape room games, this is by far the best, with a room editor, to make your own and play others, extremely well made and difficult base escape rooms , incredibly polished, great aspects and great puzzles, highly recommend, especially with friends!	----->	3
101501260	Easiest way it can be put, a smooth, satisfying puzzle game that allows for seamless co-op and a fantastic level editor. Truly a fantastic game that has a world of potential.Highly recommend for anyone remotely interested in puzzles.	----->	12
101501271	One of the few puzzle games that are actually fun. Puzzles are not too tough nor too straightforward.Community created rooms are also a great plus!9/10	----->	3
101501311	Very promising game, Love the editor!	----->	0
101501353	The best Escape game for both Solo and Co-op category. The graphics and game-play for this price is absolutely outstanding and the infinite potential with community maps is worth it. Would recommend 10/10.	----->	12
101501644	the potential to make your own levels, and experience others, gives it great replay value	----->	3
101501702	I'm an escape room enthusiast, and this game has everything I love.Room editor has all basic functions I need to create my first escape room (yay), and the devs are working hard to add more features.	----->	-3
101502510	Excellent game with loads of potential!Great to play in coop and plenty for each person to work both independently and cooperatively!Workshop content being released and the editor are a great feature to this game which will provide endless content and keep you immersed in the puzzles and stories to offer.Really enjoy Escape Simulator and excited to see where it goes!	----->	8
101502724	Played with a friend, we spent about 4 hours playing through the pre-built rooms, it was fun, but what I am really interested in is the room creator, It is currently quire basic, but works and there are plans to upgrade it, I am all for it. the workshop maps have already proven the creativity of people, and I cannot wait for more	----->	2
101503288	I personally think this game is everything an escape simulator game should be, it only took me 8 hours in total to 100% complete it with all achievements but i'm sure there is more to come, the puzzles are perfect and genuinely remind me what it's like to do an actual escape room, the controls i'm actually impressed with, most other escape games feel clunkly and rigid and usually are the reason i quit the game but this game got it right, all the features/achievements/puzzles/controls/builder mode and whatever else there is, is all top notch and i think they did a great job with it, genuinely cant wait for more rooms to come out 100% reccomend.	----->	10
101503902	Great game, haven't experience any bugs in the first few rooms. It works smooth, and having community maps is an awesome feature. Definitely worth the money!	----->	6
101503919	This game was very enjoyable. There were some rooms that were very difficult and others that were pretty simple to beat. At times there were items that disappeared through the floor so we had to restart the room. Also added an option for the community to create rooms is also cool! I played two community rooms and they were well done. Hopefully there will be more official rooms and community rooms to play. I recommend this if you have a friend to play with and enjoy puzzles.	----->	3
101505170	Great game.  Gets a little old towards the end game.	----->	0
101505630	Not much needs to be said about this game, other than amazing! The devs truly captured the essence of how escape rooms work. The difficulty of the puzzles are never too complex or too easy. The game's soundtrack is also very fitting to the stages and the urgency of your situation. Highly recommend this to everyone!	----->	1
101506742	its really fun	----->	4
101507461	good escape room game. offical maps good. workshop one hit and miss atm. but asume gonna be lot better when map makers get used with tools	----->	2
101508070	As an escape room enthusiast, this game was a DREAM COME TRUE! The graphics are beautiful, the puzzles are fun, and the interface is pleasant (although I haven't tried multiplayer yet). Controls took some time to get used to FYI.	----->	2
101512187	Fun game!	----->	0
101512235	I did play Golf with your friends, but not having the possibility to play custom maps was the reason to switch to Golf it. It is a really good game to switch to if you are bored but i would never play it for more than one hour.	----->	1
101513274	fun game	----->	4
101513316	Good game. 100% would recommend for a chill weekend game.	----->	2
101517364	Super fun game to play with both friends and solo. Way better than just running escape rooms on vrchat lol	----->	8
101517640	A rather interesting game in which you are placed in a small room and have to solve puzzles in. Can see why they suggest 2-3 players as the room is rather small and can get crowded pretty easily with only two players. I would suggest giving it a try with a friend and seeing if you enjoy it. One of the puzzles in the first theme did require two players to solve so it seems like solo is impossible. Unsure if its just because it had co-op puzzles due to being in a co-op or if that was the default experience.	----->	9

101547337	Love this game.  Controls get some getting used to but it's not a horrible hurdle to get over.  It's just a same that this isn't VR.  This would go from good to great with VR.	----->	3

101555206	Great and fun co-op game. the puzzle difficulty is just right. the interactivity with the environment is good (you can pickup some objects, throw them, inspect them together with co-op friends, but some object can only be drag around). Looking forward for the new level update from the developer and high quality workshop level from the community. I hope the developer would expand the capability of the level editor to facilitate that.Update :Ok, so the additional 58 hours since the first review was mostly (80%-90%) consisted of me trying to play around with the editor and eventually created a level in the workshop which you can find here :https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2642605827The editor is good enough to create a good level, as evident in a lot of great levels on the workshop made by the community. Though I miss some of important basic function that is suppose to be there, like audio cue, the ability to import new 3D objects (ok maybe this is not so basic) and easier way to put our own custom texture. I still think this game have a great value, with the developer keep releasing new rooms and the excellent rooms created by the community. I definitely recommend this game to escape room or puzzle enthusiasts in general .	----->	29

101564523	I have to say this game was pretty fun to go through, especially as a person who really loves escape rooms. The puzzles and detail just fit so well together, and was super fun to play. The only 2 things I would've enjoyed is 1: make the puzzles in the space themed rooms more clear, as some of them were a huge pain to go through (especially that molecule puzzle, the instructions were super unclear and was just tedious to go through)2: why does this game only let people use a flimsy room creator to make rooms? why let the game limit itself? I have to say they really could've done better when making the workshop for this game as it looks pretty limited, if they just let people add whatever they want, then rooms from the workshop may be more spectacular than they are now. One example would be ktane (keep talking and nobody explodes), a game where you have to defuse a bomb by having someone else tell you instructions for solving various modules. It didn't do so well at first, with there being only 14 modules that were kinda boring as time went on, but once they opened up their workshop, that drove people to make some super cool modules! Some of these modules included ciphers, puzzles, missions, and stuff I didn't even know was possible when it came to the workshop! I just feel like if we could do the same for this game (aka make the room creator thing more open when it comes to creating stuff and allowing new mechanics like scripting), then perhaps this community will grow stronger and better!Let me know what you guys think in the comments of this post, thank you.	----->	25

101582999	Love this game. Bought everything escape related on Steam and this co-op one is truly a gem! Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a brain teaser.

101586604	VERY ORGANIC FEEL=================Relax, chill, play at x1 speed, follow the peasants around, wave to the King (or flip the bird-he won't understand)You place the structures and the commoners will find their way to/from. If you want them walking in a certain path, then set up fence lines (they will take 1-5 minutes before they respect them)Go ahead and use a few mods, you will only enhance your enjoyment.Save Mile Markers, as a new Save, incase you want to rollback, or revise (but you can do that naturally as the growth progress'	----->	5

101599149	Great escape room game, the base game provided 4 hours of fun for the 100%. Puzzles are on the easier side but I'd rather that over being stumped by some obtuse puzzle that makes no sense.

101650931	So far its really fun! It seems limited in official maps. Its honestly super basic. But that is almost the best part about it.. No bloat at all. Its a simple put put game that just works great. The user made maps are cool too! The only thing I feel is lacking is it could use a teeny bit of polish graphically.  But if the that's the trade off for no BS. Ill take it. 	----->	5
101652472	its a nice and fun game. Recommend	----->	7
101654582	This is game is amazing, it is so much fun to play. Personally I love Escape Rooms, and playing with friends, co-operating and having a bonding experience whilst each of us tries to see the puzzles through his own POV. I played alongside 2 friends the Egyptian themed and the Mansion in one sitting. We also tried one community map, and tbh having community maps is an awesome idea for this game to grow.You actually get the vibe that you are in an escape room, the puzzles are great, you feel the time pressure (if you want the trophy), you get to think outside the box.The graphics of the game are beautiful, and you should remember that it is a game designed for basically every computer. The minimum requirements are ridiculous, even my terrible PC can handle them.I truly recommend you to buy this game, play with friends (3 people in a room is more than fine), have some time, laugh, get upset at not being able to solve it, etc. It's a great game.	----->	11
101655156	Bought it to play with my girlfriend. We both really enjoy the game! Will definitively be playing more. 3 main themes (Mansion, Space, Egyptian) with 5 rooms in each. Plus there is the steam workshop where people can make rooms or you can make a room!	----->	2

101663435	A promising start, but a long way to go before this game is complete. I like the customizable building system and the pacing. I'm looking forward to playing again after a few new updates, which it seems like are slow to come out. A few things I'd like to see in the future: - more import placed on building a military and defence. Right now, walls are free and armies can only fight in off-screen foreign battles. However, this is a good income source.- improvement to the system that builds houses. sometimes, I would delete a house while building a market planing a district and then that area would never be built on again no matter the zoning. - taverns seem pretty useless right now and cost more than they make; almost no one used either of the 2 taverns in my city with 400+ commoners, 100+ citizens.- more entertainment options for citizens- gates to match each type of wall; a special wall type to defend rivers would be nice too- giant gate should be allowed to be made multiple times so I can offer multiple entrances to my city- more raw resources and crafting trees for those resources- evolving relationships with other cities- more neighboring cities and trade routes that scale with how much you're able to trade- more options for religious symbols. Only a cross available- would like if I could alter the number of arches in stones bridges could center them over rivers while still maintaining the end points that I want.	----->	14

The game is very well made overall. It would be amazing if they added VR to this game, I would get a headset just for this game alone. My one complaint would be that the character models seem a bit cartoony compared to the rest of the game.	----->	6

101695115	Just started playing this with my wife and we love it! Really engaging - feels just like an escape room! The editor is a little hard to use and has a few spelling mistakes (shock horror) but all in all this is excellent. Note: it does not yet have controller support..	----->	1

101713313	An escape room game. I really like the puzzles in this one, they are not extremely difficult but sometimes u miss something and when u see the hint u feel like an idiot for missing that. love the game. Also there are rooms that are made by the community so even more content. 10/10	----->	-2
101715267	Very fun city builder, I like that it's not set in the modern era like Cities Skylines for example. This game truly is a breath of fresh air.	----->	9
101717210	Send help. I've gotten obsessed with making my own rooms. (I love puzzles in general, and this really took my fix I had after the We were here Franchise)	----->	5
101718271	Amazing. The base rooms are great, with a lot of detail and interactivity. I'm looking forward to the workshop rooms!	----->	0
101719942	Foundation is a charming city builder which underscores the economic complexities of urbanization in a medieval society. Most of the game's difficulty lies in managing chains of extraction and refinement to meet the needs of your people. As such it's more than sufficient as a sandbox builder, though offers little in the way of challenge. While you will likely suffer set backs that stall out your progress, it's very unlikely that you will end up losing your investments or assets permanently (aside from tactically doing so yourself). In its current state Foundation is an incredibly chill experience and well suited for a relaxing evening. Even as an alpha, I find the experience intriguing enough that I would heartily recommend the game.	----->	1
101719996	Lovely game. The base rooms are great I hope they add more. The comunity ones are okay, some are kind of wierd and anoying at times. Overal if you love puzle games, escape rooms etc youl love this game!	----->	12
101724349	The escape rooms are fun, some of them are really challenging. I was able to beat the game in an afternoon, however there are a bunch of workshop rooms and I'm sure they will add more official rooms as well. If you like escape rooms and puzzles, definitely give this game a try!	----->	0
101725547	An escape room game that can be played single player or co-op and is purely worth it for the built in editor which is getting better and better.	----->	3

101729648	Very fun game. Super fun to play with another person. Only con is this is the first and only game I have ever played that I get motion sickness and nauseated while playing. I'm not sure if it's a motion blur issue or whatever but it needs to be fixed ASAP. Whenever the motion sickness issue is resolved this will be an amazing game!	----->	14
101730110	If you like Escape Rooms, or just puzzle solving in general, Escape Simulator is fantastic! The only element I've yet to test is the multiplayer, but the puzzles themselves are great and the steam workshop compatibility is incredible! Their puzzle builder is logical and easy enough to understand yet complicated enough to allow for complex puzzle design, and they're still working on it and adding additional features. Definitely worth your money.	----->	10

101766594	After just 5 hours I was done with the base content of the game and moved on to doing community maps. I found most of the puzzles to be a little lack luster and pretty easy, I didn't get a huge sense of accomplishment after rooms because they were normally mostly straight-forward. There were a couple of rooms that broke when tasks were done in a weird order and objects could no longer be interacted with. Generally though I liked the experience and think it's worth the money, especially if the community maps grow.	----->	0

101771057	Apparently I cannot recommend the game without writing something.  So, here you go.	----->	2
101772278	Its a game similar to The Room series or Myst. It trades the Edritch/Lovecraftian horror or unspoken mystery themes for a more optimistic, cooperative gleam. That is if you consider the idea of colonialist grave robbers, and Victorian-era quack shrinks to be optimistic. If you like physical escape rooms or puzzles in general this game may be for you.	----->	-1

101802822	One of the best escape room games, supports co-op and has a workshop as well for custom maps! I hope the devs keep adding new features to it because this game has huge potential.	----->	7

101813406	Absolutely amazing gameplay, I have a mac and my partner has a PC and we've had hours of date night fun with this game. I'm obsessed with puzzle games and we both love teaming up for escape rooms irl and this game captures it perfectly.	----->	12
101816328	While I haven't played Foundation in a while, I can still remember when I decided to play it even when Ghost of Tsushima was released (a game I was super hyped to play at the time).I'm waiting for some more updates before I get back to it, but I must say it is a great game, even in Early Access! It does have some flaws, but I'm sure the team will fix everything before the official release.	----->	6
101821041	If you like sims, this one is unique. It requires some strategy and balancing between the towns folk and their needs so it presents a nice challenge. The models are cute. The people do not blink. LOL. (apparently, this bothers some people) Supports community mods. 	----->	3

101830908	This beautiful game keeps getting better and better. I love spending hours watching my villagers slowly go about their lives and build up their settlements from burgeoning hamlet to bustling towns. There is a bit of a steep learning curve to make things run smoothly which can lead a new player to some frustrating dead ends but once you get a hang of it, the game has just enough challenges to keep it interesting. The mods aren't a must but they make the game extra spectacular and all the more challenging. On that note, one of my favourite things about Foundation is its amazing community. I learned about the game streaming Let's Plays on YouTube and I expanded my playing style and city designs thanks to the great examples shared on the community Discord. Loving the updates and can't wait to see Foundation get even cooler!	----->	13

101843759	A fun and challenging escape room simulator. Playing with a friend is a great way to enjoy this game as long as your able to work together. In some rooms it was such a puzzle that without someone else looking at the same situation a different way you could be stuck in that room forever. Looking forward to more rooms to escape from soon!	----->	5
101844740	I love city building games and have played my fair share, and Foundation is similar enough to the classic city builders to be comfortable but different enough to be engaging.

101917012	I think this is a great game and would definitely recommend it. Only problem I have encountered is that once you get your town/city established, the only way to find iron ore is to locate a mineral which is often very far away. There is no building that can produce it and you can not trade for it either which I find a little frustrating. Other than that though, fantastic game and one that I will continue to play.	----->	6

101918366	Great game, would definitely recommend if you love real escape rooms and want to enjoy some co-op fun! One of a kind, great deal for the price and workshop rooms can extend total play time, well done! :)	----->	11
101919216	This game has a potential for a super high ceiling. Even now i think it is definitely worth its listing price. The campaign maps alone are worth 8 or so hours of content (more to come in the future). Community maps are solid and can be even greater with more mechanics/props added to the sandbox. If the Devs stay engaged with the community, the game can have endless replay value.	----->	10

101994657	[h1]Awesome![/h1][b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]Online co-op.Community-made levels supported by Steam Workshop.Neat mechanics and interactive parts. The level editor is pretty well made. Moving, scaling, painting, adjusting mechanics, etc is a smooth operation. Object selection is quite diverse with the amount you can place down (feels like they're always adding more with each update).[b][u]Cons (more of a middle ground):[/u][/b]The editor can be a little limited at times with what you can do compared to the built-in levels. However, it appears with each update, the editor is getting more refined than ever and enjoyable to construct the mechanics, objects, and textures you seek to create.[b][u]In the End:[/u][/b]Escape Simulator is a superb experience and your mind will be blown away with the creativity you'll stumble upon and even create yourself.The devs are definitely taking care of their game with updates and patches.[b]I'd strongly recommend this game!

The cartoony style and bite sized chunks of levels make this a perfect game to pick up, relax with for twenty minutes, and put back down. I love that in a time where games are often designed to be a slog.Hopefully the developers keep adding content, but even as is I'd recommend it for the price.	----->	13

102115635	Whoever thought this was a good idea, deserves one hell of a raise cause it's a really good idea. The escape rooms are challenging enough to where you might need more than 1 person just to figure the clues out.

102139668	Fun escape room simulator, puzzles are fun but not impossible. The tutorial is NOT a reflection of the puzzle difficulty of the rest of the game thankfully, as I was a little worried it was going to be ridiculously easy based on that. It seems like the developers are adding new content and there is there ability to build your own room/ play other peoples' creations, giving you even more to play through. I haven't played multiplayer yet but I think it will be more fun by having a friend to bounce ideas off.	----->	9

102198677	This is a recently released game so you can understand the minimal content at this point, but to counter this they've enabled the community to create their own puzzles. Whilst they may be way more confusing than the ones created by Pine Studios, it still allows for a level of replayability - Although still mad at the fact i could never find that last token on every single level. Regardless of this i still got a good 5 hours out of the game before finishing all of the provided levels. It's a good game in its simplicity and i would happily come back to play any new levels they create in the future.	----->	1

102208871	There's something charming about Foundations presentation. When it was first released the fact that your peons created their own paths based on where they walk, it was revolutionary... now every game and their gran does it. But Foundation does it really well and all the mechanics work great together.Apart from the basic buildings and production chains, your asked to build customised churches, forts and government buildings. The controls to do this are simple and the result is always rewarding. There's also a little bit of light trade and soldier training, but you won't see any of the action.It can be a fairly relaxing game (so long as you keep picking those berries!) and definitely appeals to those who like to make a pretty city and not just a practical one.	----->	9

102235711	The escape rooms on their own felt worth the price.  The room editor with unlimited rooms from other players makes this game a gold mine of replayability.	----->	1
102238328	Pretty fun to play with friends, the price seems reasonable but needs more content to continue playing game. The quality of the workshop levels weren't any better than the official game levels because they had less features to create a perfect theme and finalized quality that we can really enjoy, and missing sound effects and wrong information about the item description made the puzzles a bit confusing.For the further updates, the level editor should be better. I also think that a single theme of official levels should be harder to complete and include more space to move around and explore, which would possibly make people to be confused of finding clues around more rooms to solve a single puzzle.The game still provides free updates, so I think this isn't that bad than it actually looks right now as an early game.	----->	2

102291544	Escape rooms are an incredibly fun activity which is even better with friends and it's honestly a wonder why a game like this didn't already exist. This is a collection of 16 bite-sized escape rooms, each 15 minutes and totally distinct while also giving every set of five levels a story. It's hardly incredible story-wise, but that's not why you're probably here. Playing through this was a blast and the workshop means there's as many levels as the community cares to create. Pick this up, it's short right now but will soon be updated with more content.	----->	9
102294690	I am having a blast with Escape Simulator!  The rooms are all just enough of a challenge without being so hard I want to give up.  The tokens make each room re-playable.  I've played solo and I've teamed up with the friend who introduced me to escape rooms.  Both ways are enjoyable and if I'm having trouble with a puzzle, teaming up is a surefire way to work through it.  I love that there are community designed rooms, though I haven't had a chance to play those yet.  Something to look forward to.  I liked the fact that I could demo the game to see if I liked it (and that co-op mode worked in the demo).  The demo was just enough of a taste that I was sold on it.As for things that I don't like... I usually have to start the game, close it and restart it because it's always glitchy the first time it loads up.  That may be due to my PC, though.  We haven't had to use many hints, but when we did they were a mix of helpful and not really helpful at all (and the community rooms don't have them).I don't play a lot of video games because they are hard on my hands, but this is one I can definitely play.  If you enjoy puzzles, mind games, and real-life escape rooms, you should definitely try out the free demo to see if this is something you'll enjoy.My initial review (above) was afetr playing 12.3 hours.  I have now played an additional 130.  I've played all the Pine rooms as well as 70+ community rooms, and I love them all.  There are amazing room builders in this community, designing excellent and intriguing rooms for us to play.  I did try building a room early on, but had some trouble and gave up.  I'd like to give it another try in the future.Still totally recommend Escape Simulator to anyone who enjoys puzzle games and in-person escape rooms.	----->	23

102306727	If you like puzzles, this game is definitely worth the $15, even better if you can find it at a discount. Some of these were really hard, and some of them were pretty easy. Finished all of it in one session because we couldn't stop playing.	----->	6
102306834	At first, I thought this game would be a normal quick puzzle game that my friends and I could complete in under an hour. I was pleasantly surprised that this game took a lot of brain power to play. Each room level was vastly different which made it really challenging for my group. Would definitely recommend this game to people that are down for a challenge. P.S. If you are playing with someone dumb, accept that he/she is not going to do anything. Recommend having 3 players cause its likely one won't do anything.	----->	3

102346494	I enjoy playing this game very much.  However as the population increases in the village, houses tend to be built haphazardly and often they block existing access paths to other buildings.  This causes frequent warnings that villagers are unable to reach their destinations.	----->	-1

102364852	This is one of the best golf games I have ever played yet, it really beats the mobile apps hard. So much stuff you can do like creating your own maps & posting it to the workshop, buy skins from the steam market to customise your golf ball's look & many more. I just hope trading cards can get into the scene at some point since I feel that would really set it off to the sky :v. But other than that, graphics look spectacular like a really mini golf course, controllers are a bit wonky it could use some improvement over the sensitivity & game play is absolutely fine and amazing, no issues with bugs or any of that. Keep up the great work Perfuse Entertainment!	----->	15

102402368	This game and I have developed a love-hate relationship. I love it because everything is so well done and thought out that anyone with puzzle skills can complete it. The graphics are beautiful and it's all so clever. I have come to hate it because there are levels that will be made in the simplest of ways, but I will over-complicate it and make myself feel dumb. So I don't actually hate this game. I truly love it and hope that anyone who plays it loves it just as much, if not more.	----->	5

102409582	So it took a bit for me to figure this game out, mostly around the autogenerating housing, but once I did it was just so lovely. Exactly what I was looking for in medieval city building. I wish there was more, I've hit the end of content, but I'm still playing it, pretending like I haven't. The visual style is just superb, I quite enjoy a good zoom in to watch each trade work. Though I have one constructive criticism- please give the villagers eyelids, or move their pupils up, they are so cute but they look super methed out. It's all them herbs, I'm telling you. They have a PROBLEM.	----->	13

102429294	Very fun with a lot of interesting mechanics. Depending on the theme, contributes a lot of elements that you would not expect in your average escape room (chemicals, history, etc). The amount of rooms was a bit underwhelming, but not bad for the price. A couple friends and I beat what was available in about 5-7 hours. Would not recommend the DLC from the community option since they tend to be glitchy and/or or honestly too easy to solve. Found that some objects in the DLCs disappear if you flip them the other way and when placed down they stay upright instead of going flat, which we found to be quite annoying.	----->	4

The environments are also nicely designed, with 3 different themes: Ancient Egypt, Space Shuttle and Victorian - they provide nice vibes to complement the puzzle-solving experience.	----->	9
102470733	Tonkatsu Ramen RecipeIngredients:3 pounds pig trotters, split lengthwise or cut crosswise into 1-inch disks (ask your butcher to do this for you)2 pounds chicken backs and carcasses, skin and excess fat removed2 tablespoons vegetable oil1 large onion, skin on, roughly chopped12 garlic clovesOne 3-inch knob ginger, roughly chopped2 whole leeks, washed and roughly chopped2 dozen scallions, white parts only (reserve greens and light green parts for garnishing finished soup)6 ounces whole mushrooms or mushroom scraps1 pound slab pork fat backDirections1) Place pork and chicken bones in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Place on a burner over high heat and bring to a boil. Remove from heat as soon as boil is reached.2) While pot is heating, heat vegetable oil in a medium cast iron or non-stick skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook, tossing occasionally until deeply charred on most sides, about 15 minutes total. Set aside.3)Once pot has come to a boil, dump water down the drain. Carefully wash all bones under cold running water, removing any bits of dark marrow or coagulated blood. Bones should be uniform grey/white after you've scrubbed them. Use a chopstick to help remove small bits of dark marrow from inside the trotters or near the chicken's spines.4) Return bones to pot along with charred vegetables, leeks, scallion whites, mushrooms, and pork fatback. Top up with cold water. Bring to a rolling boil over high heat, skimming off any scum that appears (this should stop appearing within the first 20 minutes or so). Use a clean sponge or moist paper towels to wipe any black or gray scum off from around the rim of the pot. Reduce heat to a bare simmer and place a heavy lid on top.5) Once the lid is on, check the pot after 15 minutes. It should be at a slow rolling boil. If not, increase or decrease heat slightly to adjust boiling speed. Boil broth until pork fatback is completely tender, about 4 hours. Carefully remove pork fat with a slotted spatula. Transfer fatback to a sealed container and refrigerate until step 7. Return lid to pot and continue cooking until broth is opaque with the texture of light cream, about 6 to 8 hours longer, topping up as necessary to keep bones submerged at all times. If you must leave the pot unattended for an extended period of time, top up the pot and reduce the heat to the lowest setting while you are gone. Return to a boil when you come back and continue cooking, topping up with more water as necessary.6) Once broth is ready, cook over high heat until reduced to around 3 quarts. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a clean pot. Discard solids. For an even cleaner soup, strain again through a chinois or a fine mesh strainer lined with several layers of cheese cloth. Skim liquid fat from top with a ladle and discard.7) Finely chop cooked pork fatback and whisk into finished broth. To serve, season broth with condiments of your choice (salt, soy sauce, miso, sesame paste, grated fresh garlic, chili oil or a mixture of all, for instance) and serve with cooked ramen noodles and toppings as desired.	----->	13

102518350	It's worth picking up if you like puzzles or escape rooms.  I found it a challenge to finish each room the first time through in 15 minutes when playing solo, but that's largely because I kept getting distracted by playing with the environment.  That you don't have to finish in 15 minutes helps if you want to take things more casually.  There aren't many rooms unfortunately, but more are still being added.  The community workshop also has a number of high quality rooms to pick from.Definitely worth the price.	----->	5

102551422	Great game, if you love the niche of escape room games this one is a no-brainer, with a workshop and map editor on launch, the fledgling community has already created a great library of custom content and rooms that's only going to grow.I'm sure the developers will continue adding features both to the core game and to the editor as so far they have been quick to respond and fix issues and bugs so I'm looking forward to what's to come.You get a lot of content for a very small price tag and you won't need to buy another escape room game again!	----->	4

102801238	I've only had the chance to do a few escape rooms in real life, but do tend to gravitate toward puzzle games here on Steam.  I think this game is probably the first 'escape' style game that I've played that actually captures some of the realism from a physical room.I've found the puzzles in here range from the 'easy'/obvious...to the 'oh yeah, I should have seen that sooner'.....to the (*#@%()  that took waaay too much thought, but I'm happy I figured it.....to the ()@$& that!  let's see what the interwebs has on this one.  (Truth be told, I have only turned to the interwebs once, for a solution.  And after not finding it...I went back and figured out the puzzle on my own.)Do I recommend this game?  ABSOLUTELY!!  Especially as it's just in its infancy.  I see a great deal of potential in this game.  Especially with the option of playing co-op with a friend.  AND - the ability to design your own rooms.  (And play ones that others  have designed.)I foresee many many hours ahead enjoying (and suffering minor degrees of frustration) ... the game!Try it!  Trust me!!	----->	11

102809003	It's great, but could be fantastic!I got this game because I am obsessed with all things city builder, management, and creative. Foundation for the most part provides those 3 essentials for me.-Pros-1) no grids-this is huge! I use to hate games without grids, but this game does it right! This feature is extremely helpful given that the villagers build their homes wherever they want (which is a con for me...)2) there's no limit to how many of a certain building you can build (really helpful when your wheat farm is slacking so you build more)3) being able to rename everyone and every building is amazing4) i love the wedges and the small amount of decor you can place (too much decor and you would nearly feel like you're playing SimCity)5) i like that it has a challenging aspect although the game remains extremely easy (the bad weather is the only decent challenge in the game)6) the ability to have mods is nice although i would prefer more detailed DLC's from the developer (i have not downloaded any mods, i am more into DLC's)-Cons-1) starting the game for the first time and reading through the hints, you feel like you got it. Nope! I had to do research many times to figure out key things that i needed information on that wasn't mentioned in the hints)2) i dont like that villagers build their own homes and wherever they want. This really messes up many plans i have for a certain layout with my buildings that i am going for. The comfort need should be our responsibility to build their owns, furthermore making the difficulty more in the game as people scramble for wood and other necessities to build them. (the higher the person, the more in depth of materials needed for their more prestigious home)3) getting money in the game is mainly for when you are starting out and needing something from traders. Some items require weekly costs but i still find i have loads of money and no where to spend them. Traders aren't selling me items anymore so there's that.4) those darn roads disappear on their own-yikes! it takes forever-there should be a tool remover for them5) not enough maps! theres only one decent one-not happy about the mountains on some of the maps-makes no sense really6) pnce youve done all there is, theres nothing left to excite you. maybe opening up a second settlement after reaching a certain milestone with different buildings could be enticing, work your way to leader of the world?7) why even offer gems when they are incredibly hard to mine-they are extremely rare but yet the villagers require them....8) villagers literally need a well, market, and church at every corner they turn or else they are unhappy-not funoverall there are more pros and cons but these stood out the most while writing this-i feel a game that has this much potential should be releasing updates, dlc's, and more to keep the game on going because right now its a standstill when you have nothing else left to achieve.i recommend this game because its relaxing fun but, about 20 hours in and you will want a different game to play.	----->	30

102949259	If you love escape room, this game is one of the best I found on steam. The puzzle is ok, not too hard but not too easy either. But because its new, only few room available. I hope they update it fast. And also I don't know if it happen to everyone else, but playing custom room from community really laggy and sometimes the visualization for stuff kinda weird. I hope the developer would fix the community room rather than just launching it to public like that	----->	11

102975966	Keep in mind, I haven't finished Escape Simulator.I've played a lot of escape room games in the past and this is by far the best one. The puzzles are genuinely very well balanced, not too hard and not too easy. The visual look of the game is wonderful and appealing, and child friendly if you're looking for that. Most escape room games tend to go for a more horror aesthetic so this is a great breath of fresh air. The sound design is definitely one of my favourite parts. Everything sounds really great and natural. Only real complaint is that the library lagged extremely bad [spoiler] (after lighting the fire) [/spoiler] when I was playing with my friends. I'm not sure if it does this in singleplayer as well.	----->	8

103006900	Best basically $10 (with tax and rounding up) I have ever spent. This game gives you and your friends immense happiness and immense blood boiling anger...it's awesome. 10/10 highly recommend!	----->	3
103012217	A stunning puzzle game similar to The Room.  Highly recommend playing with friends. Once completed, there is at the time of writing 600 user created rooms. 9.5/10	----->	6
103013018	25 dollars for a 300 Megabyte game......add more stuff to the game or drop it down to 5 dollars would be my suggestion.Stuff to add: Team VS. 2 snipers vs 2 spies, or 1 sniper spy duo vs another sniper spy duo, or 2 snipers a spy. More maps, more game types other than just kill the spy, add spy vs spy in a sort of counter spy game mode, a train map would be nice. Over all just add more meat and potatoes if you really wanna hustle people with this ridiculous price.TLDR: 25 dollars isn't worth playing the game for a couple hours cause you saw some youtubers play it, or, if you do, dont play more than 2 hours and then just refund it before the 2 week mark, thats what im doing.	----->	-5
103014992	This has to be the best escape room game on steam and in general. The community creations are as fun as the rest of the game is.	----->	6
103021102	This is by far my most favorite city building games.  The ability to customize your buildings is really cool and there are also some really awesome mods for this game as well.  All of the different reasources to manage just overall a really well rounded game.	----->	9
103021118	Already loving it!This game is very fun to play with friends and it is worth this price ;)	----->	8
103046130	This game offers so much freedom to the player. i have really enjoyed spending hours playing with and developing my town. new missions welcome, and more activity with your soldiers	----->	2
103054962	I would recommend with two strong caveats.  One - If you get motion sick, this game will hit you hard.  Something between the camera control and the drag and drop features... hooboy..  I can only play for a few minutes at a time, even with the FOV increased.Secondly, most of the puzzles are great and very intuitive.  Some are not.  Something you'll find with any escape.  I think there's one person on their dev team with whom I share zero inspiration, and each time i encounter one of their puzzles I have zero clue how to proceed.But of the escape games on Steam, this is probably the best, and having a workshop where people can create their own is a huge plus.	----->	6
103060103	Definitely a fun and time consuming game. I think the game does many great things and keeps the player interested in moving forward. My only issues are whenever my village reaches a population of 1000 or more things start to fall apart. The game seems to also get pretty buggy when your village gets to that size. I think there are quality of life issues that need to be addressed. For example I would like to be able to assign warehouses or granaries to specific buildings to keep a good balance of product throughout my village. There comes a point in the game where for example no matter how many berry picking huts you put down your berry stock will always be too low to satisfy the needs of the people. I think the pathing of villagers also needs to be looked at as things get more and more inefficient over time. Repathing should be able to happen naturally or if there was a tool made for the player to help a villager find a better path. The forbidden zone paint brush can only do so much and it can become a headache when your village gets large. It would also be nice to have a building relocation tool as an option especially for villagers who build their houses in awkward locations.I think the trade system between other kingdoms needs a serious makeover. Also I would like to be able to see the production and consumption rate of buildings so I can better balance the needs of industries. Once your village is large (1000+ people) it seems if even one resource production gets off balance a chain effect starts and everything will plummet and your village becomes bricked. I've probably had 7 or 8 1000+ villages so far and they spiraled out of control at about the same point.If the developers continue on their path of adding to the game and tweaking things here and there I think this will become a better and better game over time. I definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys city building and/or resource management.	----->	33

103158508	This game was a ton of fun! I played with my friend and i think we finished the whole thing in one go. What i liked about this game is it isn’t like other puzzle games where most of the solutions are straight forward and easy to find. This game makes you think and put some effort into finding other clues and answers. All of the rooms were very creative and fun! I can’t wait for more content to be released. If you like a good puzzle game that will keep u busy, please get this! 	----->	15

103172801	Awesome escape room experience with tons of puzzles and rooms. Easily accessible and playable. Puzzles are logical and fun.Two minor complaints - rooms are on the small side, meaning with more than 2 players it's probably very, very tight to play and since players can hold objects in inventory, if you don't communicate it can be hard to know people have necessary items.Second complaint is there is too much non-usable stuff and even with a trash to deposit them, it makes for a messy experience that obscure items.These are MINOR complaints. This game is awesome.	----->	-2

103563182	Visual Style 2021 winner, all the way! ❤The art-style here is so lovely, pleasant and will always draw your eyes to where its hot puzzle action is hidden.The very stylized (yet believable) locations and rooms are consistently varied, intriguing and comfortably whimsical throughout.I haven't seen another game use an art style like this one yet: and for looking this distinct, while managing to make the absolute most of this styles many strengths, in focused, masterfully crafted, room scale adventures, I definitively say it deserves to win this award!	----->	10
103563186	My love for this game is completely unhealthy and dominates my computer life when rooms become available to the point where I am falling asleep at my desk playing (Disregard I have only played for 9 hours, the replay-ability even after a few months is there). I play with a friend of mine, and the rooms are HARD. Finishing the room within the limited amount of time can get stressful, BUT the timer does not stop the game. You can still finish once time is up. And I cannot stress this enough, that there have been ZERO glitches with this game. The controls are very intuitive for what you are trying to accomplish. The graphics are simple, and based upon the difficulty of the tasks, I am glad this is the case. Complicated rendering of environments would hinder moving objects and simple observing needed to find items and clues in the rooms. This is a delicate puzzle solving game. The environments have nooks and crannies that may have the clues you are looking for to open the lock you've been trying to open for the past 5 mins. Even objects you pick up may have a hidden compartment.It is fantastic how successful the developers were at releasing this game. While I would worry about the limited maps  available, the growing player community looks to be adding very fine tuned rooms to play for free.	----->	8

103918635	[h1]Escape Simulator – B+[/h1][b][u]Who This Game is For:[/u][/b]People who enjoy co-op games, co-op games that require thinking and communication, and/or enjoys puzzles and solving riddles.[table]    [tr]        [th][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37839913/]Click Here to Follow My Curator Page for more reviews![/url][/th]    [/tr][b][u]Summary:[/u][/b]If there was a game to be made about escape rooms, this would be exactly how it should be made. This first-person game takes you through 15 or so pre-made levels (with more on the way) where you can interact with objects, examine them, and put clues together to…well, escape the room. Puzzles can range from a minor challenge to insane difficulty. The game can be played fully co-op, which I would highly recommend over single player. And the best feature by far is a built-in level editor with Steam Workshop functionality for custom escape rooms made by the community. Other than some minor gripes, this game is a must-have for people looking for a new game to play together.[i]Disclaimer: The game was played on my main account, so this doesn't have my accurate in-game time.[/i][b][u]BREAKDOWN (Grading Key at the bottom):[/u][/b][b][u]Graphics - B:[/u][/b]The graphics in the game has been developed with a non-realistic, cartoon look. The cartoon style fits it quite well though as the colors are vibrant, distinct, and pop out. This plays well with the different themes they have for the levels and adds to the atmosphere. My biggest issue with the graphics is probably the character design. Being able to customize your character a bit adds some personal touches to each person, but it can be quite jarring. For example, one of my friends made his character’s skin bright red and while looking around the room, the character, who looks like the embodiment of a Hot Tamale, seemed to be staring at me and it hurt my eyes to look at him. Other than that, the skybox and far away textures on some models were not as detailed as the models in front of you. While that doesn’t matter nearly as much in enclosed rooms, the outside levels were affected by it. All in all, I wouldn’t say this was a dealbreaker.[b][u]Gameplay - A-:[/u][/b]Now here is where things get very good. This game does an excellent job of implementing interactive puzzles that you really have to think about, which is the main goal of an escape room. Being plopped into a level with 15 minutes on the clock (finishing in 15 minutes gives an achievement, does not kick you from the level), you and whomever you are playing with must decipher clues from the environment around you and interact with objects to put the pieces together to escape. The ways of interacting with objects are varied and can range from putting certain objects in the correct holes, glossing over the object to decipher symbols and codes, and even pressing buttons or inserting keys into individual objects to unlock an object inside. You can also pick up and hold multiple objects in your inventory, scroll through them, inspect them from your inventory, and chuck them across the room. The puzzles on each of these levels are varied and interesting, even if some of them are near impossible to solve. The rooms in this game are also not randomized, so going into an old one will have those same puzzles. If you reach those impossible puzzles or just have trouble, the game offers a hint system where at the press of a button, a picture with a hint will pop out. The hint system is a little bit behind though, as it doesn’t follow your progress and will give you hints to earlier or completely different puzzles. The Egypt group of pre-made levels has been my favorite so far as it felt so unique and rewarding to figure out the puzzles that stumped me at first. Can proudly say that I used no hints in that group and it felt the best to play of all the levels included in the game.[b][u]Replayability B+:[/u][/b]I am sure you are wondering why I scored replayability so high when rooms are not randomized. Each level has about 8 hidden tokens for you to find and you can go back to look at where they are placed, but that isn’t the reason to come back. The best feature of this game is the built-in level editor and Steam Workshop integration. This means the community can create full escape room scenarios from scratch and upload them for others to play. The best level I have played in this game was a community-made one called “The Miniature Escape” which puts you and a friend in separate rooms where you must describe and work together to solve puzzles on each side of the room. This room/level was one of the best I played in the entire game as it was incredibly unique, well-crafted, and has an emphasis on communication to solve its challenging puzzles. Currently, there are 740+ rooms currently that have been made so far and about 10+ are being added every day. At this rate, there are more than enough community rooms to keep you coming back, along with the ability to create your own for friends, family, or yourself if you get amnesia or forget very easily.[b][u]Multiplayer A+:[/u][/b]This game is probably one of the greatest co-op experiences I have played in recent years, which is great that the entirety of the game can be played in co-op. Since the game is about solving intricate puzzles, communicating and deciphering together are key components of your co-op playthrough and will be integral to solving the tasks at hand. I would say the optimal group is around 2-3 people, but apparently the game can hold a lot more. I don’t remember the last time I had such joy in discussing a piece of paper with my friends and figuring out how the symbols on the page, which correlated with numbers, were added together and in what order. There is also full player clipping, meaning you can walk through your friends’ characters, which is essential in a closed space like a room. Though beware, it could get frustrating if you are solving a puzzle and your friend walks over and stands in front of you, blocking your view of the actual puzzle...I’M TALKING ABOUT YOU, CANDYLORD. It is also nice to throw objects at your friends. Even though it clips through them and doesn’t hurt them at all, you can pretend it actually hit them and there's some joy in that.[b][u]Sound B-:[/u][/b]For the record, I am not a sound guy. I do not claim to be one that investigates sound deeply, so please take this with a grain of salt. My biggest gripe is the music. I am not a fan of the loud overlaying music that are on the stages. After trying the tutorial and Egypt level, turning down the music was a must for me. For what it is worth, the sounds of the objects work and get the job done without taking you out of the experience, but that music will be something I leave off no matter what.[b][u]Developers B+:[/u][/b]I can’t say I have been following the developers or this game for a long time, but I can say from my research, they are fantastic. Not only have they made one of the best speedrunning games out there, “SEUM”, which I played on my friends account but still haven’t bought myself and that needs to change. They have also shown themselves to be willing to accept criticism and understanding of the community's feelings on the game, which is a must. A game’s community is its lifeblood nowadays, so respecting and listening to your community is a very important aspect of game development due to the nature of how games are made now. I believe this developer cares about the community and the enjoyment of the game to them, not just the profits that could be made from it. On top of that, they have plans to add more rooms and have just added some Halloween-themed assets to build your own levels with, as well as a build-a-room competition where the winner got $1,000. So far, I am pleased with the developers.This was my first in-depth review and I hope you guys thought of it as a good read! Thank you!	----->	71

103938545	[h1]The perfect game for escape room addicts[/h1]This game is simply amazing. It is, what the title indicates. An escape room simulator. And it is so much fun to play. Especially with friends.The game already got me with the tutorial. The key bindings are well set, the mechanics are perfectly chosen, and you can already notice how good the game will be. You then get to play the first level (after the quick tutorial level, which is meant to show you how you must work and think in this game, in addition to the “controls-tutorial”). After that, there are 4 themes, with each 5 levels to play. And once you finished that, there is so much downloadable workshop-content. It will never get boring.The art style is cute, and graphics are good.I can already see myself spending hours and hours in this game. I am absolute fanatic of escape rooms and this will satisfy my addiction.	----->	10
103945564	[h1] Good points [/h1]- 15+ Well designed levels to play.- Fun achievements to hunt for 100% completion (no grindy achievements)- Multiplayer. Play with your friends!- A lot of Workshop levels that are really well made as well.- A level editor in game to create your own levels. (You can use custom textures)[h1] Bad Points [/h1]- €15 is on the higher end of what I'd pay the content in this game. But worth for sure when on sale!- Level editor doesn't allow you to play sounds (for when completing a puzzle etc.)	----->	2

103986815	I really like this game. It's awesome to play with a friend. Even though we have extremely low IQ levels it's possible to solve these puzzles. We might be on a level for more then an hour be we do get the job done!	----->	7
103995815	The  game is really nice to play if you got a few hours. It can be a bit confusing here and there and doesn't become more difficult until mid- to late game. Unfortunately there is not much to do at some point. But it's worth its money, definitely. I recommend playing with mods once you are comfortable with the vanilla version. :)	----->	6

104012412	This is an incredibly well put together and adorable little escape room simulator. Definitely a great co-op game for couples or friends. Pros: Surprisingly a good assortment of character creation options Creative and balanced puzzles Easy Co-Op room creation and entry (Don't you hate when Co-Op is weird and takes a min to get into... buh) Super cute graphics with a fun character emote surprise upon completion (It's the little things)Cons: None that I noticed <3 Looking forward to more rooms	----->	9

104029357	Was watching Alice in Borderland and suddenly had the itch to try out puzzle rooms. Coincidentally, this game just came out.Some puzzles are difficult, some are easy. I'd say the game isn't worth the price (yet). Give it a few more maps and it'll be well worth the cost. The fact that there's community-made rooms give it replayability as well.	----->	4
104032190	Very fun game, Creative puzzles and smooth game. would reccomend if you like escape rooms	----->	5
104041482	Honestly, this has been the most fun I've had from a puzzle game ever. The puzzles don't require any obscure outside knowledge or hard math. I had so much fun with it and can't wait for more.	----->	7
104049610	This one was a really fun game to play over a few nights with friends. Highly recommend, puzzles aren't too hard and it's quite funny when you sit there stumped for a minute until one of you suddenly remembers you have something in your pockets... oops. There are a few bugs, twice we had a bug where an item needed to progress a level fell below the floor or wasn't interactable and therefore the level couldn't be progressed. It was no harm, once we realised  we'd have to restart the level and it was pretty quick going to catch up. Don't expect perfection from a game that's only a month old, but this was pretty damn close and the devs are constantly updating the game too!	----->	6
104074864	Great game but it needs more rooms and better co op connectivity!	----->	2
104076074	great to play	----->	3

104117256	One of the coolest Escape Room style games i have played, this game comes as close as it can to real life escape rooms, there are a lot of things you can do with different type of puzzles, workshop content also gives you an endless supply of new rooms to try, many of wich are made by very talented workshop creators!Being able to co op them with friends is awesome too! On top of this the game is priced perfectly, cant go wrong on this one if you like puzzle/escape rooms!	----->	5

104253704	This game was purchased under the guise of it being a fun time. I'll have you know, it did not come as advertised. Nothing made me want to bash my head into the wall repeatedly like having my friends hit me off the map as I was on the cusp of getting in the hole. While I may have gotten a few hole in ones, I also received a few felony one charges as a result. Thazius and Shadow Dragon are the worst and I damn those two to eternally play that damn cube map. May the infinite gravity suspend their belief in a higher power that can save them. But at least you can have cat ears. That was pretty fun.	----->	-7

104488092	Foundation is a pretty straightforward village building game.  I've played others similar, such as Banished, though Foundation focuses more on happiness than survival (frustrated villagers may move away, but they don't appear to ever die).  The mechanics are quite similar otherwise: assign workers to jobs, workers produce goods, workers need homes, workers buy goods.  You want an efficient village where everyone has work, their needs met, and a place close to work they can call home.  Certain buildings have a customization system which allows you to assemble various building parts together to create custom layouts which increase their capacity or add extra functions to them.I think I'm reaching the point where I've got someone doing just about every job and I have a good equilibrium where my villagers are never starved for resources and my cash flow is always positive, which is about the point where I tend to put down a game like this, but I can see myself picking it back up again later to try out a new strategy or after an update is released, much as I previously did for Banished and I still do for Cities Skylines and other builder games I enjoy.	----->	10

104510819	This is a fantastic game and the implementation of Steam Workshop is the main selling point. After a little over a month after release, there are multiple hours of great rooms made by the community that are on par or better than the levels made by the developers. If you are on the fence, then give it a month or two for more community-made levels, because that is where a majority of the replay value is. If you like puzzles or escape rooms, then this is an absolute must-buy.Also, the system they have for designing the rooms for Steam Workshop is incredibly simplistic and easy for nearly anyone to use. The main difficulty comes from coming up with the puzzles to create.	----->	11

104570855	Amazing game! The concept has been around for a while, yet no other game gets across the excitement and rush of a real life escape room as well as this one. The rooms are challenging but not impossible, and there is a LOT of community content out there already. Hope the devs continue updating the game by adding rooms once in a while and fixing the small bugs that are present. Keep up the good work!	----->	4

104857542	It is an easy game to pick up and just casually play by yourself or with a group of friends. It was a smart idea to add a workshop for people to be able to create and design their own levels.

104947132	Its best escape room game out there. It doesnt have a dark atmosphere or fancy graphics like room, but it have something else. Its closest to the real life escape room experience. Simplistic graphics helps in to concentrate in the right things and the rooms have a great variety of different puzzles and artstyles. Top of that theres plenty of offical rooms and an editor + workshop support so you have much to play. Theres also hidden tokens in every room to find if you like that kind of thing. They are releasing more offical maps too in the future and the price is fair so I will definetly recommend this one if you like puzzles or escape rooms.	----->	19
104948118	Really enjoyed this playing with 3 of my friends. I'd say the standard rooms are best played with 3-4 people since they're usually small. There are community-made rooms that can hold a lot more people, but my group has yet to try them. Difficulty-wise, rooms aren't too easy to solve quickly and aren't too complex to leave everyone frustrated. Rooms provide enough challenge to stimulate my group's collective brains. Overall would definitely recommend.	----->	4

105013930	Very fun escape room simulator.I found the puzzles hit a good level, they often challenged me without ever being impossible or frustrating. The hint mechanic is also pretty good, though of course you should try to avoid using it! It starts by pointing you to the correct part of the room, before slowly hinting at the actual puzzle. While messing with it I did find it could trip up, and point you to some where where you have already collected the required item however.Not a ton of content official content right now admittedly, it depends how good you are I suppose, but there's 3 environments of 5 levels each (and a 4th environment with 2 of the 5 level released so far) with a 10 min achievement timer for each level. Course, you're unlikely to beat the timer for absolutely every level, so I'd estimate about 3 to 3 1/2 hours to complete them all. However, that's partially solved by having community made rooms! It has a pretty good room builder, so the workshop is filling full of very good player made rooms if you're wanting yet more escaping.The multiplayer is a good addition to the game as well!Very much would recommend to any puzzle fans.	----->	22
105015861	Even playing alone I really enjoy the puzzle and hints. I can't wait to play it with friends, maybe this winter when the houses are all burried in snow.So, to make it short:+ Great idea beautiful implemented+ Level editor is great	----->	6
105019817	Really enjoy playing this game.  It's quite relaxing, and as long as ur making gold, you can keep building ur village.

105086005	So i just finished Escape simulator and recommend it for sure, the asking price is quite low for what it offers and how much fun it is.Now lets go into more details, the game gives you 4 settings(space, egypt, victorian room and an office) and each settings has a few rooms that you have to solve. In the majority of the rooms the puzzles are easy to figure out but there are some that are quite hard on the later lvls. The main difficulty comes from finding everything you need to solve the puzzles. Early on every time i was stuck on a puzzle it was because i was lacking information. So dont go in here expecting baba is you lvl of difficulty on puzzles but expect a little more than the room games or the nonary series. Also i have to give props to the devs because in the majority of escape room games up until now you couldnt interact with everything but here you can, giving you much more freedom to lose your self in it.A few negative things i have to say about the game are these. The timer imo is useless and kinda ruins it for me, i get that real escape rooms have one but i dont see the point in this especially if you can go back into the room and solve it within the time limit to get the achievment. I wish there was a different system in place but this is not a big deal. My main issues are these, first the hint system is completly useless imo, for example i was stuck on an office lvl since i havent noticed a detail in one of the items, i use the first hint and i get something that i already did, ok i wait for the timer then get the second hint, which is basicly a number that you get from doing the thing they suggested in the first hint. At that point i just said fuck it happene to notice the item. I just wish that hints were a bit cryptic in a different format but that is hard to do, for example i had missed a tree, instead of giving tips on things i already did tell me that i missed something if you saw that i havent interacted with that item at all.One last thing i have to say about this game is that it has a lvl editor and workshop integration so you can expect to get some cool community lvls in the future.	----->	-9

I haven't delved into the user-made rooms, but I'm sure there is some great content there (they hosted a contest with a cash prize to generate interest). With the ability to play with friends, this game has the potential for some fun times and a good value for your dollar.	----->	16

105279423	i honestly can't recommend SpyParty in it's current state.1. It's been in Early Access for a long while. Now, that's not necessarily bad at all. It's to get as much player feedback, and heck, even the devs know it's been a long time in Early Access.2. It's a bit too pricey. It's a game that I never see on sale, and in my country, it's about 10 dollars, but I guess that varies from country to country.Heck, I love SpyParty. It has a certain charm to it, and the graphics are nice and simplistic, allowing it to run on toaster computers, like mine!I'd love to see more content come soon, as right now, it isn't great.	----->	14

105418364	Ran out of things to do after 18 hours. The 'tech tree' isnt very deep, and nor is the gameplay once you figure out the mechanics. Progression feels purposefully slow. That being said, its still a very relaxing, fun game. I wish there were more consequences, or armies that raid, or something. They definitely need more maps, more variety, and possibly other factions youre competing against.	----->	5

105474844	Fun little puzzle game. Like most puzzle games you'll want more when it's over, but what's here so far is good and there are community levels if you are into that sort of thing. If you like escape rooms or games like 'The Room' this is well made and worth your time.	----->	9

105521613	I love escape room games and this is quite well done, the rooms designed by the devs were great. The best part is when you've finished the official content, there's a lot of community content you can go through, and they're great too. Got  a lot of bang for the buck for this!	----->	8

105558284	As someone who works in an Escape Room, this game manages to capture the difficulty and charm of everything a real life room has! The puzzles are great, some easy some pretty difficult, and the rooms are SO well decorated! The little tokens to find in each room can sometimes be harder to find than solving the room itself too! Definitely a game to pick up if you have any interest in escape rooms at all, it's been a blast!	----->	6

105593885	Seems neat so far. Definitely requires thinking, but puzzles seem fair and manageable without hints. It's sort of like playing The Room but multiplayer and with a time limit.After finishing the tutorial and Egypt level, I'm really enjoying the experience. It took approximately an hour to get through 5 levels, without all of the extra tokens (about half on each level). That said, I would anticipate completing the core game to take between 4-6 hours (done solo).Glancing at the Steam Community, there's close to 900 levels listed there. I can't speak for the quality of those yet, but the value in this game seems to be the editor and the community. Once you've completed a level, aside from getting all 8 tokens, there's little reason to repeat (since you already know the solution).If you love puzzle games, and like the idea of community made content, it's well worth the price. If you only intend to play the core game, you might not feel the same way. For $12-15, I'm happy with the purchase.	----->	16

105600703	The game has some performance issues here and there related to frame rate drops but besides that, this game is a fantastic escape room simulator with a bunch of fun community-made maps. The puzzles in the base game are quite easy but the workshop feature and community rooms are what make this game great. I definitely recommend this game for what it's worth. (I've put 20 hours in and paid $15. That's absolutely worth it in my opinion)	----->	12

105602797	This game is very fun, so I'll recommend it, but for all the people saying it is extremely well polished, we found a bunch of controller bugs just in the first pyramid area. Specifically, the biggest one was any time we tried to use the brush, it locked you in place and we couldn't move anymore. The keyboard movement still worked, but we were trying to play with a controller from the couch. Controller is a bit janky all around with this game, but otherwise it plays great and the puzzles are fun.	----->	5

105608387	I should open that I absolutely LOVE escape rooms. Both real and virtual. I have quite a few in my steam library and was surprised that this one flew under my radar but boy am I glad that I found it. There is quite a good amount of content right from the start and they have already had a full campaign update for free. In addition there is a wealth of community made rooms already and having played two of those so far I can see where this is clearly made with an eye on the future and I cannot wait to see what new things are around the corner. I bought this on sale but I would have gladly paid the full price for it.	----->	9
105608446	Friends can't do grade 1 math. I love this game! :)In all honesty, there are not enough levels right now but I'm sure the devs will add more in the future. In addition to future updates there are also workshop maps so it's unlimited content for you and your friends!	----->	3

105613712	My wife loved Portal 2 and we've longed for a good Co-op puzzle game...It Take's Two was a bit more skill oriented with a controller than she liked vs being more puzzle focused. This game though - amazing for Wife (non-gamer) puzzle game if you've already done something like Portal 2. I wish there were more games like this / Portal 2 for coop puzzle multiplayer games. Well worth the money, great time with the spouse.	----->	22

105616304	Omg! This is so much fun. I just bought this based off its overwhelming positive reviews and some of the reviews I read. The game has a very smooth polished feel. You can easily go through the tutorial in about 20 minutes and learn how to pick up, examine and use objects. The winning piece of this game is its ability to play in co-op mode, ability to customize your character, and also the number of maps promised. Not only are the developers adding maps, but apparently, you can also create custom rooms and also play rooms others have created. The developers basically created a platform for Escape Rooms to be shared. I am very excited about this!	----->	13
105617335	Creative, relaxing and so, so beautiful.	----->	0
105617675	The base game has a decent amount of content. Plenty to justify the purchase.Community maps are easy to try, and most have been pretty fun. albeit a bit laggy.Hope they continue to support this game. It has solid QoL features. Some of the puzzles are a lot more interesting than real escape rooms, which often revolve far too much around number combinations.	----->	7
105617735	This turned out to be so much fun. I was worried at first that the puzzles might get repetitive, but there's a really nice variety. The different styles of rooms also keep it from getting stale. I haven't had a chance to try co-op yet, so I can't say much there, but single player has been a blast. I've just started digging into some of the community-made maps and they seem very well made. This game is definitely a great value and well worth it.	----->	7
105620132	Amazing game, great community and workshop rooms, the studio is very good for listening for bugs and questions and have made great additions since the games original release! There is always new rooms being added, from devs and players	----->	9

105626545	Escape Room - Expensive.  Probably not cleaned.  They require pants.  If you are slow like me they kick you out after an hour.Escape Simulator - Cheap.  My desk, somewhat clean.  Pants are optional.  The game does not judge if I drool on my shirt as the bonus clock ticks down to zero.Buy it for the single player experience.  Come back for the inevitable crazy creative workshop rooms and fixed multiplayer.  Take off your pants.  Escape in your underwear.  Be free.	----->	2

105685317	less than a quarter the price of an in person escape room at the mall but you get more than 20 rooms. Gameplay and music is relaxing but racing to get the trophy motivates you to hurry. Playing solo works fine but coop is better. The rooms when replayed are exactly the same but it's fun watching others try it for the first time and you still have to look for hidden tokens.	----->	5

The fact that it came out in October of 2021, and now (December 2021) has 900+ maps on the workshop speaks a lot about the ease to make maps for this game. It's great, and definitely worth the $15!	----->	6

105703091	Its so very cozy, if youre looking to relax with a easy to access city builder with some neat and somewhat unique features like zoning for residential, then this is the game for you.It is still very much WIP, but the developer is definetly doing a good and steady job.	----->	6

105722057	Very good escape game simulator, real fun with a friend. I wouldn't recommend doing the base game rooms with three persons, since the rooms are really small, but doing it in pair is nice.Some of the Steam Workshop rooms are really good (I recommend doing The miniature escape in duo, it was a really good experience).I encountered some minor bugs, namely: - controls remapping automatically; - player locked in an unstoppable move forward deplacement; - dropped item falling eternaly between ceil and floor.	----->	16

105737428	This game is great for fans of escape rooms. Really fun puzzles that are good for 2 or 3 people. Any more than that, there's not really enough puzzles for everyone to participate in at once (just like real escape rooms). All the main rooms are a blast. The difficulty isn't too high for people generally familiar with escape rooms and puzzles. Even though the main game is a little short (Finished in a little over 4 hours), there's tons of Workshop levels that seem to be great as well. The first two I did were pretty fun. And it looks like Pine Studio is continuing to release more rooms as well with the Omega rooms as the most recent addition.Highly recommended!	----->	15

105743384	incredibly fun game. I have honestly played much more of the user created content then the actual rooms provided, but the community creativity shows just how much potential this game has, especially if they can get more players purchasing this game.

105747189	Very good escape/puzzle game! Played solo and it's definitely very doable on your own (though it may take more than one try to finish some levels in less than 15 minutes if you're working on your own). The art style is pretty cute, and the customization options for your in-game avatar is a fun bonus. The only downside is that once you've solved a room, you can easily breeze through it a second time due to even the number/letter puzzles having a set solutions (would do well with setting at least those to be somewhat random), but allowing community created content definitely solves the matter of the game being fairly short, specially if you have a lot of experience with puzzle games.	----->	10

105751645	Well, First of all I must admit i was sceptical about the game at first, thought to my self hmm an Escape room in Games ? Seems too easy. Boy was i wrong, the Puzzles are quite fun and imaginative, the ability to move objects, inspect them, read books which hold clues to some puzzles and more. I've played this game with a friend since the start and the only thing i can complain about is the fact there is no shared inventory (we both just grab stuff and put it in our pockets, then think what on earth to do whilst the other is holding a hint object lol) Besides that There is nothing for me to complain would definitely recommend the game to people who enjoy solving puzzles and funny moments such as  (Oh shit moments where you realise the solution was way more simple then you realised) Me and my friend beat the Egyptian chapter in about 1 hour and 20 - 30 Minutes see if you can finish it sooner! Did i mention the game is ever expanding with the community making custom maps! so there is always something new to do!Good Luck Explorer !	----->	5
105752074	Very fun game! My mate and I enjoy a good challenge and this is the first puzzle game that is giving us a go to finish the rooms in the set time limit.There are some bugs, though. Some assets necessary for puzzles have glitched out and gone missing. If you find their bounding boxes you can pick it up; their inventory icons are then blank.	----->	10

105772412	It's really well made.This game is 100% perfect for escape room. It has everything you'll need and even a workshop, so people can make and upload there own levels.It has really good level, that makes you think. Some of them are really hard, which is great 10/10 game	----->	8

105775375	I used to play room escaping flash games on Minigames.com back in the days, this game brings back so many memories. I hope the developers can keep this pace of supporting the game so that its community will grow even stronger in the future. Other than that, for anyone wondering about the amount of workshop scenarios of Escape Simulator, at the current state, there are already 1000+ rooms available among the community. So, just enjoy~!	----->	4

105777217	Pretty fun virtual escape room experience. Difficulty ramps up at a respectable pace and its fun solo or co-op. The only problem is a lack of replay value, but thats intrinsic to escape rooms, and at least community rooms exist!	----->	2
105777948	Really fun and challenging game. Still it's a bit short, could have longer or more rooms, but the workshop it's filled with puzzles but most of them isn't very good. You can buy without fear, your purchase will be worth.	----->	4

105823753	We've only gone through one series of rooms so far, but it definitely gives you the IRL escape room feels.  Like in real rooms, you are on a timer, but you don't get kicked out when time runs out so you unlike real rooms, you can take your sweet time solving them... and you can trash the hell out of the room.In the series of rooms we did, we didn't encounter any asinine math puzzles or weird jumps in logic.  Everything followed some kind of reasonable logic and only on some occasions did we need to use external references; either we missed the clues or you're just expected to hit Google sometimes.  For example, one puzzle required us to decipher Braille, but we couldn't find any references to it within the game so we had to actually go look it up.  This is a no-no in real rooms, so while I allow that we totally missed something, there shouldn't be any reason to use resources outside of the room to solve a puzzle.  Some puzzles are pretty tough, but don't require you to somehow discover the theory of relativity while standing on your head trying to keep your pants down by your ankles.  True story, I swear.The game comes with (at the time of this writing) four series of themed rooms.  I can't say if they tell any kind of narrative, but the one we worked on didn't seem to have any.  Either way, a series is a handful of six or seven rooms (too lazy to check) that are filled with puzzles and hidden items to discover in order to work your way out the exit.  It works very well in co-op, but can be tackled in single player since the timer really has no bearing on whether or not you can get out.  The rooms are tiny, though, and lack some of the sense of adventure you might get in a real room.  However, getting to do more than one room in a series makes up for each room's relatively tiny size.On a technical level, the game is mostly solid with some squishy bits.  We encountered a pretty big bug that made a puzzle unsolvable, but it only affected one player.  The other players did not see the visual gaffe so they were able to solve it while the other player sat out.  Argument for co-op I guess.  Everything else works pretty well and the physics don't feel out of place even though they have little to no bearing on solving the puzzles.On the plus side, the game comes with a room editor and you have access to community-made rooms from the workshop, so if you really like escape rooms and can trust that the community doesn't stink (it doesn't), there's a lot of longevity baked into the engine which is very nice.  Some nice-to-haves would be larger room sizes and more character customization options, but none of those are dealbreakers.Overall, Escape Room Simulator does what it sets out to do and does it well.  With the community adding content via the workshop, there's plenty of fun to be had here, especially if you get together with some friends to tackle the rooms.  However, you can fly solo if you want to and still succeed, though perhaps getting through in time will be a challenge.  Fun, inexpensive, and well-made.	----->	9

105849260	Completed the game in one session with three other friends.We had a blast solving riddles and finding all of the hidden tokens.On a side note, this game runs really well, constant high FPS, smooth gameplay with only occasional stutterung (once per level or so). We had a few disconnects / crashes, but then those didn't bother us all that much in our 8h session. I'm pointing this out because AAA games can't reach this standard of good optimization on release - good job developers!Since the devs are working hard on adding new content and the game has workshop support I suspect we'll still be having fun playing it in the following months / years after release!	----->	10

105879667	Uhh, it's difficult to recommend this game; if I look at it only as a basic but super moddable puzzle game, and you happen to have someone to play often together, purchasing this it's a no brainer, even if it's a little on the expensive side, it has literally infinite maps thanks to the modding community, and the engine of the game is pretty good, so nothing more to say if that's your case; however, the game doesn't have a minimum of story that puzzle players may be used to have, as in a reason to solve the puzzles (Portal, Talos, The God Unit, The disappearence of Ethan Carther comes to mind), so if you are looking for even a tiny of story -a purpose- to solve the puzzles, only buy this game when it's on a good sale.	----->	11
105879673	Definitely worth the price!	----->	2
105882867	This game is really fun but you will struggle if your IQ is below 3 digit but it was a little too easy :> Buy it and play with friends Had a good time	----->	6

105885466	This game is a hit with anyone I've showed it to. Whether its a new gamer or a veteran, this is an enjoyable experience with a lot of custom maps. I particularly like the shooting style of this game, compared to a set strength graph every time. I think shooting with the mouse stroke makes the game a lot harder to master, but fun during the process. I've already got a handful of friends to try this game and they all loved it - so if you're on the fence, give it a try!	----->	11

105890401	So I'm a huge fan of escape rooms, movies, anything and everything like it. I have played this with a friend but oddly enough have played about 90% of it on my own and find it very entertaining. I think it can be played solo or with friends and still be equally enjoyable. I have beaten all the levels that are currently available (not fan made levels) and really would love to play some more that will hopefully be released later on. I don't think this game is either easy or difficult because it really depends on the type of thinker you are and if you have experience with escape rooms and/or puzzle games in general. Overall I love it and really hope more levels come out soon!	----->	15

105899831	This game was really good which was  getting difficult to the end. Getting this game to 100% without any walkthrough was really tough but it feels really accomplishing to finnaly do it. I recommend playing it with one friend cauze alone it gets quite monotonous  but with a friend u can have a lot of fun. With 2 or more friends it could get messy cauze the rooms can get super small and u are only getting in the way of each other	----->	5
105901078	Done about 65 real life escape rooms. Usually cost about $30 each. This game scratches the itch without having to pay for each one. The game's escape rooms are really good, but Kudos to the great community that keeps putting out free content. Some are unbelievably well thought out. If it was just the base game, it would be worth $20, but with the community adding more every day, it's easily worth double.	----->	5

105980983	I haven't played through this game much, but it has great little puzzles, cute graphics, and is really a game you'd wind down with. I've only ever played solo missions and I'd love to put 2 brains together to really test our wits while also proving who has a higher gear in cognitive function.Escape Simulator has a fair price tag for the content it brings. Theoretically, the content is endless with the community level editor and publisher, which must I add is probably the smartest move any game developer could make, as well as a team who will release more official levels in the future.	----->	12
105983382	very good fun game. puzzles are a decent challenge but have consistent mechanics that make the very solvable but still has a lot of challenge and nuance from room to room. definitely worth the buy and i'm really looking forward to diving into the room creator and community rooms	----->	7

106012102	Escape Simulator is self-explanatory in the name itself, your goal is to escape the room which contains puzzles.After playing couple of rooms with my girlfriend we found this game to be extremely fun and engaging as it requires both of players to communicate in order to solve a specific puzzle in that room. You have to inspect every room extremely carefully as there is some hidden items to solve a puzzle, but also there is some hidden optional cards known as tokens which can be hidden in really hard to see places but provides really fun experience (There is only 8 tokens per room).I still haven't tried playing single-player but the game itself provides their players with a option to create their own rooms and puzzles and upload them in workshop so other players can access them and try solving those puzzles which is extremely fun and unique way of adding more rooms for users to enjoy! The community is extremely helpful and fun to talk with, you can even make some friends there and find a buddy to play co-op!Would highly recommend this game to anybody who want to play it single player or even co-op as it provides really fun experience and makes you use your brain!	----->	28
106013506	A fun game to play with a friend. The rooms are sometimes a bit small and with two it can feel crowded. However some of the puzzles really benefit from multiple minds! Please add more options for clothes :)	----->	6

106017754	very fun game	----->	4
106019060	The puzzles are clever enough to hurt your feelings sometimes but most people should be able to get through them. This game is great solo but extra good in co-op. Totally recommend.	----->	6
106019860	dude, this game isn't even fun anymore.	----->	4
106020993	My head hurts more from looking for tokens than solving the puzzles. So much pain. Take breaks if you play this game.Already it's quite good especially for the low price and allowance for community maps right away. The puzzles go both ways where there are a few small ones you solve whenever or its one big puzzle that goes a step at a time. There is oddly enough a fair amount to look at in such small rooms that I'd highly suggest playing co-op as it's much more enjoyable (if both people like puzzle games of course).8/10. One of the better escape room games made especially recently.	----->	9

106064910	Really enjoyed this game, when I was able to play it. Unfortunately every so often while playing on a server with my friends it would disconnect me, and I wasn't able to rejoin the ongoing game. The problem definitely wasn't my internet connection as I was connected on voice call the whole time.However I honestly had such a blast playing before disconnecting I would still heartily recommend it.	----->	0
106065244	I've played a little over an hour and a half of this game and I'm already loving it! If you love puzzle games you NEED to pick this up. I can't wait to go through the rest of the story levels and then play the user created content!!	----->	5

106076622	I love real life escape room and this a great video game verison. I think this very well done and very fun to play with friends. I think the rooms can be challenging but nothing impossible. My only complaint is that the hint system does always line up to where you are stuck in the room. Other than that 10/10 would recommend this game and I hope they expand and add more rooms!	----->	12

106142897	This is online co-op done right. You know how with some games, it's a massive pain in the ass to get into an online session with friends? You've got to get into exactly the right menu, then figure out exactly the right settings, then get your friends into a different menu, figure out exactly the right settings to get them into your session, then pray to miscellaneous gods that you don't get disconnected or you've got to do it all over? Escape Simulator isn't like that. Literally takes less than 10 seconds from launch to get everyone into the same session and pop into a level together. If every game had online co-op that easy to get into, there'd be a lot less dust collecting on my Steam library.	----->	-2
106143022	Have played several real life escape rooms and I already enjoy this experience even more.  The game makers definitely captured the essence of an escape room and turned it up a notch in ways that only a video game can. For the price, this game is a great deal!  An average escape room experience lasts an hour, at most, and you will pay at least 30 bucks per trip.  I do hope they do VR and I'll buy it again.	----->	3
106144693	A fun game to play not too hard. the only negative i would say is that their is no real threat to your village w/out mods and their is only one mod that adds a threat to your village.	----->	-3

106159964	Quite nice economy and town / kingdom building game. I really like the atmosphere and the fact that you have the opportunity for war, but it is not the main focus of the game.

106218112	I have found golf it as one of my most favourite games because of the experiences I've had playing it. Me and my friend often play this together and its always fun because there is a wide variety of maps you can download from trolls to luck or even pure skill its all there. Another reason though why I enjoy this is its easy to figure out they didn't make the editor to hard to understand in case you wanna make a map and overall is a nice layout for trying to find what you want. Great quality and very pretty only thing is some maps can tend to lag if to much has been added in.	----->	12

106308595	This game quickly sucked me in- though not because of the gameplay- because of the in depth workshop room editor! It's truly a brilliant unity-like game design portal. It's JUST complex enough for me to know there are things I could do if I was smarter, and just open enough to allow me to strive to design the things I want to try. Best game I've played in a while!	----->	6

106325337	[h1] Escape Simulator [/h1]Escape Simulator is an escape room simulator in which you and an optional small group of friends can attempt to solve puzzles in order to escape a room. The game features several themed areas with 5 rooms a piece in that same theme. Each room will have several puzzles to solve, typically in a linear pattern, before you can escape said room. Graphically, the game looks great for what it is, and the music and sounds are very satisfying. The rooms and the puzzles themselves are challenging and will hit a niche for anyone who adores these types of mental work outs.With workshop support and several hidden tokens to find, replayability is not at all an issue. I myself played with a friend sitting next to me as we worked to solve these rooms by ourselves, and we had an absolute ball. When she wasn't yelling at me to not brute force my way through a puzzle, of course! My only real complaint are the controls. Using a mice and keyboard, I found it rather awkward to grab an item and shuffle it into my inventory, as well as handling items as a whole, which you will be doing a lot of. Combining items especially is something I think could use a little more polishing, but the game is playable regardless of the awkward feeling.If you love puzzles and find the idea of an escape room appealing while your friends yell at you to turn around and check that wall one more time, than you will love Escape Simulator. Give it a go!	----->	8
106325598	:)	----->	0
106326788	Really good fun! Not that many rooms within the game itself (although the newest update added more!), but since players can create rooms and share them via the workshop there's so much extra content available, that I think it's definitely worth it!	----->	6

106338101	8/10Escape room the video game.It has a pretty large number of official rooms to go through and even Steam Workshop support for when you do them all.   I am quite dumb so it takes me quite a while to solve puzzles but they are all quite clever and the rooms are themed quite well.  It is fun by yourself or with friends if you want to just have that authentic escape room experience without having to actually go to one yourself.  It is important to note that this game does require quite a lot of thought to clear some of the levels.	----->	10
106339382	Kept my wife and I entertained for a week or more playing almost everyday before we just finished it. Has at least 30 levels that are all very unique in their design plus there are many community levels but had trouble downloading them so we gave up on that plus I'd rather leave it for now. Very fun and engaging game that got frustrating at times.	----->	-1

106341491	Purchased during sale, I've just spent the entire night doing puzzles with a friend and my brain is fried. This game is worth the price, but I would only recommend it IF you have someone to play it with. If you can play this game alone and have fun, you are a psychopath.	----->	2

106369819	Played though all the single player and a few community games.  While the game is a bit simplistic the puzzles are FANTASTIC.  Every clue has a flow to another clue, and it all feels natural.  It doesn’t feel like you must make insane jumps of logic to the next part of the puzzles.  You can finish this without having to use any help if you keep a look out for the clues and pay attention.The community editor is nice too with a bunch of assets.  To be honest, I hope for more DLC content, I love the writers.	----->	9

106390967	An absolutely brilliant game. Got this for my wife because she loves escape rooms, and we don't really play the same types of games. Watched her play on her own, and within an hour I was buying another copy for myself. We spent an entire afternoon sharing laughs, high fives, and victories. She loves the community rooms, and the amount of polish and thought in these puzzles is absolutely suberb.

106458801	If you're a fan of escape rooms, then this game is for you! The puzzles are so clever, and I had so much playing with my friend. I played with one other person, and I think that was the perfect amount of pacing for us. We completed most of the puzzles under the allotted time, but there were some we didn't finish on time. Great game!!	----->	5
106462836	Most fun I had playing a game in a while. Co-op works great, rooms that developers made are just amazing. I really hope this game will grow even bigger as more people play it.

106471863	This game is a banger, it's exactly what you would want from an escape room game, if not more than that.The recent Christmas update shows that the devs are still adding to the game, and the workshop compatability is proof that the devs dont want to force you to pay for every little additional piece of content. this game is made with love and it shows.	----->	3
106474897	This is the best, way to enjoy the sweet enjoyment of wanting to kill yourself. while playing with friend's you may want to say they aren't you're friends anymore. and want to kill them I Defintlely recommend this.	----->	2

106481587	Very good escape room simulatorThe gameplay was smooth, with no bugs or glitches affecting our playthrough. The puzzles were difficult enough to be challenging (might have needed some hints oop). Everything about the game is pretty intuitive with everything being easy to control and thus progress through the game. The only downside is that there weren't as many rooms as we'd like, meaning that total gametime was less than 8 hours. Whilst there are custom workshop maps, they were sorta buggy and not very interesting with the lack of the complexity that the campaign rooms consist of.Hopefully they continue to add more rooms as we would be excited to come back and continue to play!	----->	5
106482767	Alongside the 15 levels included with Escape Simulator is a custom room editor, allowing players to create their own puzzles and upload them to Steam Workshop. The system is quite in-depth and makes use of logic-chains in a simple-to-understand way. Adjusting and placement of items can be cumbersome, but with a little practice and patience, the systems are easy enough to understand. Downloading custom maps is simple with the Steam Workshop and will add longevity to the game itself.Overall, Escape Simulator is a great way to experience an escape room without leaving the house. The smooth gameplay and realistically solvable puzzles make for an enjoyable experience. Player-created rooms will undoubtedly only add to the value and make Escape Simulator an easy purchase for puzzle fans.	----->	4

106553659	This was a really enjoyable game to play with my friend, I could see this being a game that has content packs for years to come, maybe $3-4 for a set of 4 themed levels with a sort of underlying story similar to the manor levels. Basically what I'm saying is I'm excited to play more official levels and try more community maps too. Multiplayer puzzle games are some of the most fun I've ever had.	----->	7

106554124	So if you like Golf With Your Friends and you dont have a VR, do not play this game. The angle you have to use to play is terrible, you dont control a power level, you pull back a putter like a ps2 pool game. But if you have VR or like ps2 pool, you'll love it. My friends were evenly split on feelings. If they can make a normal version like GWF where you get power level and such, probably could be a decent game.	----->	11

106587910	I really do like this game.  The timer makes the puzzles seem so much harder than they really are.  Also, I had a support issue very early on.  For some reason my PS5 controller worked one day and then wouldn't work in the game at all the next day.  Support messaged me back right away and my issue was fixed.  Great team.	----->	4

106615410	Amazing game. Hard-core players can find the rooms exciting and enjoyable, while younger and less experienced players can use the clue button, which prints out clues to help solve the puzzles.Furthermore each room takes around 20-30 minutes on first attempt, which is a reasonable length to play a room for!Overall amazing and would highly recommend for playing solo, as well as with a couple of mates	----->	12

106625447	I got Escape Simulator for me and another to play together and we went hard into completing every room within the first 24 hours of having it. I've found we both have certain strengths when it comes to certain puzzles which definitely helps when one of us is stumped on something. Super fun and I wish there was more content! The rooms other players have made have also been fun but we've found a lot of rooms lack any direction when going into them and some are just ridiculously impossible to figure out without looking at comments or tips.	----->	10

106669160	Простой по процессу, но в какой-то мере забавный (и местами залипательный на загадки) симулятор квеструма. Хотя иногда может накрывать клаустрофобия, ибо комнатки там тесноватые, особенно если играешь не один.	----->	0
106669863	Would both reccomend and not recommend at the same time. takes about 6 hours to finish all of the base game puzzles. Theres no variation and all the puzzles are always the same when replaying. The only thing that redeems it is that you can download more community puzzles from the workshop. Puzzles are solid and gets your noggin going. Another thing is that its always one single room, and its the size of a fridge. So if you play with 2-3 friends the whole room will be cluttered with things pretty much instantly.	----->	4

106690145	A cozy game to play with friends.+Creative puzzles with cool themes+Can be played co-op+Overall a sweet game+Workshop is supported and is encouraged by devs-Would love to see more official rooms, currently, the game itself is rather short	----->	10
106690206	Long we have waited for a good implemented escape room simulator. Out there are a couple which get close but this game is totally lives up to it.The rooms people put out are just amazing and some go further than the developer made levels. The creativity of the community is outstanding. Giving the possibility for community and developer rooms make the game great. Keep doing the good work Pine and looking forward what this game will bring! :)	----->	9
106690259	So this game is basically an online version of escape rooms. We have a couple of those types of attractions where I live but due to COVID and my only friends being online I haven't experienced one of those IRL (mainly the latter reason).I like this, although I would like more levels from the developers and varying levels as well...there's also no indicator of how easy/hard a level is.	----->	4
106697176	Pretty fun game, especially if you have friends. Levels are unique and interactive. Only had one problem with one of the levels as it couldn't let us pass through since we fumbled with the interactions too much. Other than that, good game to pick up and play with a friend or two.	----->	5

106719134	TL:DR - Game is worth the asking price despite a major flaw.Just to be upfront about a HUGE problem with this game, the solutions are hard coded. So if you solve a lock and the answer is 1220, it will always be 1220. With some of these, you can solve the room in a few seconds. This limits the replay-ability of the game.However, there is a redeeming factor. There are a LOT of community made maps. So far, none of them are as good as the native game levels, but it does add hours of playtime to the game.	----->	4

What's most amazing is that you can build and design some buildings however you want, and there are lots of mods that make the game incredible. Absolutely my favorite game, it's a mix of Banished and Settlers though Much Better. If you like city building games, this game is for you. Buy it.	----->	12

106755660	This game is fantastic. Absolute must play for fans of escape rooms and puzzle games alike.The inclusion of community catered rooms is awesome and I cant wait to torture friends with this feature.If this game ever adds VR support, it would be the cherry on top of the cake.ONE negative/concern I have is regarding the replay-ability for the base-game levels. The solutions to the rooms is the same everytime. For some puzzles this is unavoidable given the clues are based on baked in visual elements. However for some puzzles that involve text based clues/numerical codes, I feel like these could easily be randomly generated per session.TL;DR: Great game. Dont watch streamers play it, go in blind, you will have a blast.	----->	4

106768507	Escape Simulator is a really good game.I like how everything works and all the types of rooms. I also like that there are community rooms, which makes it almost impossible to have nothing to play with.All from easy to hard rooms, big maps to smaller maps, some with a short story or mysterium, and those when you maybe got kidnapped. There is always something for everyone in this game.The only thing I don't like is the menu and how the characters and some object looks. just a little too soft cartoon look, which I personally don't like, but who cares when everything else is amazing.Definitely recommend it,9,5 Out of 10!!	----->	14

There are community-based levels that we have yet to explore.Some of the puzzles are super hard and this definitely isn't a walk in the park to solve a room. I also never felt that some of the clues or rooms were totally unfair in terms of their design.Overall a fun game if you want to have fun with friends.	----->	17

106941308	Nice game to play with friends, or alone. Vanilla rooms are played through in one or two long sessions, so either hop on some community rooms or wait for more updates ig - that being said the vanilla rooms are pretty entertaining.	----->	1

106943593	Hectic in coop. If you play with more than 2 people idk how you're going to get anything accomplished other than find the tokens faster.Holiday Update screwed up an achievement so now I'm waiting for a bug fix so I can 100% this game. Pretty fun if you like playing escape rooms or puzzle games. Can't wait for what updates they have in the future. If they take a book out of Human Fall Flat or any other similar doughy looking game with community implementation, the community will add content for the future.	----->	5

106949362	It's pretty fun! The community made level have a severe lack in quality compared to the levels made by the devs. This isn't always the case in games with community components. I'd recommend getting this game if you plan on doing it with friends in person, racing, or something like that. If not, I'd recommend waiting.	----->	3

106950854	It's a fun game that brings the mystery and puzzles of escape rooms into the virtual format. Some levels are more challenging than others, but overall it is a really enjoyable time, especially with friends/family. Look forward to more levels being released for more re-playability. It is great that there is the option to create your own Escape Room and also play other's creations which helps to make it more playable.	----->	8

106957297	I have been waiting for a solid co-op game with minimal resources that's more about teamwork than competition to play with my wife. Waiting for over 5 years. We met playing league of leagends and married 6 years ago, and I quit and we haven't found the game until now. I am happier than I have been in years. We played through the tut, all of egypt, and one of the space ones. It was such a fantastic time working together to beat the puzzles. I know it's corny or whatever, but I am so happy tonight because of this game. Our marriage was fine, but this gave me back the extreme happiness I was looking for while doing something together that is so simple and easy to put on. Thank you all for making things for this game, and thank you dev for putting it out there. This is epic, and I enjoyed every minute so much. Best less than $30 for 2 copies I've ever bought. Please advertise and sell a couples copy. Thank you again.	----->	15
106957610	Escape Simulator is so fun! I really enjoyed playing it with my friends. In my opinion, it's best played solo or with one other person. I played with 3 other people once and there's just too much chaos in one tiny room. The most recent update has an option to help with motion sickness but this game still makes me sick after playing a couple rooms which is a bummer... :(Great game! I'm sad my dumb body can't play more in one sitting but I did complete every level eventually.	----->	-4
106958314	Very fun, just if you dont plan on getting community rooms, don't get the game. It doesnt have a lot of original content on its own. I finished it in a few hours. Over all fun and challenging.	----->	4
106958388	This game is an absolute blast with friends and solo. Puzzles range from fairly simple to more complex ones. There's also a large community where people make their own escape rooms. Do yourself a favor and pick this game up. Hell, pick up a couple copies and give it to a friend or two and play together. You won't be dissapointed!	----->	1

106962024	God, this is a good game. Escape room games are one of my favorite genres as a late night party game with some friends. The demo of the game is enough to pull you in and want more as it gives a big enough insight into the game play to get you hooked. The physics and controls are phenomenal. Pine Studio put their heart and soul into mastering this puzzle game and throwing it above the others. The puzzles are quite difficult at times, but are all fantastic. The developers nailed it with the time limit setting. Fifteen minutes are given for most (if not all) of the puzzles, and this time goes quite fast. The good thing about this timer is that when it runs out nothing changes. This lack of punishment for taking it slow and easy is such a good touch. The game would be ruined if it had ended when time ran out. I played this game with one friend and that was enough to solve each puzzle quickly. There are so many puzzles that this game is really the best option when looking for an escape room simulator. The workshop compatibility for the game makes it unending and enjoyable for many many hours. Perfect game. I look forward to updates and additional levels.TL;DR: This game is the perfect multiplayer escape room to have a few drinks while playing. The rooms are incredibly detailed and almost never glitch. (only glitches being visual stuff that goes away in a second, nothing that ruins game play) The servers are fantastic and work well with more than just 2 people. If you're looking for a cheap game to buy to test how dumb your friends are, this is the one. PS: No matter how dumb you think your friends are, you will say or do something even dumber at some point during this game. Just don't yell at each other too much. :/	----->	11

106990822	I almost refunded this game at first. Was kind of frustrating trying to get things started with villagers and the painting of areas to make them settle and build houses. BUT, I kept it and very happy I did. Once you get the game mechanics figured out, it is a great game. Just add a few mods and it becomes even more fun. There are a few really good maps out there, and also some really good mods for workplaces and for building really nice castles. I also like that on the Build toolbar, there is actually a button for items from mods that gives you a quick way to see what is from a mod and what is not. It would be nice if they would take the mod building items out of the regular build buttons and have sub-menus for them in the primary build button tho, but that would mean the modders would need to link them to a proper sub-category. It would also be nice if the mod map makers would put an actual proper definition and screenshot of the map so you can tell what is what with downloaded maps. That's not the companies' fault, but just lazy modders. One other note on mods, keep an eye on the posted and updated dates of them. Some mods are old and outdated, as with all mods for for any game.ANYWAY, get the game, learn it and I think you will love it too!	----->	25

107018557	Bought this on a whim based on Steam recommendations and reviews to play co-op with my 9y old son and it has been an absolute blast so far. The puzzles are challenging, yet not frustrating. They have you thinking outside the box and it seems my son and I were taking turns on figuring things out. So far a few rooms had us run out of time, yet the game simply lets you continue on still. It doesn't punish you by kicking you out or making you start over, nor does it emphasize the timer failure, which is great when playing with younger ones.The secret objects then just add that little extra for the more veteran gamers, or to add an extra challenge to the timer if you want it. We usually ended up searching for them after we completed a room.Overall a great experience so far. A highly recommend from me for my fellow gaming parents.	----->	6

107070918	If you like puzzles, and always wanted to do an Escape Room, this is a good start. Don't worry about the timers, that's just for the trophy for the room; there's no time limit to complete the room. :) Always look at the puzzles from different angles if need be, as sometimes the answer is right in front of you and you just haven't seen it. It gives a rather satisfying feeling of accomplishment when you solve those puzzles.	----->	3

107128608	Aside from one nasty bug in a specific room, this offers a fun time especially if you can gather up your friends. I also like how the puzzles aren't too cryptic and mostly visuals based. Although at the end it felt a bit shorter than I expected, it felt a lot longer while I was playing. At least it comes with Workshop support so there can possibly be an endless amount of levels given the game won't lose steam in the future. Also the devs seem to update the game from time to time; it might not be a loose estimate to expect new levels and rooms in the future from them. Since I don't have any single player experience I can't vouch for any good time on that front and on the contrary I actually think it can be a bit frustrating considering some of the puzzle mechanics present throughout the rooms. However, I do recommend it. And like how it states in the description, it's best to play with 2 to 3 friends or more, take that into consideration before your purchase.	----->	10

107143023	It took me a while to figure this game out. So many restarts, so much looking online for an answer to a 'simple' question. There are so many rabbit trail layers to building and development that it's almost frustrating. However, now that I've spent 21 hours playing this game, I can honestly say that it's been one of the more enjoyable city building games that I've played.	----->	0
107143487	I returned to this game after about 2 years of not touching it. I remember the game as rough, but promising. Since then there seem to have been significant improvements to the rougher areas of the game, and it is more enjoyable and polished now. There is still some way to go until this early access title is ready for full release, but things are shaping up. I'm pleased to see all the issues they already have addressed, and I'm excited to see where the  game is going.  The organic building is refreshing change from the über-organized squares you all too often see in other games, and the monument system allows you to personalize your castles, inns, or churches. I'd say it's good value for the current discounted price, and maybe even the full price if this is the kind of itch you need to scratch.My current concern for the game is the staying power as it seems to become less interresting around ~300 villagers worth. There's just less to strive for besides growth for the sake of growth.	----->	13

107166042	Was very fun and lasted about 9 hours of playtime with the included levels when played with a second person. There was a good amount of puzzle variety. Only minor bugs including each person seeing an object turned a different way and one person not being able to interact with a puzzle. Somewhat motion-sickness inducing, especially the community levels.	----->	7

107187603	Does exactly what the title says! The rooms are very cleverly designed and the workshop offers literally endless amounts of rooms for you to play solo or coop.Solo can be a bit tricky to complete in the time frame but playing with friends is a blast!	----->	0
107187688	It's been a long time since I've had this much fun in a game. It's engaging and extraordinary well made. 10/10 and I'm so excited for when more rooms get added.	----->	7
107195368	There are many escape games out there that have only like 1 to 5 rooms that are poorly made and at high price. This is leagues better and includes a level editor, steam workshop, and multiplayer. What more could you ask for?	----->	3
107195505	I love this game to death! Watching Vanoss and his friends play this game with the support of the workshop brings tons of laughs. Now playing the game with friends having ball collisions on hitting them and screwing them over brings tons of laughs.	----->	3

107197525	Reminds me of real life escape rooms but with more creative and out of boundaries ways. (Also cheaper and they don't kick you out because you passed 60 minutes)Comparing to 'we were here' series, this game is easier. This requires dot connecting skill but less brain power.(We had to look up walkthrough for 'we were here'. I'm not smart!) Best thing about this is that you can also play community levels so it's definitely worth the money.	----->	3

107198926	I've been playing this game for a while now and it's been so addicting. I love that the achievemenst also drive good goals for this game too. What Iove most is that mod support allows for endless customization.I really love the vibe of this game too. I've played a lot of aoe and I always loved the civilization building aspect, and I wanted something that focuses more on that and economy, and foundation is exactly that, If that's the kind of game that sounds interesting to you, i'd strongly recommend this game!	----->	20

107233866	I have not tried to create my own escape rooms. I will only rate the inlcuded levels.The Escape simulator lets you play escape rooms in 3D. There are multiple themes, each of them includes multiple rooms.The rooms are quite small but got multiple puzzles in them Each room takes about 10-15 minutes to solve. This small design is working very well. The design of those rooms follow the theme and look pretty good. The puzzles got a nice difficulty and are logical. Only one small puzzle so far was a little strange.Additionally all the puzzles allow experimenting and testing without any deadlocks.Overall the experience was very enjoyable and the puzzles were very nice to play through.A lot of players complain about network issues. I have played 4 hours in coop and did not have a single disconnect/ lag or any other kind of issue.Additionally, thanks to all the small rooms, it is very easy to restart a room and just redo the puzzles you had solved already, as this takes only a couple of seconds. So even if there is a network issue once in a while, it should not ruin the fun too much. People complaining about dropping out of the session and watching their friends solving all puzzles, must have stupid friends. Of course when playing in coop you should not pick up items, but store them at a certain position in the room, so everyone can access them.I think you get the most out of the game if you play with two players, otherwise you will miss a lot of content.	----->	9
107237422	Fun playing with friends, Game is worth every cent.	----->	2

107256182	Since the pandemicm, have gotten really into digital escape rooms as a thing to do even with my non-gamer friends. Have tried a bunch of them, this one  is the nicest by far, as it's 1-time payment and community built rooms means tons of content!	----->	-1
107261247	Blown away at this game. Really fun simulation of real escape room. Can't believe it's the first time I've seen one on steam like this, but it's very polished with community maps that add to replay ability.	----->	5
107262399	very good game and very fun time with friends	----->	7
107262653	Se você quiser torrar uns neuronios esse jogo pode lhe servir muito bem kkkk.O jogo é mais legal se você jogar com alguém, mas é divertido se vc quiser jogar sozinho também. A única coisa ruim é que ele é totalmente em inglês, então os enigmas também são, elemento que acaba dificultando um pouco no entendimento dos puzzles se você não souber muito bem inglês.	----->	0

107270031	Very cool! It is a simple game but very addicting and I am glad there is a workshop as well. It gives this game endless content and the rooms it comes with are very cool too. Just wish I had friends to play it with :)	----->	5
107271384	If you're looking for a challenge or a puzzle game that makes you think a bit this game is for you. This game is full of a bunch of escape rooms that each have their own unique challenges. Just to put the icing on the cake there are also really fun community made maps that you can download from the workshop.	----->	2

107298638	Really fun game, especially in co-op. The included levels have some excellent puzzle design which really makes you think and is very satisfying to figure out. Very excited to check out custom levels as the game appears to feature a very detailed level editor which should add tons of extra content. Well worth it :)I also read the devs are planning to add VR which would be very nice for this kinda game, moving around and investigating items feels like it would be perfect in vr :)	----->	20
107299941	Very cool medieval city builder/management game. Planning out your town and seeing it grow in an efficient manner feels uniquely satisfying. This game has lots of potential to become even better and bigger.I want more unique buildings. New resources, products and luxury goods. Even many different weapons (and armor and shields?) would be cool. And building upgrades, allowing more working villagers and/or increased generation per building.Also add like another 80 achievements to pursue, I love achievements. Having some performance issues when the town gets a bit bigger.	----->	10

107315521	This is probably one of the best escape games out there! The fact that it allows for community rooms (for no additional cost - at this point) is very exciting and gives the game a whole different level. It is a very fun game to play solo OR with a friend (or two). I really love seeing how the community comes up with creative rooms and puzzles too! I cannot wait to see what other rooms the developers come out with! A few points I wish were addressed:• Ability to restart a game without having to leave (this is annoying when you are playing co-op because you have to recreate the room)• Colorblind setting (especially for games that use colors)	----->	11
107319198	Very fun to escape the rooms but they are a bit harder than i expected it to be	----->	3
107321745	Great game with friends!	----->	0
107321821	Some of this game's mechanics are really weird, like I need common clothes to upgrade villagers to commoners but I need commoners to unlock the tailor's workshop in order to make clothes. It can't be traded either so I'm stuck. It's a relaxing game but lacks fluent progression. I hope it gets better in the future.	----->	6

107381390	I got this game a few days ago and played it for about 8 hrs almost straight.Dont expect a huge amount of content but rather a peaceful and soothing city builder. There is no story, campaign, multiplayer etc., you wont thrive to new centuries and unlocking futuristic buildings or technologies.BUT this game welcomes you with an open heart. Very intuitive, easy to learn and master game. Best compared to Anno, but way more simple. I love it for its casual gameplay.	----->	11

107391188	Get Me Out!!!!!!!!!! I got addicted. Btw the community levels are such a smart feature good job implementing that. game play is pretty simple and straight forward and and the levels difficulty are challenging and well balance in my opinion.------------In addition to all the good stuff i think it could get a bit more love in the costumes. overall there is not much to choose and lacks a little more personality. this applies to nerds like me who like to customize characters. the characters model it self are pretty good. -----------The game could also use a good color blind mode. there are times that certain objects just blend too well in the environment. i understand some of that is on purpose but for people with colorblindness that shit is completely invisible to the eye.	----->	16

107429053	I gave it a thumbs up, but with some remarks:Con:1) The game is a bit simplistic. I finished all achievements in one playthrough, although it took 51 hours...2) There is no campaign, which in my opinion it should have. And, yes, I know, it's a sandbox game.Pro:1) It allows you to design some of your own buildings.2) It has nice mods out there, which I'll try out soon.	----->	2

107437326	fun, with good puzzles!	----->	3
107441137	Maybe I should have read the description more clearly - this game has online, lobbied multiplayer, so you can play with strangers. I thought that I'd have to convince a friend to get this game too, so that was a very pleasant surprise.This game has a detailed but easy to follow tutorial.I'm still a total noob at this game, but I have to say, I find playing as the spy far more enjoyable than playing as the sniper. As the spy, I feel mischievous and it's more entertaining to me to outsmart the sniper. When playing as the sniper, you've got to use your knowledge of being a spy to find any way to catch them out, and perhaps that means the best snipers will always beat the best spies. Maybe the game is perfectly balanced, though. I'm still new. Playing as the sniper is a challenge, and it is rewarding when you see something and the penny drops.Yes...well done 🤝🏻	----->	17
107445906	I'm an escape room lover and have visited over 40 Escape Rooms in my city. This game is perfect! Riddles are logical and can be solved after few minutes of thinking. I love the fact that the game contains maps from the workshop, giving the player the opportunity to play on thousands of maps from other players while waiting for new  official ones. Graphics are amazing and suit the game perfectly. Also i read that some people recommend playing it with more ppl. That is not really needed in my opinion, cause if you really love riddles and escape rooms you will have fun solving them on your own. In conclusion, official maps are amazing, community maps give you  the opportunity to play on more levels and not just wait until developers add new maps, graphics suit the  game perfectly ,item interaction couldn't be better. As an escape room game its 10/10.	----->	22
107446832	I played this game co-op with my girlfriend and it was a blast. The puzzles are very creative and challenging. It was fun to figure out how to do each step and even resetting a couple times to get within the time limit. My favorite part about each stage is that every room has it's own separate theme so while they may have a much larger theme in common, each room feels unique and brand new. We will be revisiting this game to do some custom puzzles and I can't wait to see more stages and even costumes in the future. 10/10	----->	8
107448746	Super fun Escape the Room experience for anyone stuck at home and want to replicate the experience with friends!	----->	3

Looking forward to more dev published rooms in the future.	----->	4
107461833	I love escape rooms, I love the co-op version where I can play with the friend/s I often do escape rooms with. The game is good, had an issue at one point where i kept getting only a few frames but it sorted itself out and is running like it did/should. The rooms themselves are good and are detailed and the hidden tokens to collect is an addition which is good	----->	12

107474972	Its a fun game, BUT if you are an experienced player of city builder games, you will have no/low difficulties. After about 8h of playtime you can have built most of the buildings and then its a waiting game for new immigrants. I do recommend to buy it if you want a relaxing atmosphere and the dynamic development of the cities is a great take on the genre, but I hope that more complexicty will be introduced to the game.	----->	12
107475098	One of the worthiest games to play with friends.	----->	0
107478509	OK, I do really enjoy this game, Graphics are fun, puzzles are hard. Hints are plenty. However, the base game with no community content is small. It took me only 7 hours to complete. Now I normally go by the rule, £1 = 1 hour, so this game doesn't really cut it.	----->	0

It doesn't feel like there's any point having an army.3. Resources are virtually unlimited. There's hardly any management involved.4. Essentially there are only two types of quest.5.

107495176	Overall Summary:Great game that brings the essence of escape rooms to the keyboard. Worth the price with expandable content and multiplayer.Pros:+ Custom escape rooms made by players+ Texture variations and room specific props+ Challenging maps and great puzzles+ Good publisher tutorials+ Crisp cartoon textures+ Average sound/music+ Character customization (limited)Cons:- Some clipping issues when crouching (into props)- No importing custom assets (They have added custom prop importing now)- Wall pillars have back-facing issues.- No vertical movement (stairs, ramps, jumping)	----->	3

107519880	Good little game to play with a friend. Most of the clues aren't too difficult, it seems every time we get stuck and are about to give up with get a brain spark and finish the puzzles. There are plenty of community ones to play, i'd say keep an eye on the comments and ratings for them as some are not great, but you see that with the rating. Definitely worth the money. Only downside I have is that it can make me feel a little motion sick after playing for a long time.	----->	-3

107528617	Graphics are eye-catching even though it doesn't require a high-end pc to play. Puzzles and riddles in this game are extremely tricky and it can make your head overload. After all, this is a perfect choice for someone who loves pushing the brain to its limit. 10/10P/s: Grab a friend with you, it would be much more enjoyable.	----->	3
107528917	This is one of the best puzzle games I have played. Imagine like 20 escape rooms, all for $15, that's what this game WOULD be if it wasn't even better than that, because there are tons of user created levels too!	----->	6

107538496	This is by far the best Escape Room Experience on PC!Really nice to play with some friends, or in my case, my daughters.I did have to buy the game three times of course for that to work, but we're having so much fun that it's totally worth it!Yes, there are some bugs, most notably sometimes the multiplayer desyncs, causing people to see different 'states' of the room. That happens sporadically though.What does happen more often, is that sometimes after one person has interacted with an object (eg. tried to solve a puzzle, but failed because you don't have all the hints yet), other people can no longer interact with that object. For example, there is a pipe-puzzle in one room. There are many pieces of pipe. If I touched (moved) on piece, someone else can no longer move that piece. So, then you really have to work together to solve the puzzle, because some parts can only be moved by some people.A minor annoyance though, because it is really the best Escape Room Experience possible!Also, the included maps are all very small, but the user generated rooms are often very large and are really of high quality, so this is a game you won't finish any time soon!	----->	11
107542359	This game is super fun and just the right amount of challenging. Grab a friend to play with and have fun struggling to figure out fun puzzles. It works your brain and creates a sense of superiority when you figure something out. I only wish they would add more rooms to escape since I completed all of the existing ones in a couple days. :) Happy escaping	----->	12

The motion sickness settings are very welcome (I don't use VR, but the first person view on this was a bit much), and the letterbox is surprisingly helpful. It also has player-made levels, although so far I haven't found any that are up to the quality of the dev-made levels. I look forward to making a few myself!	----->	6

107722313	Decent for a while, but far from great. Giving it the thumbs up due to having spent so much time on it. But it really does have some serious issues. The biggest problem is that stuff just crawls to a near stop once you have a large population. Builders are assigned in absolutely horrible ways, resulting in build times and overall travel times for population that see them lose all their happiness on their way to work. This seems to be near impossible to avoid without ridiculous amounts of micro management. Other than that it plays like a lot of similar games from the later years. Lacks polish and challenge levels are not really great. It feels like a game that needed another year of polish just to get the small stuff right, adding a few more options for building the keep etc. But that is all OK, the insanely slow late game isnt. 	----->	-4

107762584	Coming from grid-based city builders like . . . well, all of them . . . to Foundation is just delightful.  Not having to build roads or put housing down is just so much gameplay easily done away with.  If you're like me and trouble about the placement of every building and road, Foundation is wonderfully freeing.   The city builds up organically with lots of charm.  Once some of the quirky aspects of the game (such as how building 'parts' work along with the build menu for each building), your city is quite easy to get rolling. Foundation is a pure sandbox, at the moment at least.  There are no survival aspects or diplomacy issues, no catastrophes to mess with your building plans.  A relaxing, if not terribly challenging game. Most city builders make building houses the fulcrum of the game.  Without houses, you don't have citizens or a birthrate, without an expanding citizenry, you can't expand the infrastructure needed to support them.  A true tail-chaser design that almost all city builders employ as you delicately balance a careful expansion of your citizens to expand your infrastructure to expand your citizen base.  Miscalculate and the whole comes tumbling down.  That's the core game play of almost all city builders no matter what environment or challenges they present.  Foundation does away with all that by having you designate residential areas wherein your citizens build their own homes, expand their own homes and upgrade their own homes as they see fit without your having to micromanage housing one bit.  You have the power to promote them to greater level of needs (newcomer, serf, commoner, citizen) that you must plan for, but so long as your citizens are happy, more and more will immigrate to your city, allowing you to expand and build as long and as far as you like.  All and all I found this a very enjoyable game.  There are downsides.  The bigger your realm gets, the slower construction becomes, which makes the early gameplay much more satisfying and immediate, while later gameplay plods along unnecessarily.  The Splendor mechanic is not explained and it takes a while to understand how it works and how to get it, which is fairly simple.  The Masterpiece monument construction is not explained and seems pointlessly arcane. Trade in the game works very well early on, but is too limited later in the game, with only 3 or 4 trade partners and no way to expand trade past that.  The war mechanic is repetitive, but works fine for acquiring Kingdom splendor (through building Keeps), money and goods (by going on missions) and as a convenient dump for excess citizens by turning them into soldiers. Foundation core gameplay is excellent, but it desperately needs a connection to the greater world.  Looking back at the classic Sierra city builders, a wharf that connects to the unseen world, buys up your excess goods and brings hard to find items might be just the thing.   Builders slightly more concerned with doing their jobs with dispatch would certainly make the later parts of the game go far more quickly and with greater satisfaction.  Considering the solid and off the grid gameplay, this game belongs in any city builders library.	----->	14

107772210	A pretty good simulation of an escape room. There is a lot of variety with the puzzles and style, and probably about 10 hours of official rooms to play, Plus about another 8-10 hours of DLC rooms if you buy those. And there are a practically unlimited number of community rooms, but the community rooms are hit or miss: some cool and creative ones, and a lot of meh and a few complete garbage.I've played a lot of escape room games here on Steam now, and this is one of the best values in terms of content per $. And the developer seems committed to continuing to update it so it keeps getting better and better.Highly recommended!	----->	11

107785712	The Price really is a Part that drives Players away. Its hard to convince frineds on a 22€ Game if youre looking to just explore the game a bit.Something that is overlooked is the insane Depth this game offers. Watching Tournaments really shows how complex this game can be. I´ve watched a 6 hour Tournament and have barely seen a Strategy used twice. Seeing the Level of Mindgames in Spyparty isnt comparable to any other competitive competitive Game i have seen so far.What this game Lacks is probably exposure and a decent Playerbase. Running into the same handful of People everytime limits you from seeing different playstyles and learning from them. It is disappointing seeing a game with a huge potential like this go unseen. This is hardly a Game you can just pick up and play. Mostly because of its pricing its hard to get more people to play it. Which is what you want to have in a game like Spyparty	----->	3

107804266	This is a wonderfully faithful adaptation of real-life escape rooms. Totally true to form in terms of puzzles, tone, themes, etc. As someone who's enjoyed dozens of real escape rooms, this one has higher quality puzzles and better production values (albeit virtual) than many... and none of the maintenance issues with broken puzzles or malfunctioning clues.It's super fun with a couple of friends, especially if you typically play in real life together too. Funny seeing how people resort to their real escape room personas even in the virtual world, separating themselves out into lone wolves, collaborators, quiet-in-the-corner recluses, overseers, etc.Can't wait to get into the level editor and make some rooms myself. Strongly recommended.	----->	10

107816054	This is a pretty cool game, I got this to play it with one of my friends and they are really fun and quick little puzzles. They are not overly difficult or anything like that except maybe finding the tokens those are hidden really well sometimes. You can also play rooms made by other players which is nice. The game tends to run pretty well the only thing I would say is that there are a few things that need to be patched or fixed; one of the things is how if you throw items in a certain area of the rooms they can disappear (happened once or twice for me), and there's one room where you can't get one of the tokens on the floor but I am sure that will be fixed soon enough. Aside from that I would recommend this if you like escape rooms and want to play it with a couple of friends and end up yelling at each other to show u what clues they are holding lol	----->	15

107841667	I purchased this game shortly after Christmas 2021 and it's now the 12th of January.  I've logged 25 hours in and the game keeps getting better.  This is MORE than just a colony sim, it's truly a game with, Quests, an economy that has meaning, military campaigns and much more. All of this and it's still in Early access.  Highly recommended.	----->	0
107846354	Quite Good. Just go and play it	----->	0
107847563	This is a fun, challenging, and all round really good escape room game. The levels provided by the developers strike a good balance between being difficult and achievable. There are also plenty of levels created by the community that you can download from the workshop. I tried playing in co-op, but I find it much more enjoyable to play by myself, it makes solving the puzzles feel more rewarding.	----->	4

107877991	It is a good escape game, for those who are used to this type of game it is not overly difficult but still challenging. Only downside are the controls, a little counter intuitive and hard to focus where you want to interact sometimes. I've seen many people complaining about motion sickness, I'm playing using a touchpad and haven't had any issues.	----->	-1

This is one of the best games of this type (that I found) and I enjoyed all the levels - also going for 100% completion :)I am an avid escape room player IRL and I liked that these rooms seemed to be based on the types of puzzles you would actually find inside and also the fact that you can design your own room, or play the community made ones - fun never ends.	----->	12

107942727	Absolutely beautiful game. Very nicely polished. The Devs have an active website, roadmap, Trello. This looks like it's been 3 years in the making and it clearly shows, everything is smooth and fluidic. I LOVE the idea of assigning areas for woodcutting, gathering, farming and housing. MY GOD HOUSING IS SO COOL! No more arbitrarily building homes yourself, you just allocate residential areas and watch them build and upgrade their own homes over time. Positively beautiful! PRO TIPBuild the sheep farm and spam the absolute sh*t out of the spawn sheep button and watch a lovely little Easter egg from whichever Dev dealt with that building and also unlock a nice secret achievement ;) I cannot get over how quickly I fell in love with this game.Everything looked to be so confusing but EVEN THE BUILDING ROTATION AND PLACEMENT TOOL IS SO GOOD I have uni deadlines and imma bout to fail for this and I don't care ❤️	----->	12

107954391	Wonderful game. Lots of fun for a long time. Hoping more updates and additions will keep the feeling going.	----->	5
107955315	Not a bad game. Has issues with being able to see what your doing. The camera positioning is always a major issue for me, especially in higher resolution range (5760x1080). Would like to see an option to make objects invisible or something to help viewing angle. Also, game does not work well with high sensitivity gaming mice. It's next to impossible to get consistent response with the Logitech 502. Overall it is a fun game. Custom maps are a great way to keep the game fresh and fun. Just hoping some updates will come out to fix the issues I'm having.	----->	11
107957193	Is honestly the best puzzle game I've ever played and is better than portal 1 and 2	----->	5
107959221	Would recommend!! Whether you have friends or not, its easy to play, easy to get into and has the ability to invoke healthy amounts of stress and relaxation as you play xD. GET YOU SOME GOLF IT!!!	----->	6
107962928	Really fun but a LOT of stuff gets desynced, showing up differently for clients vs the host. Good example is the pipe puzzle at the end of the Space rooms, some of the pipes got rotated incorrectly for the friend I was playing with.	----->	4
107968434	Loving puzzles and being isolated during my first bout of covid, this game has been a fun challenge. I love the ability to explore everything and even break things. I've also never been to an escape room, but always wondering if I would enjoy it or not. Playing this by myself has been so fun and lets me know i would enjoy a real escape room immensely. I also can't wait to play it with my family. I think this is a game even my father would enjoy!	----->	14
107971469	Such a great game! Loads of fun especially with the workshop content. Going forward this team should focus on optimization of the game itself because I don't have a 3090 but I have a pretty moderate PC but was experiencing really hard FPS lag. It should be noted that I am experiencing heavy lag in the community maps aswell.	----->	6
107980381	Fun to play coop! Pretty good puzzles, and lots of interactable objects / red herrings / easter eggs to find. When I play solo for a long time I get really nauseated, but in groups in the short stints needed for every room it's fine. I think fitting more than 3 characters in a room might be tricky -- we played with 6 people, but most were just watching the stream and giving instructions rather than with characters in the small rooms.I wish there were more ways to individualize your character! Especially for playing coop, it'd be cute.	----->	4

Just the right amount of challenging, with an ever-present hint button for when something doesn’t quite click. 5 location themes, 21 stages, typically 15-20 minutes each. Puzzles themselves are unique to one another. Workshop content can prolong the game but they're never quite to the same high standard.	----->	0

108031713	Amazing game. I was anxious at first due to my claustrophobia, but the Devs made sure there were open spaces to look at, windows, etc. to not make us feel trapped! Great game overall, amazing music.	----->	2
108037896	This is an OK game, I like it but There should be a function for set the scope of NPC operation and receiving R/M to production (builder, trader worker etc.) due to workplace of NPC is far from the site causing the operation is long time.	----->	2
108039141	Fun to play with friend, but too basic, short and lack of urgency (there should be death/game over in typical escape room when time is running out). Never tried the community puzzle, maybe someday when I have time and don't have anything to play.	----->	-3

108141557	Great game, pretty cheap and a lot of fun if you like escape rooms. Controls and gameplay are very straight forward so no issue there.The difficulty of the vanilla rooms is variable, some can easily be solved within the 12 minute timer on the first try, and some are a bit more difficult. The vanilla maps are also quite small so they feel more aimed towards solo than co-op.The level editor and community rooms add virtually infinite content with a lot of variety, including more complex and longer rooms with multiple levels that resemble real life escape rooms and are more aimed towards co-op.	----->	6

108151338	The game was fun, but it felt more kid-like than anything else. Plus, with three people, it was cramped in the small rooms they give you to explore, and the game says that it's best with 2-3 people. If anything, it's best by yourself, but even then it's a pretty boring game.What I DID like was the mechanics of the game overall. The details they put into it were really cool. I still wish it had a more realistic feeling instead of a cartoony look.	----->	8

108155081	Decent game, I've only completed the Egypt levels so far but really enjoyed it.There's a other themed rooms, 5 in levels in each theme plus workshop levels.  Difficulty can range from obvious to head scratching.  I wasn't sure about getting this at first as some of the reviews said it's more fun to play with others.  I'd mostly agree for any other game, but for this one I think I'd rather figure it out on my own.  I haven't played Co-op so can't say for sure though but I found single player to play just fine.Longevity will require  the community to keep making maps for the game because once you've completed the main rooms there's little point in doing them again unless you wan't all the secret tokens and beat the clock, not fussed about doing that.Overall, nice little game.	----->	8

108282664	I have had an itch to play an escape room with friends. I've done maybe 30+ escape rooms irl and the rooms are better than what escape rooms are providing with the 'Zoom' games they're running. The puzzles are very polished and well thought out. They build on top of each other, and each of the maps feel very different. The only issue I had were with the co-op screen share feature. Often times the mouse did not reflect where the user was pointing. I've gotten a lot of my friends to get the game and they usually have a question about replayability. There isn't replayability, but there are community maps so I'm hoping the game will still flourish.	----->	4
108284771	We had a lot of fun with this, some really interesting ideas at work and decent physics.  There is now a healthy library of user-made rooms and I have found some very fun ones.  Well worth the money if you like escape rooms.	----->	15
108285621	This game is literally so fun, I love escape rooms and so this is the perfect thing when I want to tingle my brain. Makes me think.	----->	6
108289706	Really fun game to play if you like Escape Room or puzzles game!The controls are fairly easy to pick up, even for PC newbies.Community maps make this game replayability almost endless! I do recommend! (Especially with friends! 4 co-op game fun!)The room creation aspect is more complex and way less friendly, since you are required to learn the logic and item placement to avoid creating bugs. If you ever did use Unity3D (Unity) development tool, this is basically it, inside Escape Simulator with some in-game interface making this less complicated for non-initiated (you don't have to know how to code in any languages!) Still fairly easy to pick up with a little investment (time) and watching some videos when required (Google/YouTube is your friend)Overall: Give it a good try! It is worth it!	----->	12

108312054	Lovely game with a good price.In a time where we are required to meet our friends in a virtual environment, Escape Simulator saves the day for people who love puzzles and escape rooms. The game comes with a fair amount of base scenarios, but the best part about this game is its robust level editor and workshop content that adds a ton of replayability for you or your friends to enjoy.	----->	12

Only had to check a guide 1 or 2 times for the entire game for puzzles that didn't seem to make a lot of sense.My only gripe is the limited amount of content that comes with the game, but the workshop has a lot of community-made maps, and for the price it's well worth it.	----->	7

108379610	Very good!!! It's escape rooms with puzzles. You can do all levels co-op and there's about 30 levels in the game, plus workshop levels. You can customize your character. If you want a harder challenge, you can turn off item hints in the options (on by default). There are also collectible tokens in each level and let me tell you, they are NOT easy to find, gives a bit of extra challenge to each room if you wanna find all 8. Overall, this game is a must for any gamer that likes puzzle games and added plus if you like escape rooms in real life.	----->	3
108386992	I give my recommendation on the basis of potential upgrades and changes being continually made to this title which is still in early access.Foundation is a Medieval take on Sim City and as such it has some of the good gameplay elements, but a handful of the frustrating elements as well.The Good: It's nice to see your city grow, to watch villagers upgrade their homes and flesh out your town.  Unlike Sim City however, you are given a (sometimes bizarre) name for each villager so that you can follow them from work to home, watch them shop etc.  This makes you feel a bit more connected to your settlement.The Bad: There are a lot of gameplay mechanics that aren't very well explained through the in-game help function so you'll likely be querying quite a few things in the forums to keep you progressing.  While it's a minor thing, you can't move your villagers homes and they do tend to like to build them in a disorganised lump.  While this will only upset your sense of organising your town and building it on your vision,  The Ugly: Your villagers, as helpful as they can be, the minute you promote someone beyond the rank of Serf, you're going to end up with constant demands for different foods, different goods and once you reach Citizens, they require luxury products as well.  Based on your villagers rank, their need for items will increase.  They will no longer be satisfied with just one type of food each day, they'll require two and the same goes for goods.Promoting a villager to the rank of Citizen is honestly only worth it for the access you'll get to different buildings.  The main ones being the Tavern, Monastery, Candle Makers and Common Goods.  If you have Citizens you will require the Monastery and Tavern to sate a Citizen's need for luxury items.  Despite the fact that the only luxury item production facility (Jewelry maker) is the only thing available to you with one Citizen promotion, Gems are way too rare to make this a viable way to produce luxury items for your Citizens.  The only way to ensure a regular source of Luxury is to have the Monastery.  While the Tavern is a good option, the high level Monastery is the only way to really produce luxury items on a townwide basis.  Knights are considered Citizen's too with regard to their needs.So while promotion is required to unlock all of the building items, as the game plays now, you won't want to promote anyone beyond the rank of Serf unless you're required to.  While a Serf is happy with one food item, Commoners and up require two, so if you have a village full of Commoners (this is the only rank at which villagers will begin to upgrade their homes), you will have to have huge amounts of goods and food resource creators or you will encounter a constant shortage of supplies.So basically, while this game is a lot of fun, the lack of tolerance in higher ranked citizens for waiting for stocks to be replenished on a daily basis and the claims that they have no access to comfort (because their home is being upgraded), drains your own patience really quickly.  This is to the point where the promotion system is literally only used to unlock buildings as the work ethic of Commoners and Citizens is not as good as the Newcomer and Serfs who are harder working.Hopefully they will consider modifying the promotion/rank system and the needs of villagers.  A day/night cycle would help the player keep track of the passage of time.  The ability to better control where your villagers decide to plant their houses down would be nice, such as the defining of pathways and 'roads' to be used by villagers to better structure your town generally.  Finally, the help guide needs to cover more information for the later stage gameplay options such as making a player aware of how regularly the tiers of villagers will require access to items.  How to access Blueprints.  Better construction options for Religious buildings and the Lord Manor so that in order to deal with your population and increased need for treasury funds, you don't end up with a building that looks like a haphazard blob as you're forced to add to it to accommodate everyone.This looks like I hate the game, but I don't.  I do enjoy it but it does require quite a bit more fine tuning to really make it what they want it to be and to make it enjoyable for players beyond the initial excitement of being able to promote, upgrade and build an army.	----->	41

108414390	Enjoyed this game so much puzzles are actually challenging and not just some easy escape simulator and can actually take quite some time to complete, and you can even play with your friends which is a great bonus too.

108433031	Some intense swings in fortune await you in this game.  Don't try to go too fast.  Always have extra or you will have too little.  Watch your supply lines and how to keep them operating efficiently.  The transporters will use the least effective supply line as it take more time!  Don't give them that option.  Smart planning takes several iterations of the game.  Don't be afraid to quit and restart when you have found out another 'secret' of the game.  Good luck!	----->	0

108499739	I played this game for a pretty long time to leave this review, so here we go. Ive never experienced any bugs or issues with controls, entities, etc. Thats what makes a great game, right? I had fun even though i never played with friends yet, which is also a good sign of gamedesign. I spent most of my time in the creator, but even there i tested my tracks and everything works fine. My Laptop seems to have issues with the water, but i guess i just need a better device, thats not a real problem for me. If other players with better devices had the same problem, id think about fixing that, but right now i dont see a problem. I dont have VR, but i can say with confidence that not only Golf it! is in early access, but also VR isnt on the full potential yet, no matter what VR Headset you're using. Its pretty impressive to make a golf game VR supported or trying to make it VR supported. I really love this game, as it has so many things that you can place and the abilities with that game-whatever category in the editor are nearly endless. Making a Minecart move over rails? No problem at all, you can also make it a timed event. I never advertise games, but this is one game that i would advertise when i grow on social media.I hope this was understandable and you have a nice day!	----->	28

108549859	It has it's charm, and there is a lot to like. But it has a very awkward supplies/distribution method that is to be fair lacking, villagers have the intellect of a mollusc with a spike in it's head, they refuse to build housing in areas that make sense to their location (work), their needs are near on impossible to cater to after an upgrade or two to status.So why a positive review? Like i said, It has a charm to it and has some really fun mechanics. Even if content is slightly lacking, given the attention and updates it needs this has potential to be something quite spectacular.	----->	7

108553559	It's such a relaxing game. Although it's definitely a part of the game, It's more about creating a visually appealing city, than focusing on making it bigger and better. I love it how the citizens make their own paths, instead of me drawing straight roads. This gives it a real vibe. You do have the power to force them in a certain direction with the 'painting/zoning' option. i love playing with this option. It is quite forgiving when you make 'mistakes'. That makes it a great change of pace. This is also the biggest downfall, as I can imagine some might find it boring.	----->	12

Enter game. trade one item, exit. etc. etc. etc. I have an extensive inventory but this trade in system I have to put up with isn't anything near fun or easy.	----->	5

108629332	The biggest concern with escape rooms in general is the reliance on thin logic and repetitive, boring puzzles. Escape Simulator avoids those common pitfalls while also providing a fun, stylized, and functional way to play alone or with a friend. The available rooms vary in style and puzzle types and the integrated workshop for community maps brings exactly what you'd hope for in replay value and long term content.	----->	-5

108647190	This has easily become one of my favorite games! This is my perfect puzzle game.While the story missions and puzzles are fantastic, you want the game for the Workshop! Infinite user generated content, many of which feel just as good to play as the story missions.I've been playing with several friends online, and we keep swapping maps between each other, and playing in small groups. I especially love the cooperative based custom rooms that require 2+ people.There are already so many creators that put incredible polish and design into their custom rooms, and the game is only 4 months old. New user generated maps keep coming out, and it keeps me and my friends engaged for hours on end.Now, the worst part about the game is how stable it is. I've been experiencing frequent crashes, or connection issues between friends. Many times, I have some friends that are able to walk through certain walls and objects with ease. Other times the game just crashes when loading a map. It's not stable, but when it works it works great. The positives	----->	12

108670519	Beautiful game with beautiful graphics. Definitely worth its price. It's like playing in a real escape room. There are features implemented that increase extremely the quality of life and make the game very easy and comfortable to be played together with other people. For example, when someone is holding a piece of paper with a message in it and reads it, the other players can click on it as well and read it at the same time. Each player has a cursor that is displayed to all other players, so when you talk to your friends, you can also point onto the piece of paper with your cursor and your friends will see it. Another example of quality of life feature is the pinging system. You can ping at stuff.And even if you finish playing all the rooms, there are Workshop rooms on Steam made from other people you can try out.PSA: Don't throw items off the map. You can't pick them up and you have to restart the room.Message for the devs: Maybe make the items that were thrown out of the room to be respawned in the center of the room after a few seconds (or instantly). The achievement can remain, no need to be removed.	----->	9

Foundation has a fluid and aesthetically pleasing UI.I look forward to seeing the development of this game.	----->	5

108786330	My friend and I were able to both hold a set of balls in our hands before placing them down to escape the room. They were really nice to caress, and it relieved a ton of stress on us before we broke out into our gay celebratory dance. My friend looks like Pedro from Napoleon Dynamite. You all should rate this review up for him. It would make his day. Vote for Pedro!	----->	5

108814848	If you're looking for a relatively bug free medieval city builder in early access, look no further. I love this game. I find it extraordinarily relaxing and every time I decide to reinstall it they seem to have made major progress on it. Managing resources and people with the new GUI is great. My only complaint is I wish It was easier to promote specific people by selecting a workplace. This way I can manage my vendors better to cater to more affluent citizens. Selecting housing or workplaces for this would be so much easier than scrolling through a giant list to find someone. Especially once you get to a larger city size.	----->	9

108862101	Love this game [b] BUT, AND ITS A BIG BUT [/b] (lol) the Co-op is pretty janky. My husband and I would be able to touch only some of the pieces in a puzzle and have to trade off to change items around in the puzzle or we wouldn't be able to work a puzzle at all and just end up directing the other person to finish the puzzle alone but not understanding what they want. Thankfully my husband could just walk in and tell me but the point is he SHOULDN'T have to. super cute game, actually some great challenges but co-op needs serious re-work, also love how crouch is just the characters fully taking a poo.	----->	10

108922513	The escape room every one needs in their life during trying times (covid). Lots of levels with a workshop for more.

Cons: None other than you're missing out if you don't get this game.	----->	-3
108923295	This game is a great small simulator for escape rooms. The base set of escape levels are okay, but the real content is all the custom levels created by the community and are free for everyone to try out! Some really big rooms can be created. Great game to play with some friends.	----->	3

108996173	Its a lot of fun! Feels surprisingly immersive and similar to a real escape room. In the beginning I didn't feel like 15 minutes per level was enough time but as I do more levels and get the hang of it I can finish them faster and faster and now 15 minutes is (usually) plenty.	----->	1

109096306	This game is honestly really good. There are a lot of levels built in but then you've got workshop which adds LOADS more. It's such a good game!UPDATE: after playing lots of custom maps, I can safely say this game is worth it...	----->	6
109097173	8/10+ Interesting and varied environments+ Not very repetitive+ Gives you a sense of achievement in building the villages and towns and seeing them advance- Some strange controls- You can end up in a situation where you have to restart the game as you have run out of moneyOverall, I really liked this game and I am likely to continue playing it. I thought it was really fun and I have spent hours on this game. As mentioned above, the controls are sometimes a bit strange, and I have also found myself (more than once) getting to a stage in the game where I have run out of funds and have to restart the game which is slightly annoying. Ultimately though, I really like this game and would definitely recommend it.	----->	9

109104845	I don’t do a many reviews, but this deserves one. This one really surprised me.  So while we were playing this I found my 10 year old son actually getting into this, so much even asking if we could play it. The puzzles were challenging at points, but not so much you were going to need a walkthrough to figure them out. It’s a nice relaxing play.[b]Pros[/b][list][*]Can be a challenge but it’s not so overly difficult you’ll find yourself looking things up.[*]Our son even enjoyed this, and found some of these puzzles enjoyable. [*]Community content means the game isn’t over when you solve all the built in rooms.[/list][b]Cons[/b][*]We played through mostly with a controller in the living room. In a couple spots I had to walk into the office and use the mouse as it was absolutely necessary (IMHO) to complete the task at hand.[*]Some of the hidden tokens might as well be invisible; we got some that we never even saw. We found by complete accident. Even after knowing where they are, I still don’t see them, the only clue they are there is the pointer changes.[*]I wish the hint system gave hints based on the task at hand. You may get stuck on the very last task. However if you haven’t taken any hints, it will still spit out hints for the very first item. [/list]Overall this one was really fun, and not really any major problems or complaints. Not to mention for the price, it’s a deal.	----->	-1

109169823	This game is great fun, we have sampled a few of the escape room games out there and some where okay but with no replayability and others where just terrible. This plays well and has workshop capabilities so you can get many more hours out of it. It has it's issue we found that sometimes you have to close the lobby because the game hangs on reconnecting when starting and a few extra features with controls and game play would be nice but that can be said about most games. if you have a group of friends convinced them to buy this game you wont be disappointed.	----->	3
109170969	Highly recommended for puzzle lovers!	----->	2
109171485	All I know is if I get trapped in an Escape Room, I will die in the Escape Room.These are hard! Feel like a real dumb dumb. So glad the hint button doesn't have a sarcastic 'Are you kidding me? It's right there!' remake every time you press it.The visuals are easy to look at which I prefer than The Room games as I find those really dark at times. The escape rooms are small rooms but there's a lot to unlock and find in them so it doesn't feel your going from one end of the room to another working things out.Only spent a little bit of time on it to get the hang of the controls but I can see it been an enjoyable game to play when I want to relax and want to focus on something else rather than overplaying in my head of how crappy my day was.	----->	-3
109183862	the game is extremely fun and exciting.Honestly i believe that its perfect for two people, but playing with 3 is fine. the puzzles are innovative and mind-teasing, the game play is smooth and the themes are very creative .	----->	11

109191251	I'm not a huge puzzle fan, and I've always disliked escape rooms (at least the ones in China. I've always found them impossible to solve). Escape simulator, however, is acceptable for me. The official rooms are difficult, but not impossible, and can actually be solved by humans. There aren't however, that many official rooms. This is made up by the fact that there are a lot of fan made rooms, which are also very fun to play.	----->	8
109199720	This is currently the best implementation of a escape room experience on PC. The length of the game itself is a bit on the short end, but the workshop content makes up for it. Although the content is nowhere near as good as the first party content.If you liked The Room series, chances are you'll also like this. This has a much lighter tone, no overarching story line, and adds coop gameplay.	----->	10

I don't really get why they didn't just implement a standard FPS camera. Probably to make the rooms feel more life-sized? This isn't helped by the nauseatingly repetitive music (especially in the Egyptian rooms), though you could just turn off the music to be fair.I will have to refund the game personally, but I would still recommend giving it a try.	----->	3

109290115	This is my first steam review and rightfully so.  The puzzles in this game are extremely creative and are a joy to solve.  I've only played with friends and it's been a great time, but I can imagine it being plenty of fun solo too.  I bought it for my old man as well, he needs the brain exercise.	----->	12
109290858	great game overall	----->	3
109292710	If you like puzzle games that are challenging but that can be solved using deduction and logic, I highly recommend this one. While I've only played a small number of escape room type games over the years, such as the Room & Portal series, I enjoy puzzle games, particularly when there is ample variety and innovation.While there may only be 15 rooms to complete over 5 levels,  each setting provides a fresh and engaging experience with slightly greater difficulty as you work your way up the levels.Admittedly, the core content could do with an expansion pack, however the longevity of the game is aided by a community map section with additional rooms created by fans. That said, I've only tried a couple of them but found the difference in quality between them and the official rooms to be quite stark.	----->	10

109327339	Take my money! It's an amazing game. It's way to cheap for what you get. They should bring out DLC's or whatever, or take money for new levels they put on there. It's way to cheap for what you get. I would have paid at least double the amount that i paid for it.	----->	4

109428485	Game starts out pretty simple letting you get the feel for the puzzles and different things that can be done but as you go on it seems a lot more challenging whether your with or without friends the games a fun mind bending experience. Multiplayer is also another fun factor I'd say because it requires communication and you can get more done at once but on the other hand it doesn't help when your friend forget they're holding last item needed (barbie) in any case it's all around fun with nice design great ideas and cool backgrounds involved try it out if your into puzzles for sure!	----->	21

109520771	I just can't get enough of this game! I love escape rooms in the real world, but with the global pandemic, it's hard to get together with friends to try them out. Plus they come with a large price tag! But with a one time payment that's similar to your monthly rate for a streaming service, you can get endless amount of playing time thanks to the in-game builder. With the help of the growing community of players and creators, I have a large selection of user-created rooms in the community workshop to choose from! It's amazing how creative some creators can be with their creations. The best part is I get to try them all out with my friends who I can't see very much. It is still a fairly new game, so I can't wait to see what future updates will bring to it!	----->	15

Would have to rate it 10/10.. you get exactly what you paid for.	----->	4
109537740	I played for five hours after spending $11 on sale and I find the trade off worth it.

109551070	Played this as a duo, finished all 5 maps (with 5 rooms each) which took about an hour each. It was fun, but they definitely need to add more maps. It is quite a new game, so I'm hoping they will update often with new maps. I'm also hoping that they make the rooms a bit bigger, because it already felt quite clustered with 2 people in a room.Some puzzles were straight forward, some were confusing with barely any explanation. Had to use hints a few times, although some hints were pretty useless like the ones that point at something we already found. I think out of all the rooms, we only had 2 rooms where we found all the tokens. Finding all the tokens is definitely harder than the game itself lol.There isn't many escape room games out there but this one seems the best so far. It is visually pleasing, only encountered 1 bug. We need more escape rooms!!!	----->	5
109561596	I was skeptical at first but its a really well made escape room game. It feels pretty real, playing with friends makes it much more fun considering the amount of confusion some of the rooms created. Really enjoyable game, can't wait to play more	----->	2

109605680	Pretty fun. It looks pretty and the puzzles are okay for the time limit. Let's just hope I never have to rely on the hints in real life, because they're useless unless you're five hints in. You have all items in your hand, you can read (yes, reading the collectibles is a dedicated hint), and yet you're missing what you're supposed to do - shame the game doesn't recognize that. It means you need to start pumping out hints the second you get stuck, otherwise the timer is done by the time you reach a useful hint.	----->	2
109606011	This game has hours of play and is especially addictive if you like city and settlement builders. It also has a community of skilled creators and an extensive library of great mods to enhance the game. The only feature I keep wishing for is a button or shortcut to undo the last action in case I accidentally delete something.	----->	4

109606177	The Name is Programm ! If you like Escape rooms you will have lot of superb Contend here. Also it Simulates the experiance of an real room really well.

The Workshop levels are really well made by the Communtiy.At best with 2-3 Friends in Coop, but also Solo is the game fun.Dont  expect any Story or something like that form this game.

109687453	This is probably the best city builder game I've played since Banished came out almost a decade ago. Right from the start the controls and menus were intuitive and familiar enough to make it easy to pickup.

Can't recommend this game highly enough.	----->	14

But I still think that golf with your friends is a fun game for less experienced people or those who are really laggy	----->	9

109730796	Good:- cute and relaxing- finally a builder with decent roads and altitude building (ish)- The right amount of autonomy for workers and where they settleBad:- if you are min/max rather than an enjoyment player, this is not for you -> mechanics are limited on not very deep- lack of meaningful goals -> there is no purpose to any of this, and there are not many beats to mark your journey- The character art style is not pretty and somewhat devoid of personality (not terrible, but not immersive either)	----->	1

109741041	If you're looking for a deep, super logistical and calculating city builder that's easy to loose and hard to master, this isn't it. If you want a pretty, wide, relaxed city builder that organically builds towns that slowly become bustling metropolises with grand buildings you designed lording over your town, this game is for you. It's relaxing, slow, and often like watching an ant farm while your giant constructions get built. But it's also great fun that always makes me forget what time it is when I play.	----->	14

109753170	Despite a few 'buggy' annoyances - the game is hugely playable. It's very easy to lose hours playing the game and enjoying the ambience - so I highly recommend this to those who like a little less stressful game play. As to the 'bugs' mentioned above - with the latest release it seems very easy to get into a situation where you can't acquire new upgrades because the game demands the resource you'd get from those upgrades.   Fish in particular. I kept getting Priests asking for Fish, to feed the Labour - which I couldn't give to them  because I couldn't unlock fishing... despite being on the coast. This ruined several initial games. Other bugs include the UI - where building appear and disappear for no apparent reason (and yes, I had the resources to build them and any other requirements) . If this is some sort of 'on demand' idea then it doesn't work - you cannot plan ahead with an 'on demand' system. Also, in the 'show all' section of the Build UI - kindly fix the search function - or at least assign each building multiple keywords so that they appear when a search is made.	----->	3

109788908	After a little more than 20 hours playing Foundation it is one of my favorite games ever! The natural placement of houses and the tools you have to build unique edifices just makes this game 10x better than most other city builders I have played. I also happen to be a medievalist historian PhD candidate and can say that this game does its due diligence to be close to some of those medieval aspects that we have all come to appreciate in the historical community. I also love the fact that you can really pan down close to the roads and navigate in between your villages like you are in a first person mode. It makes this game so much more immersive and enjoyable when you can appreciate your towns up close. If you have the money, GET THIS GAME! There is an unlimited amount of playability because of the unique features this game has and so one game will never be the same as the next! Pair that with the great modding community that has evolved around this game and you will not be disappointed! Maps, building, and other great additions through mods add a whole extra level of immersion. Please give this game the chance it deserves! I am a HARDCORE city builder gamer and I have been for many years now. I used to play Banished nonstop when I was younger and if that was a game you loved then GET ON BOARD WITH THIS ONE!	----->	25

There are some very talented people in the community producing new maps every day. Solo & co-op friendly.I have encountered some bugs and glitches along the way (items dropping through floor, clipping through walls are probably the big two) but nothing that game-breaking and as the game is still fairly new, I'd expect them to be patched.	----->	4

110042550	If you are an experienced escape room player in real life or just curious what they are all about, this is the game for you.  A great series of puzzles and well-designed rooms that really get your brain working.  Simple and intuitive interface and controls.  The mix to solve the puzzles, find all the clues and the race to beat the timer gives you challenges on multiple levels.  With the multiplayer and user-built rooms will keep you coming back for more.  Looking forward to the next series of rooms.	----->	4

110060773	Great game to play with friends (or alone), it has a workshop where the community can post escape rooms, so this can keep the game from dying in the long run which is good.Graphics are nothing special, decent cartoonish style.Sound design is alright, nothing special.Gameplay and Control are a bit janky, the space you have in each room is too small that turns the coop game into a claustrophobic cluster fk, they should've added 1-2 meters to each direction to make it more spacious, keybindings are missing mouse featues (middle mouse, forwardackwards) which sucks, and the keybindings themselves are rather confusing, and don't explain what they're doing or how to use them, albeit there's only 1-2 keys that I still have no idea what is their usage. They could improve on the default key bindings imo, it's very confusing having many shared buttons instead of dedicated (although you can remove them).Character customization is limited, you can only chose from 1-3 items (hat,clothes,gender,skin color, hair & facial, haircolor) , I couldn't find any way to get more clothing atm, hope they add in the future more items.My biggest annoyance is the lack of marking where you can use certain items, which causes you to just pixel check everything with an item until you see it is usable at some place, and there's many duds to confuse people and are there just to waste your time.Overall it's a solid 7\10 game.And a great replacement for the real thing considering the current global health state.	----->	0

110073916	More fun with co-op, because of the interaction and different points of view from different persons.  What seems baffling to one person is sorted out by another.  Some replay value, owing to the finding of tokens, and also getting all the trophies.  We hope to see expansion packs with  more levels, and also more options for customizing your players.  One thing that we would REALLY like to see is the ability to re-map the mouse buttons to other functions.	----->	10

110318565	I was interested in getting a relaxed city-builder, and didn't wanna get into the Settlers. I checked this one out and watched some gameplay and reviews and then bought it. It's a fun game, slow paced and relaxed. The early quests will help you get into it and figure out how things are connected. Unless you try to expand too quickly or lose sight of your finances, it shouldn't be too hard to get a steady flow of goods and income going. After about 3 hours, I had expanded to about 4 zones and had many of the buildings producing goods, with money coming in at a steady pace. The interface is easy to understand and not too cluttered. I really like this one...  I can't judge yet how much long term motivation there is to be had or whether you run out of content quickly, but so far, I am enjoying this game whenever I feel like chilling with a nice citybuilder. Therefore - I recommend it.	----->	22
110324334	Although the replay-ability is pretty much non-existent the game delivers on game play vs cost.

110375464	This is a great lazy builder. I leave it up most of the day and just play it randomly when I have time. The only thing I wish is that there was an easy setting that has zero barriers to just building at your hearts content. Sometimes the barriers that are meant to make the game challenging are just annoying to someone who is trying to build a village and doesn't care about difficult. Still, I'd suggest this game to anyone into these types of games.	----->	3

110380196	I played through this with someone else and we had a great time! The puzzles were fun and clever, and the themes were neat, too. It definitely scratched that escape room itch for me. We did have some minor issues with what was either weird de-sync or a multiplayer bug. Sometimes what I saw on my screen would not match what was on my partner's screen. E.g. An item in a puzzle would be rotated differently for me than them. It definitely didn't ruin the game—just added a bit of extra challenge. =)I highly recommend this title for fans of puzzle games and escape rooms!	----->	3

110395455	It's a very immersive medieval city builder but calling it that doesn't do it justice, its a very well-oiled micro and macro economy management game, you can almost get attached to the citizens if you try, but overall you are building a whole kingdom, unlike other city builders there is very little grid or tile based building and the sky is the limit as far as what you can customize for the modular buildings. The only drawback that i have kind of observed is that there is sort of a little bit of staleness to the game after a while, having unlocked all of the achievements at this point i'm not sure i will pick it up again at least for a little while. but this is still in beta and I can honestly say that i have enjoyed it and look forward to seeing what happens in the future, but i think it needs some more resources (armor, medicine, maybe some other goods, and luxury items, maybe horses to increase speed of transportation, cattle farmers should also be able to produce meat like boars ), some more buildings (stable, hospital, armorer (or make smiths  also produce armor), university) more demands form citizens, and maybe some better mechanics for transportation  and increasing learning speed, also some more consequences and disasters, less wash-rinse-repeat as far as game play, through some crazy shit in there every once in a while like an angry mob that your soldiers have to deal with or maybe some invaders or wolves to keep people guessing about whether their town is going to survive.	----->	-1

110511917	I've had and played this game intermittently almost since it was first made available in early access, and I guess it's time for a review.Foundation is a relaxing city builder where planning and logistics lay at the heart of the gameplay. Similar titles would be the Settlers series, or even Cities Skylines. It can be quite unforgiving, in a good way, until you figure things out. Not as unforgiving as games like Banished can be - you'll usually be able to see where you're going wrong reasonably quick and start and try to remedy it before it's too late. The game is still in early access, which explains the lack of end-game activities. Once you've established your city and built all the buildings, there isn't much to do and things very rarely go wrong. The developer is regularly shipping new updates though, which gives you reason to return every few months and experience the newest additions. Looking forward to the full experience when it leaves early access!	----->	1

110521858	This game is absolutely awesome. You can finish the developer created maps in a few hours with a friend, but where the game really shines is in the community/workshop created maps. The game has only been out for 4 months at the time of this review, but it already has over 1900 community base maps. It is an almost endless puzzle game because of this. If the game devs keep on the path of supporting the community created maps and their developers, this game will be extremely good for a long time.	----->	4

110589992	Escape simulator is brilliant. Fun, engaging puzzles created with no repetition of core ideas across levels, keeping things fresh and unique. It also has a user-friendly editor where players can create their own escape rooms with easy to navigate menus and logic systems, with more advanced options for those who have more elaborate room ideas. All developer made puzzles have a great balance of difficulty without being too complex -hints are supplied if you are truly stuck- 8.5/10.	----->	4

For me the most valuable asset of this game is the room editor and what will make this game a big success is if the flexibility of it is good enough to create diversity in the designs of the community made puzzles.If the community of room editors grows and the room editor evolves, there is a good chance that this game will stay installed for years to come.	----->	16

Dislikes: Sometimes the mechanics get a bit buggy, and the FRIGGING BONUS TOKENS (they're challenging to find, and tend to blend in with the scenery all too well.)I would like to know more of the lore for the bonus tokens as well, and hoping they're meant to ... i don't know... purchase something? Like more rooms, ala rareware games from back in the day? Unsure. 	----->	7

110775946	Enjoyable but somewhat buggy game that scratches that puzzle itch.Pros:*Fun escape rooms*Variety of colorful environments and objects to interact with (and to make your own levels)*Many available levels in the steam workshop, which range from childish to devilish making it  suitable (with screening) for most ages and abilities*Rarely (if ever) requires outside knowledge to complete the puzzles*Most levels contain some kind of hint systemCons:*Not many levels included in the base game*Not a lot of replay value for the levels.  *I've run into a lot of buggy workshop levels...getting stuck in walls, dropping critical items through floors and walls, and just general freezing.  Not sure if it's the game itself,  or workshop only.*There's no way to save, so you can't take a break and come back later.  Bugs mean a total and frustrating restart.	----->	-6

110884281	It’s exactly as it says on the tin. It’s an escape room game. A damn fine one actually. There’s no fluff here. Just rooms that need to be examined, with puzzles that need to be solved -- revealing new puzzles that also need to be solved. Do it quickly for bonus points. Collect all the hidden collectibles for [i]even more[/i] bonus points. If you’ve ever been in an escape room before, real or virtual, you’ll feel right at home. Even more so with a friend in tow. There’s no storytelling. You won’t find hidden lovecraftian lore, like in the Room games. It’s just a giant puzzle box, dressed up in a somewhat superfluous theme for color and immersion.The fact that it’s so true to its concept makes me happy. I know exactly where I have it. And if I ever need to scratch that itch, I know where to go. It’s an easy recommendation to just about anyone who [i]thinks[/i] this might be up their alley. With such an active focus on community made content as well, I foresee this thing living a long time, with a lot of content to come.Highly recommended if you want a simple, clean escape room simulator.	----->	5

110908558	The game is very fun! I would've loved if there were more stages that were not community made but overall I like the game.There are a few performance issues. I struggle with lag on bigger community maps and even on some of the original maps there were some performance issues when we took too long.Would've loved if there were a few more customization options for your character too.I think overall I really enjoyed the game and it was worth the price! I highly recommend playing it with friends, it's way more fun co-op.	----->	13

111006483	[h1] Fun alternative to irl escape rooms [/h1]I love doing escape rooms, but for obvious reasons that's a bit tough to do right now. But this game is a great alternative and it takes out some of the more difficult/hard to manage parts of irl escape rooms. Planning a group activity and wondering if you're going to get trapped there forever!The puzzles are a nice blend of tricky and self-explanatory, and they tend to be very tactile (or as much as they can be in a game). The graphics are simple, but they make it work. Your can run it on a laptop and it still looks good.I want a VR version.	----->	5

111016994	It's a 1-room escape room game and I liked it.Dated 25th feb 2022Pros:- Aesthetically very pleasing but simplistic and cartoony (various era styles for rooms).- Game comes with many rooms to play in.- Room editor to make your own or play community made rooms (more styles than in vanilla, they didn't use the existing medieval style design in vanilla puzzle rooms at the point of review so expect way more than what's already in the game).- There is hint box that help you progressively for every current task so you're guaranteed to not be stuck.- Coop exists and it has good coop mechanics when playing (you can look into the object that the other player is currently holding up).- The puzzles themselves aren't repetitive (I don't remember feeling like I'm doing the same task again and again even if realistically a lot of it is the same mechanic in essence).Cons:- Rooms are small and few puzzles per room.- Some puzzles hide the answer in background where you don't expect to see it (god damn rooms lit in the shape of numbers).- You have to share a lobby code to play coop, there's no public lobby where you can play with randoms.- You're sharing the few puzzles in coop and absence of randomness (number/answer randomizer) will lower replay value unless you resort to community puzzle rooms or are 1st-timers.- Coop griefing - Items (a player could hold an item that is required to decipher a puzzle and not share it with you)- Coop griefing - Shortcuts (in a few vanilla maps you can unlock the exit by knowing the password and since that's not randomized you can do a 3 second speedrun)- The official discord channel requires phone number input.Conclusion:As a puzzle room game this was a very pleasant experience especially if you enjoy a 1-time run through it.A certain feet loving shark introduced me to it.	----->	7

111114546	What an absolute gem of a puzzle game! Escape Simulator is super fun and works just like a real life escape room! The puzzles are very logical, and good communication is needed if you're playing with someone else. Don't worry, there are clues available if you get really stuck, so you can always finish each room :) There are hidden tokens to find as you work through the rooms, and this adds variety to the game play. Once you've finished the standard rooms, there's also a workshop mode. You can create your own escape rooms, or play through other people's creations - you'll never run out of things to do! Highly recommended and lots of fun - thank you!	----->	18

111229475	Bought this game at its original price and I can say that it is more or less rightly priced.[h1]SPECS[/h1]This game can be run on low specs pc but you [b]need to lower the graphic settings[/b]. [b]Public escape rooms are a no go[/b] for low end users as it becomes super laggy with huge fps drops and frame skips especially when looking at certain objects in the public room. This is probably due to it being a public level that the assets (game objects) aren't as smooth as the official ones and as such, are not as bearable for a low end pc.[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]The game really digs deep into your brain where you [b]don't need to have prior knowledge of anything[/b] but you only need to be observant, be able to differentiate between real clues and red herrings, and to be creative or have problem solving skills. Levels are categorized by their theme and there are no explanations about the levels, like the difficulty of the puzzle.The other side of the coin is the gear pieces which is a side quest where in each level there are 10 pieces scattered across the room and is optional to complete. You can choose whether to scour the whole room while solving it or after you've done so (I haven't collected all pieces for a single room).Another thing about the hints is that most of them [b]aren't really too helpful[/b] as the hint system is most likely to give you hints that you've already solved and thus wasting time due to the hints having a timer every time you use one (Note, I don't dislike the hints having a timer but about the hints not having a more 'written out' method of giving them out). The hints are also just a picture of what you need to do, highlighting the important parts with a red ink but some hints are not that understandable due to it just being a picture, this isn't much of a big deal though as this statement can vary from person to person where I might have hard time understanding some hints while others don't.By the time I posted this review, the game only has more or less 5 sets/themes of escape room including the tutorial (each having a varied number of rooms/levels) where the latest release, as far as I know, is the Christmas one. If you wanted to have a game that has days of gameplay then this is not for you, unless you want to try solving the escape rooms made by other players. This is a [u]good 6-12 hours of gameplay[/u] that racks up your brain where you can also invite friends (they must have the game downloaded) to also suffer alongside you. Although I [b]haven't tried the coop[/b] as I am the only who owns this game in my friend group.I [b]haven't tried creating a room[/b] of my own as I, myself, am not a good problem creator but from all the reviews I've read, it was quite easy to use linking puzzles and stuff where you can use in-game assets to decorate your room to fit a certain them.[h1]THOUGHTS[/h1]This is a fun game where I assure you that you would have tons of Eureka moments solving each room. Good game to play with for about 9 hours and can be a lot more fun if you have your friends with you stuck in the room. There aren't that many official levels so after you have completed the official ones, you'd have to find satisfying escape rooms from the public made by fellow players or you can try to make one and release it for everyone to solve.	----->	18

111233505	Well, the game is fun, with cool mechanics, and rules. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. And the Idea of the game is really cool. But there are some things you need to know before playing. The game uses the old Server Browser (like the old Counter Strike) and The Graphic is not what you expect  but it's acceptable.6.5 / 10	----->	1

111343190	 I'd give this game a 7.5/10. Overall a short game for what it is but priced about right and good fun with a friend - I find that there is a lot of thinking outside of the box and some levels are extremely challenging, Especially the space levels - Collectible tokens can be annoying to find because they're in the most obscure places and gives you more of a headache and becomes tedious rather than fun. Overall I enjoyed 100%ing this game and will look forward to doing the Community Rooms and playing with others. Recommend if you like puzzle games!	----->	7

111359874	A good game to play with pals. I just wish it wasn't so buggy :( Constantly losing connection, 'waiting for other players' etc, even when there isn't an issue. I would still recommend, but do know that it can act up sometimes. I also wish there was more content. I know that we have access to rooms that other players create, but I would love to see some more from the developers down the line.	----->	5

111472341	So fun. Just like being at an actual escape room, except you don't have to argue with your sibling about whether the item you just picked up is  an actual clue, or if it's just a weird key left by the people that did the room before you. Certainly could be fun with others, but honestly for people who are smart asses and know-it-alls (myself), it's great to complete room after room with no help from other people. Really gets the ego going.	----->	8

111586069	VR Review:   Immersive, Frustrating, Satisfying.  Exactly what mini-golf should be!  8/10 for now... good potential for higher.I don't see where some of the issues mentioned are coming from - it runs great, controls feel right and consistent (I'd like it to feel as heavy as an actual club, but hardly the games fault), teleport is easy, with option of auto or manual - This is on the Quest 2 at least, can't speak for other headsets.  Also the selection of courses is great, and all with a full 18 holes! I'm used to mini-golf games having 3 nine-holers, and I've not even delved into the workshop yet.Yeah, there are a few minor gripes, but it is early access, and seems to be an ongoing project, and they really are minor, not game destroyers.The main issue is when you teleport, but there is a workaround...The problem - Rather than move YOU to the chosen spot, it moves your 'area' to that spot.  The result is it sometimes pens you in to a corner, and only way to get near your ball is to stand right up against a wall/chair/desk/piano/dog.  It's tough to explain, but if you play you'll likely get what I mean.  Unless you have a lot of space and don't have obstacles right on the perimeter, in which case there's presumably no issue.The Workaround - just removing/putting the headset on standby, then moving back into clear space and turning it on again.  This seems to reset the 'centre' of your area, and that should last a good while before you have to do it again.One other annoyance is I cannot seem to find the scorecard mid-round.  I saw a patch yesterday that claims to have addressed this, but I still could not find it, but happy knowing it's coming, or that it's there and I'm just being dumb.All in all this is a great little game, and for an inconceivably fair price - A single round of mini-golf at the beach will cost you the same nowadays, and you can't do that while glugging a can of beer in a dressing gown, can you?!  At least you probably shouldn't.	----->	10

111652234	This is a great game to play with a couple of friends online. The community content makes this game special because new rooms are added daily. If you have played all of your local escape rooms, I suggest this with a few friends for some quick fun.	----->	2

111688950	This game is exactly what it sounds like, in a good way. You and your friends are thrown into a small room, and it's up to your puzzle solving abilities to get yourselves out. Can't be more simple, but oh boy is it extremely fun.The controls are simple, the visuals are charming, and the variety of different rooms and puzzles is overwhelming. Honestly, if you came to this page with even the slightest interest in escape rooms, this is the game for you.If you are still on the fence, my friend and I did a few youtube videos of our playthrough of a few of the rooms in the game, feel free to check it out if you have enough patience to sit through two idiots failing to solve fun and easy puzzles! https://youtu.be/jup0v2ll4a4	----->	11

Co-op works really well, or you can stream the game to your friends in Discord with only one person controlling it, so you're all on the same page.	----->	14

112176192	Honestly you're getting a bargain even at the base price. This game has content alright, the base game should already keep you busy for around 5~6 hours. Then you're treated with community maps and workshop maps, so tons of replayability on that note. Moreover, some of the puzzles are actually smart and I believe the difficulty is just right for all players, some puzzles will take more time than others but rest assured that as long as you looked, you would find the answer to the puzzle. The trash can function is probably the smartest thing about this game. It allows players to actually remove items from your vision and then you can focus on the main tasks. Anyhow, know that your decisions remain crucial, you are the one who decide what to keep and what to trash and obviously, as a good game should allow you to do, you will be able to recover the items from the trash can. This can help your playthrough tremendously, eliminating any distractions would only help you reaching closer to the final piece of the puzzle. A small hint to the people interested in this game, LOOK AROUND! LITERALLY!A good deal for what it has to offer. Also a great deal if you want to play escape room with friends online4/5	----->	23

112249011	This game is amazing. You unlock all of the buildings/structures relatively quickly in your playthrough(like 6-8~ hours), but I have come back for 4-5 playthroughs for the calm, admittedly easy growth of my town. If you are someone who likes frostpunk type games for their difficulty, then you may not like this. There is one difficulty, and once you get over the hump of being able to produce lots of excess goods to be able to trade them for a massive profit, the game is very easy. However, the joy I get from the game is seeing my villagers forge their own paths to give the game a really sprawling, medieval feel. I cannot express how happy this game makes me.Tldr; An AMAZING calm, easier city/resource management sim of organic growth, but lacks difficulty and endgame content atm	----->	13

112263153	Excellent game! I keep coming back to it. Partly because it is fun, but also because they are still making big changes. Changes that have thus far only improved the experience. I love sims.	----->	6
112266066	If you like room escape games, you can't go wrong with this one. The controls are mostly intuitive, the puzzles have a good range of difficulty, it looks good, and when you're done with the stock levels there's potentially endless user created ones.A helpful tip, it's not always best to keep everything in your inventory. If you need to visually compare items, or select certain items out of a stacked bunch, it can be easier to lay them out on a surface like a desk or shelf.	----->	10
112266362	a good trainer for patience if you put collision on.	----->	1
112273776	Such a fun game, great mechanics + tons of maps = endless content. Who could ask for more?	----->	7
112274686	I hate this game so much..... This game has ruined my friendships :,(	----->	-5
112294416	I love Banished and this relies on a lot of the same concepts while appearing to have more depth to the game play. For an early access game its a very positive start. The upgrade/edit system is really nice. I will say that the introduction and help section needs work. I'm losing Commoners because they don't like my housing and I have no idea what is actually wrong or what I can do to fix it. I also searched for a few other things in the Help and had to resort to the web (thanks Steam Community members for having the answers). Receiving statues and honorifics from my villagers with no way to build them and no idea how to get marble feels bad. It would definitely be better to have lower tiers of these items with upgrades. But I will keep playing, excited to see where the game goes.	----->	6
112296220	    Very fun little game and totally worth it if you buy it on sale, $15 seems a bit much.  The levels that are included in the game are very engaging and brilliantly designed.  I managed to get through all of them without cheating if you don't count slamming that hint button repeatedly on some of them, which is a testament to their intuitive design.  There is a respectable amount of these levels, but I wish there were a lot more of them.    Where the game fails is it's dependence on user-made levels.  I can see this as a fun way to make custom escape rooms for your friends.  However, when you compare the user-made rooms to the developer made ones even the highest-rated, most-downloaded rooms feel like a confusing-mess.  It's a shame the game seems to really push you to download these user-made levels too.    If the difference between $15 and $10 means nothing to you, go ahead and buy it.  Otherwise, I would wait for a sale because there is maybe 10 hours worth of developer made levels in this game and they seem to still be adding more from time to time.  As of the time of this review I have about 16 hours on record for this game.  That's about 8 hours having fun (maybe less) completing the included levels, 2 hours trying to make the user maps fun, 6 hours left the game running while I was doing other things.  hopefully, that can give you an idea of what to expect.	----->	14

112340954	Look, ADHD being ADHD, I don't exactly have an easy time with city-building games. The planning, having to pay attention to so many things at once, the micro-mananging, it all usually ends up giving me headaches after extended periods of time, even if the game is enjoyable to me.There have only ever been two exceptions : Pharaoh (a childhood game getting a remaster soon) and [i]this game[/i]. It is very much a more chill, laid-back city builder, and it nails the charm of a growing fantasy town very well, without being obnoxious about the details and tidbits you need to focus on. My only regret is not being able to play in multiplayer with my partner, but then again, some games do not require multiplayer to be good. To me, this is one of them.In terms of replayability, well I've only played 3 hours at this time : I know there are four maps, pretty much with the same terrain types, but with a few more geographical challenges, and modding support seems to be a thing. Otherwise, I cannot be of help for that, sadly. I do very much intend on playing more of this, however.Overall, not a purchase I regret. Now if you'll excuse me, I've played this until 5AM, I might be in need of sleep.	----->	3

112388442	This game has a lot of issues for an early access title. However it also has a lot of potential.it's an interesting combination of Banished, Universim and Tropico.You don't get to control your units directly. But you have to manually hire workers.You don't get to build houses, you assign residential areas. There's 3 factions you have to do quests for. Each offering their own rewards after having population milestones and enough reputation. There's a lot that needs improvement, the biggest issue is the manual saving. Which appears to temporarily freeze the game process. At least for me it does.	----->	4
112392804	Really fun!  And the community-created rooms are fantastic, too!  Well done all around.  If you like escape room games, this should scratch that itch.  There are lots of rooms and ways to play - play co-op or solo, beat the timer to get a trophy or relax and take your time, finding all the tokens or staying after unlocking the door to find tokens you missed, or replay the room entirely - etc.  I'm enjoying the community rooms right now and savoring the last section of the developer's game for later.  Great job, all!	----->	3

Foundation is a LOT more chill which is what i was looking for, I can just let the game run and hang out with my girlfriend. Villagers dont die, they just leave when they get unhappy. If you want Banished but a bit more forgiving, chill, and creativity-inclined vs. difficulty/technical survival mangament game, this is the one ive got so far, and its pretty good so far!	----->	4

112694184	Ever play a game like Anno Domini and wish you could just focus on building your settlement without having to jump between different islands or fight others? Do you like laying out a beautiful city in Islanders, but miss the depth of a resource management game? Then foundation lies exactly in the middle for you. Without direct attacks or threats or competitors, the game is sufficiently relaxed to let you do things at your own pace and enjoy the process. But it's not purely an aesthetic game, and you need to keep both eyes open on the economy and happiness of your settlement.Building up a medieval village step by step, putting together new production chains to meet the demands of higher social classes is simply rewarding fun. Major buildings are built component-by-component by the player to tailor them to their need and the available land, But also to look impressive in order to generate the Splendor needed to unlock new buildings. All that boils down to good town planning: how do I have my villagers close to the churches and markets they need, while being close enough to their work (but not so close to suffer their ugliness)?And this is what the game really shines; what could be called ludonarrative coherence. The things that _feel_ nice when playing are almost always the most _efficient_ way to play. It feels natural in a role playing way to have upper class citizens in the main urban settlements working high end jobs, while serfs toil in the fields in tiny outlying villages, and it's also a good way of running the in-game economy. I want my lord to live in an ornate manor with lots of high towers and large rooms, and the game mechanics reward me for doing so. Bigger churches are needed as your settlement develops, and the largest most decorated one will end up being in the central town square, just where I would want it. So many games in this genre require choosing between building a beautiful, realistic town and one that is efficient by the rules of the game; being able to do both at once is delightful.Be aware, however, that despite having been in EA for 3 years the game is very unfinished, with only 60% of the raw content currently present according to the devs. Housing upgrading is a big part of the game according to the tutorial, but there are only 2 tiers currently in. There's no stone keep/castle. Some of the resource production lines are completely unbalanced. Villager path finding occasionally breaks. The UI is smooth and intuitive, but occasionally lacking in vital information or the odd QoL tool-tip.All in all, if you want a medieval town planning game that blends beauty with efficiency, then you could do a lot worse than this. But if you want to play a complete game with all the content present, then you should wait. I think getting it when it's on sale and playing a run once every major patch or two is easily worth it.	----->	24
112697474	This game is good for all ages.  There are many different difficulty levels for a wide range of people.  The custom level editor is very thorough and allows for complex community content!

112790247	It does what it says on the tin very well. The only thing really holding it back is the relatively limited amount of first party content. The room editor and workshop support could *theoretically* make up for this in spades. However, my experience has been a bit hit-or-miss.The developers have divided their escape rooms into a handful of themed sets including an old mansion, a corporate office building, an Egyptian tomb, and even a space station. Each of these has a number of individual rooms that loosely tell a progressive story. The puzzles within do give you a good bit of challenge while still being readily solvable with all the materials they give you, though also having a system to dispense hints should you need them.There's also *some* amount of replayability to be had with each room having eight bonus tokens hidden quite stealthily within, in addition to the puzzles for escaping the room. I still have only found a handful after a good bit of time looking around while completing the rooms. Although, that and the awards given for completing the rooms within the time limit without hints haven't really kept my attention for the long haul.It does have both solo and cooperative play. I'd say the sweet spot there is two players at most personally. It seems like most rooms have just enough materials to keep the both of you busy on something. Having played in a group of three for most of the game, it personally felt like we often had situations where one player didn't have a heck of a lot to do because the other two were holding all the reference materials for the puzzles that could be actively worked on.	----->	13

This can be played as a light party game for some laughs or it can be played on a competitive level with some really interesting and creative play.If you need AAA graphics or feel like you should get hundreds of hours per dollar spent, this likely isnt for you,  but if you can appreciate solid mechanics and expert balancing in a truly unique asymmetrical 1v1, this is it!	----->	10

112882714	It's a great game! I mainly played co-op with a friend so that is my main perspective.It works well as a 2 player game, but there isn't a ton of synergy. It's more like we can each do our own thing and eventually we solve bits and pieces of a larger whole.Most of the Puzzles are excellent. They aren't too challenging nor too easy. The difficulty ramp isn't steep, but there is an increase as you progress through the game. The puzzles are also extremely creative. There are 25 main puzzles (Levels) that are divided into (5) themed based sections. If you're an average speed the levels should take 10-15 minutes.There is probably some hidden lore to all of the puzzles, but it's not essential to know. I haven't completed it yet so I don't know whether or not there is some sort of ending. If there is great, if not it's fine.I will say that my playthrough of the game has been a bit glitchy at times. It's not horrendous, but it does create a minor annoyance from time to time. The mobility in this game is also lacking, but that's not a vital part to a puzzle game. The physics engine for the game is also rough. It creates some dumb moments, but again not essential to the fun.Overall I definitely recommend this game if you're into puzzle based games. It was super fun. As a bonus once you've finished the main levels you can build your own, or play community levels. The amount of puzzles are endless!	----->	9

112920231	My wife and I have been playing this game in co-op after putting putting our kids to sleep. Absolutely fun game that is everything you would expect from an escape room simulator. Only two suggestions:- No way to point that I could find. I'd like to be able to have a line drawn from my character to the object I am pointing at visible to the co-op partners. This would make verbal communication a lot less tiring.- Graphics could be better. Yes I realize this is not a big budget title, but in the future if they have success they should really work on ramping up the graphics and be less cartoony.9/10	----->	8
112927965	Excellent game. There's still more development to do but the concept and what they have already made is great.	----->	0
112929687	Really lovely looking game with immersive sounds and honestly just watching the peeps running around living their best lives is a blast.  Easy game to get going and fun to get all the bldg types out there as fast as possible - lol - limited only by immigration speed and resource extraction!  My only 2 tiny complaints are (1) that there is nothing to show sphere of influence for a market after you've built it so it's hard to tell when/where to build another (hint just build them all over) and (2) if I've been away from the game for awhile I forget what the building types look like and when I try to see how close the granaries or warehouses are to the next area I want to build in I have to do a literal inventory of which buildings are where - it would be a nice feature if you could either have them highlight by type in the town and/or click through them like you can do with bldgs under construction.  Very enjoyable game!	----->	20

112978486	A fun City Builder with lots of customization options.Caught Jacob and Julia playing this on the Secret Sleepover Society and knew it would be right up my alley. Complex enough that it remains challenging throughout the game, yet simple enough that I don't feel incapable when something happens. My favorite part of the game is the way you can customize the placement, name and decorations on almost every building. The only thing I'd like to see change would be an option to move buildings instead of just manually destroying and rebuilding them, and some more control over where citizens build their housing. But neither of these detract from my enjoyment of the game. Conflict is minimal and optional, so if you'd rather your citizens live peaceful lives unadulterated from warring factions of this or that, then you don't have to. 9/10 would absolutely recommend.	----->	5
112982558	Fantastic game. Worth it for the replay value from user-created levels alone.Do you like puzzle games? Do you like point and click adventure games? Have you ever wanted to play one with your friends? Get this ASAP. It's a steal at its price.	----->	4

113047748	I absolutely love it I thought at first that you could only play the 3 rooms but you can play others as well which is super cool! It's super cheap for how good this game is and I love it cause its affordable for most. Definitely recommend for other people I really do enjoy it!	----->	19
113050462	Really feels almost similar to doing an escape room in real life, only complaint is that like a real escape room, you can only experience the rooms once. The game has 5 official maps (4 with 5 stages, 1 with just 1 level) and they are all very solid, each room in a map recommend has a 10-15 minutes timer so you have an hour to beat the whole map roughly. You won't fail if you run out the timer, you will just not be able get the trophy for the stage. The puzzles are just about right, some not too hard not too easy either, there are some rough spikes for someone with my intellect but eventually I figured them out. But thats not all though! When you beat the maps... community maps! You can download workshop maps created by other players. This is something I'm kind of worried about because I hope the devs don't just leave the maps to the players and hope they release some maps since the dev maps are naturally of higher quality but the community maps are pretty solid too.	----->	5

113120128	Very polished and smooth experience! I just wish there was a toggle/command to see what items the other players pinned on their screen. There is a great variety of puzzles and none of the puzzles have been unfair so far.Edit : The game started lagging after two hours for some reason, me and my friend refunded this, which is unfortunate cause the game is great. Luckily, this does not seem to be a wide spread issue so I still recommend this game to others.	----->	2

113163749	This is a phenomenal escape room game. The rooms are fantastic and well done. My favorite part are the user made rooms though!

113200817	Definitely the best executed escape room type game that gets closest to the feel of actual escape rooms. Coop actually works good most of the time. Good quality of life features make this game stand out like being able to look at items at the same time as other players, pinning an item to your screen, and zooming in for interacting with smaller things. Haven't played all the dev levels but they're pretty well designed too with some good atmosphere as well. Love the character customizer as well but would love to see more clothes and hairstyles in the future. Community level editor and workshop is definitely gonna keep this game alive and would recommend for that feature alone.Some gripes. Community levels in coop are sometimes janky loading in with larger parties >3. The default camera can induce motion sickness but they have settings to alleviate this. Would be nice to have adjustable sprint speed since some of the community levels can be quite large and it's a bit of a slog to walk around.Overall, this is a cool game I can see coming back to over years. Definitely would recommend with friends for a more fun/chaotic experience. Solo is fun as well but think this game shines in coop.	----->	26

113309189	So much fun! This game reminds me of Age of Empires, minus the pressure of being attacked by enemies as soon as you've established your civilisation.

113311432	I know that people are stupid in real life, but it shouldn't translate so accurately into a game. designating a large area as residential, only to have a house be built smack in the middle on an awful angle and not leave room for more houses; They manage to make the most inconvenient path to take a shortcut; Shortages when there shouldn't be, simply because they just wont fill their own basic needs; Please add an intelligence upgrade.	----->	-8
113311963	This game is a lot of fun if you want to get the escape room experience without having to go to an actual escape room. You play at your own pace or try and beat the timer. Some of the puzzles are very complex (imo) and if I didn't have my friend playing with me (or used the hint button) I wouldn't have been able to beat some of the levels. There is replayability with plenty of user-created rooms. I would definitely recommend this for people that like escape rooms/puzzles/want an activity to do with friends online. I don't suggest playing with more than 3 people total because some of the rooms are very small and too many avatars would make it hard to find things.	----->	5

113341109	If you like escape rooms and puzzles in real life or in a virtual world, this game is for you. If the price is right, just grab it.Why is it worth your time? The base game has several themes - each with 5 rooms. These are all well done and also include secrets to go back and find after you've solved them once.But it's the room editor that makes this game so great. Theoretically, endless numbers of rooms can be created by other users and shared so they just keep coming! I've completed the base game - although I haven't found all the secrets yet - but I keep finding new rooms to play in the workshop. And there's a nice workshop browser included in the game so you don't have to leave the game to find a new room. They've also got sections for top rooms. I haven't tried to create a room myself, but I'm definitely looking forward to that eventually.The game also has multiplayer, but I haven't tried that yet myself. I've shared my screen over Discord and found that works well, but the true multiplayer experience is probably a closer version of an actual escape room. I imagine it's lots of fun, but since I haven't tried it, I can't say for certain.Imperfect things: Occasionally I've run into a bug or two - usually in a workshop room - but the game is very stable in my experience. The graphics are generally bright and on the simple/cartoony side so if you require grit and photo realism, you won't find it in this game. The audio is fine and the controls are reasonable, but it takes a while to get use to some of them. (Even though I play the game a couple times each week, I still forget how to do some things from time to time.)Overall, I'd say this is probably one of the best games I've played in terms of value for the money so I'd definitely recommend it if you're at all interested.	----->	20

113366916	I would recommend to other players but wish that the solutions were randomized.After playing the demo, I really enjoyed going through the rest of the rooms. It is great for a blind playthrough, but because the solutions aren't randomized the rooms aren't worth replaying unless looking for the tokens you missed. I liked that there is a hint button but some of the hints aren't helpful as I know what I'm supposed to do but am missing a vital piece of information. I like the background music and some solutions being hidden in plain sight. As a chemistry major and teacher, I approve of the chemistry puzzle room. I also like that there are community rooms like in Portal 2 to try.	----->	18

113369657	Ever wanted to know what it's like to be addicted to drugs with out being addicted to drugs? Well do I have a game for you!This game might as well be digital crack. It's currently 4am. I started around 10pm and that was just tonight. Time simply melts away as you build your way to the ultimate medieval paradise. A mix of mechanics/themes from Banished and City Skylines fuse together into one of the most addicting games I've played in years. New updates are still coming out and the devs are active on their community page. For 24 bucks on midweek madness sale (normally 29.99) this game is the cheapest i've ever been able to find drugs that never disappear no matter how many times you use them. So grab your spoon and shoot this masterpiece straight into your veins! All jokes aside 10/10 would recommend.	----->	5
113378738	This game is perfect for 2 people! It's great for virtual date nights or just to play something that's oddly relaxing with someone else. The puzzles aren't frustrating either, we haven't had to use a guide to solve them; we've only used them to find the tokens hidden in the levels.It also has a feature to reduce motion sickness. I can't tell what it does but it's neat that it's there!	----->	5

113399012	Well crafted levels, and a level editor for infinite puzzle content. Fun time waster if you're really in the mood for problem solving, the puzzles aren't overly complicated but you might get stuck here or there and that's what the hints are for	----->	-4

113418773	Отличная игра, сочетающая в себе рогалик и головоломку. С рогаликом всё понятно, а головоломка заключается в том, что подземелья разбиты на равные участки (клетки 7х7), и вы можете встать на каждый из них только один раз. Более того, за вами тянется поводок, который не может пересекаться (как в змейке). Таким образом, ваш путь извилист и уникален, вследствие чего нужно продумывать каждый ход.Играете же вы за весёлого пса, который хочет спасти свою хозяйку, бабушку-божий одуванчик. В каждом подземелье ему надо проложить путь до выхода. Мешать ему это сделать будут не только ловушки, но и разнообразные монстры, расставленные по клеткам. Вставая на место монстра, вы его уничтожаете, но теряете одно сердечко. Восполнять вы их можете за счёт аптечек, до которых ещё нужно добраться. Так и продумываете ходы, рассчитывая скольких вы монстров можете убить, чтобы добраться до ближайшей аптечки и выбраться из подземелья. Если сердечек не осталось, и вы два раза столкнулись с врагом, вас начинает преследовать призрак, идущий вслед за вами, по поводку. Как только он вас настигнет, начнёте уровень сначала. Враги же интересны тем, что к каждому из них нужен свой подход. К одним нужно заходить сзади, к другим можно подойти только уничтожив несколько монстров подряд, что послабее, и далее в таком же духе. Монстров много и вариаций их истребления не меньше.Самое интересное, что вы всегда можете сделать ход назад, неограниченное количество раз. Хоть до самого входа в подземелье можете вернуться. Это оказуаливает игру, но не отменяет того, что нужно продумывать дальнейший ход. Просто прощупывать путь можно не в голове, а на практике. Есть и другие элементы, упрощающие геймплей. Например, поменять местами вход и выход, если вдруг посчитали, что с другой стороны вам удобнее просчитать путь. Или что вы скажете на то, что выйдя с игры, а потом зайдя в неё вы приятно удивитесь, обнаружив вашего пса на той же самой позиции, на которой он и оставался стоять. Игра всеми фибрами души дружелюбна к игроку. Учитывая эти факторы, можно сказать, что игра очень хорошо подходит как таймкиллер. Но не всё так радужно. В игре есть бонусные уровни, ставящие ряд условий для прохождения. Например, вас сразу преследует призрак , что подгоняет вас и не даёт времени для долгих раздумий. Вот с ними показуалить уже не получится:-)В общем, игра хорошая, с красивым пиксельным визуалом, отличной музыкой и интересным геймплеем. Правда ценник высоковат за такую игру. Но по скидке можно и приобрести. Плохой игру точно не назовёшь.	----->	0

113424767	Very well made, especially for an Early Acces game, well done so far![hr][/hr][h2]The good[/h2]- Incredible beautiful art, graphics and music!- Very easy user interface- Clever combination of traditional building placement and zoning (from SimCity-like games)- The ability to customize key structures such as churches or the lords manor, I hope to see more of this!- Roads/paths are created by the AI automatically, but you can restrict it by using the deny-zone. It really makes the town look more natural and less 'by design'.- Sending out armies to distant lands (offscreen) is a very nice change of pace, instead of having to fight it out on your soil like in other games. I love this mechanic, very well made!- Slow pace, easy to learn, the perfect game to relax with.[hr][/hr][h2]What I hope to see added[/h2]- A map generator would really bring this game to the next level- More sea-focussed buildings, including perhaps tradeships that visits the town similar to the current trader[hr][/hr][h2]The bad[/h2][i]It is early access, what is lised as 'bad' might be on the roadmap already[/i]- The border of the maps need attention, so one does not luck 'under' the map when moving the camera- The water could use attention, especially in the maps Coastal and Mountain.....that is it, trivial things, it is a really good game!	----->	26

113475478	Honestly didn't expect to get much out of this game. It turned into a real great way to game with my friend and get lost solving puzzles. The base content provided is a great toe dip into the rooms and puzzles this experience provides, however I think it's brought to life with it's Community Workshop and all the fantastic creations folks have made. Sure you get some not so great ones, but the fun doesn't get stale. I would recommend this game 100000% over at this price point. It's a lot of fun, the controls are ridiculously simple and getting into a game with a friend is stupidly easy (as it should be) Definitely pick up this game	----->	16

113521726	simple but fun When there are more maps and more in depth progression then this could have incredible replay potential.perhaps maybe have more in depth battle system or something more involved with the military side of things maybe have traits for villagers for example a villager may excel at being a miner but be terrible at foraging just some small ideas that could change how we play the game also adds a slight element of character to the villagers	----->	0
113526903	Honestly one of my favorite games and I completely loose my sense of time every time i play. I'll play it all night sometimes. Great game! It still has a bit of missing content and is slowly being worked on and upgraded. One thing as a person who has owned this game for a couple years is that there is no priest. Like it even has a section for it but there are no priests. That's just always annoyed me, but that's such a minor complaint. It would be nice if that when you finished unlocking everything that people wouldn't keep coming to your town and offering you tasks for the king and stuff when you have no reason to do so. Also It would be really nice if they fleshed out more towns to trade with since you can't trade around every item and you unlock each of the trading routes pretty quickly Get ready for your pc to be tested in the late game. It absolutely will chug but there have been updates that have significantly improved proformance and I must give them credit for that. I'm sure it's a technical nightmare to get it all running incredibly smoothly.Processor AMD Ryzen 5 3600Installed RAM	24 GBGraphics card Gtx 1660 super	----->	4
113530909	fabulous! polished! beautiful! interesting! tons of q.o.l. features (like RESIZABLE FONT (YAY!) and wall and fence dragging, or how amazingly flexible the building system is; all the parts can be moved to your liking and they follow the terrain nicely).

Very clever game (even some collectibles are very cleverly hidden). Best enjoyed in co-op but either way you won't regret it, even though there are some minor bugs here and there I haven't encountered any that take you out of the experience. All in all a very good buy and a MUST buy for puzzle lovers out there.	----->	9

113546442	This game can run throughout the whole day with little to no intervention from the player and the city just lives its own happy and peaceful life. It is an absolute joy to build a village, a town and a city to your liking with no immense pressure and it just does not get boring. I love every hour that passes by in this game and I dont care if I am out of my home doing groceries or staring at my screen. I love hard work, I can watch it for hours.

113556588	I really enjoy strategic sims, things like this, Humankind, Littlewood, Kynseed, you know, casual/relaxed city building or resource management kinds of games. I picked this up while it was on sale and really look forward to how it grows until it fully releases. I haven't even tried mods yet because I'm admittedly lazy and not computer smart, but have been really enjoying getting used to managing supplies, though it can feel a little confusing at times. I think I hit the max for a few supplies as I could no longer assign workers for some productions, but I think it's a mix of still being in progress and my lack of gaming skills LOL.TL;DR it's a really nice game so far, I'm eager to try modding and more playthroughs, and it's definitely satisfying.	----->	7
113566029	A feel good game designed to make you feel smart for solving children's puzzles. I am currently thoroughly enjoying my play through. This speaks to my desire of wanting to feel intelligent. Couldn't recommend more if you have a superiority complex like myself.	----->	12

113651172	I've been waiting to buy this game for a while now, watching people play on YouTube. I'm so excited to get to play now. I literally sat and played for nearly 5 hours straight. It's genuinely so fun, while also being relaxing and peaceful. I'm really enjoying this game and am excited to see what the devs have in store for us.	----->	8
113652062	Its a highly enjoyable game, me and my friends have lots of fun with it although its not fun playing singleplayer. Its just the right amount of easy and frustrating, and very satisfying when we are able to escape.	----->	9

113698897	This game, at its base, its decent. But community rooms (and tools provided!) is where it really shines, as the community created rooms are often incredibly fun and creative! Sheer number of rooms is something, which can entertain you for many, many hours.Also, bring a friend with you!	----->	4
113706838	if you like escape rooms, this is def worth a pick up even at full price.the community rooms had alot of additional playability especially with a friend.Could use some improvement on sorting what sort of rooms are designed for solo or coop Hopefully they will continue to incentivize community rooms and expand the asset base for which most of the rooms are being built with.	----->	8

113711447	I enjoy this game with my brother on occasion - but I do not recommend this game at the price tag of $25.  This is a $10 or $5 game at best.	----->	4
113714928	Good Game Okay physics And not really realistic But fun with friends who are at the same level of playing as you.	----->	4
113727369	Is this game more fun with friends? Probably yes.But on the other hand, it's been a long time I've had this much fun in terms of relaxing and just solving puzzles that challenge you but are by no means impossible to solve without a walkthrough guide (which the devs have built in-game just in case).I recommend this. If you're wondering if this game is good when played solo, then my answer would be absolutely yes. The campaign is fun and with the addition of community maps, this game will keep you busy for a long time.	----->	17

113764633	The kind of game i keep coming back to. Some workshop creations are very well done, mad props to all players who create cool stuff. Would be nice if they were provided with more tools as the possibilities are somewhat limited. Hope the devs come up with new maps as the available ones are pretty short. I recommend these workshop rooms: Clockwork Inc - best one I've played through, Three-Palm Island, Deluxe Museum Heist, Wincrest Manor, Riddles Books and a Lab, Haunted Mansion, Color Wheel	----->	9

113767745	I love how the game developers implemented customizing buildings in this game, way more fun than any other city builder I have played. It speaks to me creative desires to build. I have started struggling after getting my city to over 150 people with keeping everyone happy and balanced. I am getting frustrated with a warehouse full of cloth right next to my tailor shop but the tailor shop won't produce clothes for lack of cloth. This game might be getting a little too much micromanaging than I prefer, I want a game to feel like play not work. But the level of customization I can create with my city will keep me coming back for another try.	----->	9

113879640	Its fun with a friend. The puzzles arent contextually logical, but are logical themselves. By that i mean, the rooms are setup with loosely interconnecting puzzles, but often dont make sense in terms of the room context. Mostly its gamey mechanics and puzzles, which can sometimes be quite difficult, but not all that interesting. Boils down to literal numeric codes to find and enter; a sequence of actions to perform in an order; arranging items in a correct order.The puzzles just exist in the room as means for something to do, not that there is some thought out context for why the room is the way it is. So items would be placed illogically in places, if you think about how the room would be naturally setup. Like a broken fuel cell that you have to repair on a broken space ship, but all it needs is a battery item, which happens to be locked in a safe, so you need to find a code. Why? Because you're not supposed to think about it, just do the puzzles in order. Context is irrelevant.	----->	2

114038908	Great little city builder/colony sim.  Compared to others, I found it unique in that your villagers do all the work as far as placing homes and making roads so your towns grow more organically.  You just sort of zone in where you want things, handle placement of important structures, and deal with micro managing inventory.  Love the visuals, sounds, and overall aesthetic.  The few complaints I have really just the builders get into some wonky behavior the further you spread out your towns, walls are annoying, and it just needs more content.  Luckily it supports modding though so that is always an option.	----->	5

114047239	Like doing an escape room on a computer. The levels are good though expect to be able to solo a room in anywhere from 10 to 30 mins in general.  The real gem i this game is the community rooms which are plentiful and very creative. That coupled with co-op play makes this a great game for anyone who loves puzzles and escape rooms and wants to be able to do them solo, as well as playing with others. Certainly worth the cost of the game.	----->	6

114103673	Such an awesome game! The easiest way to play escape rooms without going anywhere. I like that the game has become a platform now and there is a TON of quality content in the workshop, some of it surpassing the first-party content itself! Pine Studio seems to be doing a great job in growing their creator community. All I need for it to be complete, is VR support. VRChat has a similar user-created platform, but the problem lies in finding good puzzle worlds. A platform dedicated to the puzzle solving escape room loving community solves that problem nicely. I hope some day VR support can be a reality for this game to bring truly immersive remote escape rooms into reality.	----->	16

114609714	Foundation is according to me a game that you can play over and over again if you're bored. When you're done with your first world you can always make another with mods and try it that way instead.It's almost a perfect game however it still lacks a little. After a certain point you're unable to progress with anything new, I personally would love some kind of aging system where you unlock more stuff by evolving and researching. Foundation is a early acces game and I'm really hoping that they add more buildings and a variety in buildings later on. More masterpieces would be nice too. But in the end Foundation is still worth buying even though it might lack a little it has great potential and is already a great game.	----->	26

114619230	The base game is a lot of fun, but the real magic here is the community of people making new rooms that you can download and play for free.

If you have enjoyed other escape room PC games, this one is well worth checking out.	----->	1

114636277	If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pieDirections:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.	----->	11
114637180	Enjoyed my time with it; best organic looking city builder I've played so far. However, the late-game production lines trip me up.Maybe I'm just a beginner, but I found the resource tracking and production line incredibly frustrating. For example, I had fully stocked fish but I was showing Food Shortage from my citizens because I needed to empty the Granary manually (?) But my fishing hut also had full fish, but wasn't distributing it to the marketplace, warehouse, or citizens? It seemed very counter-intuitive. Also I'm not sure if I like how technology progresses in the game currently (Raising people to citizens and gaining reputation etc.). Would be interesting if they just did a normal tech tree.I'm hoping they do look at how all of this works eventually as I'm seeing a lot of potential for this game (UNIQUELY DESIGNED BUILDINGS, MODULAR Additions to major buildings), but for now it was a fairly enjoyable 8 hours (until it wasn't).	----->	10

114740037	REALLY great game! I enjoy playing all the time! I can tell this game will only keep growing, and will rise even further in popularity. If you like city-building games, this may be what you are looking for. My only complaint is that the villagers sometimes have difficulty deciding where to live, especially when they are transporters or market-tenders. This eventually drags the happiness of the entire village down, and forces me to give up. I try really hard to give them space to live, but they simply refuse to settle down. If they don't want to build a house, that shouldn't be my problem. Otherwise, its a great game and I 100 percent recommend it.	----->	12

I shouldn't have to do extreme micromanagement of resources coming from one end of town to get it to the other. Just teleport the damn stuff.. literally wait weeks for fish or the like to get from lakeside storage or have villagers taking freetime and ignoring 100's of wheat in one area and not getting it to another. Entire road blocks of production based around this issue that lead to people mad and hungry with literally mountains of food in some locations not being distributed with dozens of transporters picking their noses and hanging in the town square.	----->	0

114892742	Fun game for fans of escape rooms and solving puzzles! However, would not recommend playing with more than 2 players. There simply isnt enough to keep each person occupied in each room.  A third player could be viable, to assist and think things through. Devs did a good job in making it easy for players to interact with the same object. Overall, well polished and an enjoyable. 10/10 recommend for those with friends and family who also enjoy this genre.	----->	10

115080050	Just like the title implies, it’s a coop digital escape room. The digital nature lets them stray away from the traditional puzzles to more fun and outlandish stuff which I did. The level of challenge is good but sometimes you’re just looking for a particular hole to put your key in and you don’t spot and get frustrated. The coop is awesome and it’s great to solve puzzles with friends. Most of them have at least two strands of logic you can go through at the same time so someone isn’t stuc. However, the rooms are small, the controls are kinda bad, and the lack of a shared inventory means a lot of fumbling around and less solving puzzles. The community seems to be supporting the game with new campaigns and it is fun.	----->	16

115163611	I really enjoyed that - just the right combination of head-scratching required, without it becoming frustrating.Ideal to just dip into for 20 mins and get absorbed. I wasn't a massive fan of the earlier levels, but they seem to get progressively better as the game goes on.	----->	5
115165604	Really well made and scratches that Escape Room itch! The built-in levels are really creative and the sub levels give you 15 minutes to solve it. The only penalty if you don't finish in time is that you don't get the achievement so you can still keep trying to solve it, which is really nice. The only nitpick I have is that with the levels we played (Egyptian, Space) get pretty claustrophobic when there's 4 players but it does say 2-3 is ideal if multiplayer. It's a great game to play with friends and the community levels give it a lot of replayability! Highly recommend for puzzle minded players!	----->	8

115178864	Escape room on PC without the need of leaving your home. You can play solo or co-op online up to 10 players. Some rooms require more players to solve but there's plenty for those who want to solve solo. Each room has a theme and multiple levels as you progress. No need to search the web, everything is given to and you just have to put the two together. Create and share your own escape room. The creators have built an working workshop with all the tools you need. Once you've finished and published it to the world online, and try other players creations. We as group had quite the time from other creators. A couple buggy maps but it didn't ruined our experience. We had an absolute blast and will be back.	----->	1

115424859	Yes. and not really. Couldn't play this game more than 20 minute due to the motion sickness. Even after i did the adjustment in the setting. Still feel so bad.Yet recommend this as the puzzle is quite challenging.	----->	2
115427271	Everything about it is great. The community maps are good, the base game maps are good, the controls are good, the graphics are good. It’s all good. If you like Puzzles then you’ll get far more than the asking price out of it.	----->	2

115431872	This game is awesome!I played in off-line mode most of the time, so in time than I'm writing rewiev its only 11 hours, but I already spent more than 60h in playing!Very interesting game about medieval, you should think in forward about logistick in your village otherwise you will have huge problems with delivering and many other small on the first view things which will influense on happines of your village. Game all the time get updates with new interesting mechanics!Game contents from other users(mods) also possible to upload.One of the best city builders with economics :)	----->	6

115476973	I find this game very zen.You know that day, where you're just drained, and you don't want to worry about winning or losing? Don't want to follow the story? Don't want to stress about the outcomes of your choices?Foundation is the game I boot up when I'm just burnt out on everything. The little villagers build their lives and I can't mess it up all too bad. I'm either growing the town or stagnating and nothing is stuck forever.This game fits in a very particular space for me but it fills that space beautifully. My zen sand garden of a game.	----->	1

115498957	What a great way to relax and just build. I love how dynamic the environment is and all of the little details that have been thought of so far. The roads are made when regularly traveled and the grass regrows if it's no longer needed as you build out your settlement. The reforestation and choices of trees to reforest is also awesome. Painting the zone areas and allowing for layering is really useful. For instance you can layer extraction for wood cutting and reforestation. So you can keep your forests as a renewable resource and choose the trees you want your forester to plant. The entire experience is very organic, and relaxing. The game runs smoothly on max settings and the close all windows button is a nice feature to keep yourself from getting overwhelmed with all of the management windows. For those used to builders like this the learning curve is not bad at all. Keep up the good work Devs. Solid and aesthetically pleasing platform!	----->	10

115505922	I would definitely recommend this to my friends. I love escape games and they have a lot of different escape episodes. I had fun and is still having fun with my friends. I haven't been able to get all the episodes but I will. the most difficult one for me and my friends is the sudoku escape. Unless you are a master at that game, and really understand the rules for it, you cannot pass. I'm still stuck in it. T-T	----->	8

115511836	I enjoy the more organic feel of the towns and resource gathering vs lots of others I've played. Visually looks nice and it's fun building things. A bit laid back for me personally but I'll say it's a well put together game.	----->	9

115517729	What an incredible City Builder! It's complexity is less frustrating than some of the other games of the genre but with enough depth to remain intriguing. It has the fluid feeling that Roller Coaster Tycoon has, such that if you make sure the necessary services are in abundance, the villager's AI figures it out. This fluidity is such a great feature in contrast to staring at and re-making a troublesome intersection (Lookin at you Cities: Skyline) for little to no improvement.Definitely worth the purchase on sale!	----->	3

115518995	nice game	----->	3
115522927	The rewind ability is a nice touch to make it less punishing in the short-term. Although I feel it was more of something that was implimented to get around the poor procedural generation. There were several levels that didn't seem solveable without gold, which to me seems a needlessly high bar and more of something you'd put behind an achievement (ex: finish x levels without using gold). Overall, if I could give it a meh I'd give it a meh, so in lieu of that I have to give it a no. There are other games that distill the individual elements of this game much better than this game does a job of merging them into a seemlessly enjoyable experience. It was okay.	----->	5

115566609	Absolutely LOVING this game right now. It is obviously still in early access, and therefore still needs development. But it's fun, relaxing, enjoyable, and beautiful. The base game is not particularly challenging once you get a handle on how the game functions, but there are mods that can make the game far more challenging. Which brings me to another amazing plus for this game, it's in early access and has an amazing modding community. All in all, 10/10 recommend, and I'm looking forward to some more balance passes and more new content!	----->	8

115599834	The devs are awesome.  The game allows you to make your own escape rooms with a pretty good editor (which is continuously updated).  The launch rooms were a bit simple, but both official and community rooms since have kept the game fresh and fun.  The fact there's also multiplayer so you can make and run stuff with a friend is great as well.  If you like logic puzzles alone or with friends, this is great value, and the upcoming 2022 updates (LUA scripting and model importing) will only make it better.	----->	10

115627913	great city builder. There's a few things I wish were different, but overall, it's a great little game. Reminds me a little of Catan. I really like how the roads are made by just walking on them over and over. The level of creativity one can express in building is immensely satisfying (for a city builder that is) and the joy of discovering a new game and it's many wonders does not fall short with Foundation. If you even remotely liked sim city, methinks you will love this game.	----->	17

The puzzles are clever and the rooms are just really fun. There are some quirks with the interface but in general it's a tough thing to move an inherently physical experience into the virtual space. If you enjoy escape rooms, you will 100% enjoy this.	----->	5

115778058	I really do enjoy this game. It is super fun. However, I wish there were more official maps. You can go through the game pretty quickly and are just left with the workshops. While the workshop has some cool maps, it often gets really buggy and I hate that some maps aren't multiplayer. I was excited when I saw the steampunk update, but then I realized it was a DLC... Will the DLC be free or will we have to buy it? I just feel like the game in general needs more content included into the base game, more official rooms.	----->	11

115842730	I mostly spend time making rooms and playing community levels. It is fun making and playing them. Just a few problems:1. Some objects in the editor are set to pickable when it would not make sense. e.g: Pillars are set to pickable by default which is not very convenient.2. There is no jumping, having jumping would have so many opportunities for rooms. And to ensure no old rooms get messed up by it, make it toggleable and set all old room to no jumping and all new rooms to jumping by default.3. Have it so you can turn off the ceiling lights. Them being set on all the time sometimes ruins certain things.4. This one is more of a suggestion. Have bobbing for walking and running. It makes it look better.	----->	1

The value is insane.	----->	5

116244622	This game is extremely fun, especially with a group of people to play with, and the price is more than fair. $30 USD wouldn't be unreasonable for this game, in my opinion. The base game has around 5-15 hours of game play, depending on how quickly you figure out some of the puzzles and whether or not you use guides. Replayability isn't super high, but can still be fun if you're with a new person / group of people and let them do most of the problem solving. The game really shines with community content, as there is high workshop support including monthly spotlights of the most popular rooms made and semi-regular contests. As of this writing the DLC isn't out yet, but $5 USD for it again is very reasonably priced and is definitely something I'm looking forward to. 10/10, highly recommend this game. Very relaxing, the community rooms are often as good or better than the base game, and even when not are often hilarious. Great to play with a partner or friends and just relax.	----->	17

It is an amazing experience and somehow it's a minigolf mod.	----->	5

Get a couple of friends in on the fun and you will spend way more time than you care to admit playing a mini golf game. The biggest downside is the loot/reward system. I still have yet to get a skin or a legendary item of ANY kind! I'm really hoping they fix this in an update. If they do, 10/10	----->	3

116332150	If it seems like it'll be your thing, boy will it be your thing. An infinitely replayable and deep 1v1 game of strategy, bluff, memory, deception and skill where the experience of playing versus an opponent is an ever shifting and evolving meta beyond any RTS or strategy game I've played, based on trying to outwit your opponent and stay ahead and subvert their expectations of you. There's literally nothing quite like it. I find some of the negative reviews this game gets to be unfair, or at least misleading, and will attempt to explain why I feel this way. Though its clear that for this game to be 'for you' may have a few criteria, mainly that you're either interested in diving into the discord community and competitive scene, or you're willing to gift it to a friend or convince them to buy, and you're confident you'll have plenty of opportunities to play with them.Common negative reviews and comments on forums are: 1) its too expensive. The developers say this is specifically to discourage too large an influx of players until they feel its ready. I'm sceptical this is needed personally, but regardless, this is a game that, if its for you and you have someone to play with, could easily net you thousands of hours of fun. For hours per dollar that ain't half bad. The value estimation of this game often gets attributed to the amount of 'content' or how 'simple' the premise is, which doesn't really tell the whole story with the game's potential, since its depth and amount of content comes as much from your opponent as it does the mechanics or maps.2) No updates in a long while. I've heard covid has hampered development, and it has been a long while since the last update, however its clear from their discord the devs are still active and invested in the game. But regardless, as much as I'd like to see more content, its like bemoaning chess doesn't have enough content, enough differently designed boards, new pieces and new mechanics. What they have already is a pretty much infinitely playable competitive game that's as complicated and has enough content that it needs to. It is in my view far and above enough content for you and a friend to play for many years to come, both improving and learning each others game, the skill ceiling is in the stratosphere and in some respects having too much new content would risk breaking the competitive perfection of design.Like adding a new chess piece into the game of chess, more content in terms of mechanics is not necessarily a good thing, and certainly not a deal breaker. That's not to say new maps wouldn't be great, but there's a good sized collection already I can't imagine myself tiring of, and in some ways appreciate that my improving at the game can be focused to a non intimidating but solid collection of maps. There may be bugs here and there but the game seems well balanced and solid enough in terms of polish for the most part.It's also an experience you literally can't get anywhere else, and paying a bit of a  premium for something so utterly unique is ok by me.3) Low player count. This could potentially be a problem, if you don't have at least one friend to play with and you'd both be willing to commit to playing it regularly. There's a pretty cool, friendly, inviting and vibrant discord community and competitive scene, so there are ways to easily find games, but just logging into the lobby is probably going to leave you waiting to get into matches a bit too often. If you have a friend to play with, however, this could be something you both continue to play and enjoy for a decade and there'll likely never come a point where you think you've gotten as good as you can be, and will be a constant neverending shift in the meta as you both try and work against your opponent's knowledge of your strategies and habits to try and get the upper hand. Even with a set amount of mechanics or maps, the landscape of your games against each other will change constantly and you'll never be in a rut otherwise you'll be losing.If you have someone to play with, and are not relying on randoms on the internet to play -- or are interested into getting into the competitive scene, then this game is a rich enough 1v1 PVP experience with such a great amount of strategy and skill to develop to keep you invested in playing matches for many years. In my case, I'm limited by my friend's availability to play, and am not really interested in competitive or random online play for fear of widening our skill gap too much, otherwise I imagine I'd have a play time in the many many hundreds at least, if not thousands. I can't imagine myself ever of having my fill.Also, once you know the game well enough from playing yourself, then the competitive scene provides endless entertainment as its an extremely watchable game. I'm not a sports fan, and don't really watch competitive gaming at all, however for the first time I found such a thrill watching casters commentate pro-level games, its pretty enthralling to watch as well as informative.	----->	51

116591877	This game is great. A great experience on PC so I can only imagine how immersive it is on VR. This is a strange compliment but a lot of the details are really realistic seen up close, especially on the egyptian level. The game title is terrible but the gameplay is rich. The only thing I'd make sure to change is the hint system. if someone is halfway through the level, and the game knows that, why give the first hint available? It makes a game of waiting around for the hints to progress to find the one that will help you.	----->	3

116671231	A fantastic little gem of a game that captures the creative thinking and puzzle-solving of escape rooms as elegantly as any virtual environment could hope to. At the same time, this game finds a way to push on just beyond what a real-life escape room could bring while showing restraint in not overdoing it. The price, I feel, is very fair for the game and official content, whilst there is a large community workshop available with more rooms to complete. Easy recommend for any who loves to puzzle!	----->	12
116677248	The base games are entertaining and interesting.  The best part is the additional rooms built by the community.  Some of these are as good as the base game rooms.  Do watch the ratings on community games - some can be glitchy.  Well worth the game price overall.	----->	10

116697066	While it's only a few hours of experience built-in, it's very engaging and inspiring. It makes me want to go to an escape room again. Full of clever puzzles and fun twists. Constantly putting in new ways to use and think about the controls, all the way up until the end.This isn't the hardest puzzle game, and I'm glad it's not. It's the perfect difficulty and the hint system is very forgiving. I also love the general vibe and atmosphere for all the various locations. Very relaxing and detailed. Highly recommended.	----->	15

116700955	Works great with both singleplayer and multiplayer! Lots of amazing community levels and the level editor isn't too hard to figure out with their tutorials and a couple of youtube videos! I seriously recommend this to anyone who likes escape rooms or wants to give them a go without having to spend $25+ per person for an IRL room (as much as I do love them as well).Looking forward to (hopefully) more DLC's in the future!	----->	12

116732363	Great main story rooms (and the newly released DLC is better than base game), but the main replayability is in the workshop content. Easy 8/10 overall, can be a bit buggy with collision in custom levels but overall really fun and worth the low price.	----->	6

116759946	This is a fine game to play with friends or unknowns. But playing with unknowns has some flaws, you can kick them if you host a game but you can not votekick with other players when the host is not managing a situation. Also I am a bit disappointed to see how part of the community became toxic (insults / taunts in chat ; kick from game because host is not gonna win).Those flaws aside, if you meet few nice people or you are with some friends, you create a private game where you invite them and you can have a lot of fun, there is, actually, a nice part of the community as well which created many customized maps funny to play.	----->	11

116775200	Very addicting game if you like solving riddles. The gameplay is intuitive and satisfying. There are a bunch of official levels, but also an infinite amount of workshop maps made by the community. Those obviously vary quite a lot by quality, but there are some really mindblowing levels out there. You can also easily create your own levels!If you have played We Were Here or similar co-op games, you will also like playing this. Most levels can be solved alone, but there are also some that require working together!	----->	6
116775290	best escape room game on Steam. Not too many official maps, but the quality of them is A+. Some workshop maps are actually VERY good and the ones that aren't that good will give you a good lauigh anyway.If you're looking for an escape room game, this is the one to get.	----->	10

116776108	Game is an absolute blast with 1 other person. I'd say anymore than 3 people makes these puzzles too easy. Overall, definitely recommend at whatever price. Worth it as the devs definitely put in a ton of effort creating these unique puzzles.	----->	2

116779046	The clues are vague and there is no plot but the puzzles themselves are very challenging and time consuming. Each should take 15 minutes but it takes me and my sibling at least 30 minutes to solve the entire puzzle, but thankfully that doesn't make this experience boring and it means I get the most for my buck. I wish I could change some of the controls because well time is running out you sometimes forget how to crouch. Overall 8/10 would recommend though mind how time consuming it is.	----->	-3

116797379	This is as good as any Escape Room. The main games puzzles are top notch and many of the community puzzles are fun to play this. I'm fortunate enough to have a friend who I can play this game with but it's just as fun playing solo. Both the main game and the DLC are worth the price. Can't wait for more rooms come out from the developers.	----->	17
116798324	Very soothing game. Im always calm when I play this game. I haven't destroyed any keyboards, or mouses, or nerves. I have never raised my voice when playing. My friends love this also. So Im rating this 10/10, would recommend.	----->	5

116807830	Game is fun alone or playing with friends, it's probably easier alone though cause otherwise items may be lost between the inventories. It does become pretty easy to figure out which items are needed and which ones are useless cause it tells you when you need it. Nonetheless would definitely recommend if you want a game to use your brain, it's probably the best escape game around.	----->	2

117005705	If you like escape rooms, I think you'll like this. Get it on sale, though.	----->	3
117007851	This is a good game concept.  However, this game has too little for it to be considered worth the purchase.  While I did have fun, I had to purchase a game for me and my friend had purchase it too in order to even play with each other.  If you aren't playing it with someone who you can talk to directly it doesn't feel worth the purchase.  The online feels super prehistoric even though the game is only online multiplayer.  If you're going to create a game that's only multiplayer, it's recommended that you have content and fun online.Some suggestions on how to improve the game is to add voice chat or a quick chat, add more maps, more tasks for the spy, an ability to remove hazards blocking the sniper's view, and more characters to the roster to keep it fresh.	----->	19

117055109	Key factsWorldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975.In 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight. Of these over 650 million were obese.39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016, and 13% were obese.Most of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight.39 million children under the age of 5 were overweight or obese in 2020.Over 340 million children and adolescents aged 5-19 were overweight or obese in 2016.Obesity is preventable.What are obesity and overweightOverweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health.Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults. It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2).AdultsFor adults, WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows:overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; andobesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30.BMI provides the most useful population-level measure of overweight and obesity as it is the same for both sexes and for all ages of adults. However, it should be considered a rough guide because it may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different individuals.	----->	-2

117088398	Quite a nice relaxing experience. There's something nostalgic about Foundation and I don't mean gamewise, but something akin to the childhood games you play with your toys kind of way. It's just a bliss to watch the little people toil away and watch as your village grows quite organically into town and city. Hard recommend if you're seeking something more relaxing to play that has still quite nice gameplay loop.	----->	13
117099555	pretty good, even better with friends.	----->	3

117107353	It's really fun to play co-op, and the puzzles are a good mix of fairly easy to time consuming to figure out. Easy enough to keep you interested but hard enough to be the right kind of challenge that doesn't frustrate you to no end.	----->	7
117109802	Really scratches an itch, and allows you to play escape rooms with friends who live farther than you would like. Loads of creative rooms in the community space. Controls feel intuitive.	----->	1
117111309	This game is fun! Creative puzzles, decent graphics, cool themes. The best escape room game available in the market.Movement can be quite sluggish. Fun to play in co-op. Adrenaline rush to finish the level within the time limit in first try. Limited amount of official maps. The new map is a DLC you have to pay for. I don't know if they'll ever make official maps for free from now on. Lots of fanmade levels that can be extremely buggy and outright confusing at times. For the current price point, I would say that it's worth it! This opinion might change if they continue to spew out paid DLCs in the future. I personally don't mind paying for the DLCs, but like many other reviews have already stated, I believe this game needs more content for the base game. ╮ (. ❛ ᴗ ❛.) ╭	----->	5

117200524	One of the greatest and most satisfying castle / town builders I've ever played. This type of game is my favorite genre - and Foundation is a home run. Stellar and fun graphics, satisfying progression, challenging but manageable learning curve. This game is great for anyone looking for a non-combat city builder. The art style, camera, unique / organic building a pathway design - combined with a flexible camera makes this game a beauty to look at! So satisfying to build a picturesque village for hours. 10/10!	----->	14

117223867	We have come full circle, from mobile escape-the-room games for iOS and Android, to physical, in-person escape rooms, to multiplayer, walk-around simulators for PC.I quite like this.  After having played it, and seeing the amount and diversity of the content you get, I would have paid easily double the asking price, and I didn't buy it on sale.  It's basically a computerized version of an in-person escape room, complete with opening drawers, taking things off the walls, and, of course, multiplayer.  It's executed astoundingly well -- you can pick up and examine objects, both in your inventory (which has unlimited capacity, item stacking, and a self-configuring hotbar) and in the world, to turn them around, interact with them etc.  If two or more people are interacting with the same object at the same time, you can see each other's mouse cursors.   Each room has a time limit, but since it's all virtual and no one has a schedule to keep, you can keep playing after the timer runs out, and the only difference is that when you eventually do complete the puzzle, you don't get the trophy icon for it.I've only played the Omegacorp line and part of the Edgewood Mansion line, but I've thoroughly enjoyed both.  Omegacorp feels like it was made specifically for me, especially with the vintage computer references near the end.My one gripe is that the rooms feel a bit claustrophobic, especially with the amount of objects in them and the avatar(s) of the person/people you're playing with (even though they don't have collision).  Also that I haven't figured out a way to customize my avatar yet (although there probably is one).	----->	4

117243591	As a fan of escape room games,  i think this is one of the best of this genre. The way i can interact with almost everything feel just like real life escape room. Beside official maps there are bunch of community rooms and u can even create your own escape room. The game has so much potential, hope there will be more updates in the future	----->	7
117243621	Escape Simulator is a great game, teasing and challenging me to solve puzzles. I am a huge fan of puzzles.	----->	8
117243818	It's just early Early Access but plays like a finished and well polished game.It's easy to understand and to be fair easy to master. It's great to see how the path aremade by the civilians walking to their workspace and homes. Cities are generated organic.It's a truely relaxing game with a fun gameplay. Your people are living their lives and the music fits to the style and playfull graphics. Also there are a bunch of mods and usermade maps for you to explore. Can't do anything wrongwith 30€ and it's often forsale for 5-10€. And that's nothing!	----->	13

There is the workshop, however, it's never going to be as solid as what the original devs can do. Overall, still happy with the game and it's by far the best out there at the moment in this genre.	----->	9

117337995	Game is fun . Having a blast playing with my sister . My only issue is we cant make wacky character with the character customization and the Hint is unreliable (FOR ME atleast) . For example , when you halfway or almost at the end of a level and stuck , the hints it give is from the early section of the level . welp doesnt really hurt if u wanna charge your brain up .	----->	0

117344907	Highly recommend this one!

117373824	Super love this game!  This was a surprise hit with my co-op gaming group after we picked it up during a sale.  We've had several 8+ hour escape sessions already and it's become a firm favourite.  We're all hooked!  Searching for tokens is a great feature as it extends the gameplay of each level - think this mechanic should be available in the community designed levels.  The official levels are well designed but we could do with more of them and more Steam achievements too :)  Love seeing the creativity in the puzzle design of the workshops levels and the sheer number available massively boosts the playing hours of the game.  We're surprised at how much this game has to give, which is lucky as we just can't get enough.	----->	10

117396490	I've waited until I logged 100 hours on this game before posting a review.It's a good take on the genre and a great casual game. Easy to pick up. Each game lasts a few minutes.At the core it is still a collectible card game, with some strategy on how you construct your deck based on the cards you have and then pilot the deck. Don't feel obligated to sign up for newsletters for gifts, you don't have to.Good game to play as a free game? Absolutely. If you like the gameplay and want to spend some cash to support the Devs, then I would recommend you read some guides on where to get the most bang for buck. Otherwise, it is perfectly good as a quick game in between daily life stuff or more serious games.	----->	20

117441146	Addictive, fun, relaxing and yet a challege. Can be modded or played as an original game. I have played this over and over with different starting lands and/ or with mods of various things added.

My 17 year old even loves to play. Cute game for anyone wishing to forget time.	----->	6

117444535	If you're a fan of escape rooms and puzzles, I cannot recommend this game any more highly. Not only are the base rooms great in their own regard, but the Workshop allows the community to craft their own rooms, which has led to so many awesome masterpieces being created, with some even diving into other game genres. All in all, a fantastic game, and definitely one of my new favorites.	----->	19

117725643	Even though the concept isn't very unique, but the implementation and execution far exceeds anything out there in the market today. Unlike most other games in the genre, this one actually makes you think logically and lets you reason with your own self to figure the things out. Another reason you should play this game is for it's Workshop maps. The creativity behind some of those maps is astounding and they are such a blast to play through. Really grateful to the developers for making this amazing game accessible to everyone and putting out the development kit to help us create our own maps.	----->	12

117728039	Great ! Buy this game without a doubt if you like playing escape rooms (you can do it with or without others).Strong puzzles, everything works as it should, and I'm eagerly awaiting additional maps from the developers.I'm hoping other maps will also be created by the community.

117796974	Only buy this if it is under $10 and you have friends to play with....The current state of the game is that it is dead, there is probably a player base of under 100 total players, and at most you will see maybe 5 other people online at a time... Its a very fun game to play with friends but is seriously over-priced. It should not be over $10, in its current state I have a hard time even pricing it at a value of $5 just because its impossible to even play the game with no player base... A message to the developers, please lower the price to revive your game, its very fun to play with friends but sad that its a dead and over-priced game.	----->	4

117825514	Fun game, addictive, but some systems lack polish, and overall it's a bit lacking in originality.It's very similar to other games of the genre like Banished and Dawn of Man. If you like those games, this one is worth checking out. It's not very difficult but it will keep your attention for a while, and it's fun to watch your settlement grow.Some of the game systems which might benefit from more polish are trade, estates, and villager promotions. Trade is kind of unsatisfying because it seems like you can never buy or sell as much as you'd like from other villages. I end up with massive stockpiles of some resources even though I've set them to be traded away. Similar situation for buying -- I only get very small amounts of the resources I need from other villages.Estates are a neat idea but the implementation isn't as fleshed out as it could be. The Kingdom missions don't really fit with the rest of the game, it feels like a weird minigame that doesn't quite belong. Labor and Clergy estates are pretty straightforward, and a nice twist on the tech-tree concept, but the ways you gain favor with those estates aren't really very interesting or challenging -- it's basically just waiting for an envoy to arrive and then sending off whatever resources they need, while also building up certain buildings in your own village to get more splendor. I think there's potential with this system but it needs to be more fully fleshed out.I think the villager promotion system is a bit wonky because there doesn't seem to be any good way to meet the villagers' needs at certain promotion levels. It's really hard to get the materials needed to satisfy certain tiers of villager because of the difficulty of obtaining iron. I'm constantly struggling to provide enough common goods and candles to my commoners, so I end up not promoting most villagers past serf level. It's also not clear to me what benefit it serves to promote the villagers in the first place, since keeping them at serf-level seems to be just fine.	----->	34

117837385	11/10 I cant think of a single thing wrong in this game it is an absolute blast with countless hours of replayability and fun. The mod community makes it even that so much better too! Only suggestion to creators would be a bit more difficulty whether in the form of a hard,easy, normal mode as well as a bit more unique playing styles. regardless game as it is is so amazing and a blast!! highly recommend you wont be disappointed.	----->	6
117838124	Started a fresh save Jan 28, 2023 and starting a list of things the game needs. I recommend it, but, wait for the next update. 1. the ability to open up the system menu by hitting esc. this is basic but for some reason they think it can't be done since esc is used to close windows????2. highlighting locations for notifications - for example there's no ability to see the single location that doesn't have resources for construction. It's just somewhere sorta close to the center of your screen so you click on multiple locations. same goes for highlighting villagers who have notifications3. something denoting the front of the building when placing new buildings - like a green arrow? - this is important based on the organic paths4. rejiggering of maintenance costs on buildings - few buildings should be 1 gold less IMO. you end up with too much maintenance costs that you have to tax your serfs like 50% to be able to build anything else and give them better food.5. to be able to see desirability area of effect for buildings after you build them. For example, how much does the well improve desirability? How close do you need to build your wells?6. wheat farm should produce more wheat than it does. I keep expanding the crop field too--------------------------------------------------- I'll update this later - but so far after 4 hours this is a cute little city builder game. I love love love the organic paths and the fact that you don't have to build each and every house separately. (Looking at you Banished.)The learning curve isn't terrible. The game is very chill. You have to be picky with the quests and sometimes just refuse them. The estates are a little tricky. I should have picked the kingdom. I didn't realize you can promote your serfs. Some of the UI is a little clunky with the editing/building. When you open a window for a building the bottom of the window might be below your screen. It needs some kind of tool tip adjustment.After 10+ hours of play time I have one pet peeve - You have multiple places for alert notifications - like a villager has no access to something they want and you can click on that notification and it moves the screen to that villager but the villager is not highlighted so you have no idea which of the little ants scurrying around down there is the unhappy one. Same goes for building notifications. You can know 8 buildings have full storage but you don't know which ones without just mindlessly clicking. I'm losing interest in this game as I wait for their next update. Last news about an update was Dec 2021 and it's July. I am looking forward to that update.	----->	26

118036754	It is a game of solving puzzles and trying to out think the room, for all puzzle enthusiasts everywhere. It works, and works well. The base game is fun and worthy of your play by itself.Where this game goes above and beyond is the WORKSHOP. Escape Simulator left open for users to create their OWN escape rooms, and the creativity and inventiveness of the users is outstanding. I log in almost every day to see what new rooms pop up to explore, and there's always unique visions. Some are even creating video games. I'm not kidding, they made video games in their escape room. How even?The support from the staff who made this game to encourage that kind of creativity really makes this a one of a kind experience that keeps on giving, and I can't wait for how this game will evolve in the future.	----->	13

118127110	I finished a vanilla game, meaning I did all that I could ATM. I also tried out (but just that) all the other maps. Above all, it is a beautiful game. The design of houses, etc., is great but the main reason is the absence of grid: most medieval city builders I know are based on it and that just does not feel right. (It does bring out a problem, though: sometimes a house will block the entrance of another house. ) The first person perspective would be most welcome, also because sometimes the best tactics is to do nothing for a while.A few other suggestions:- builders should be able to do some terraforming, at least for (big) churches and monasteries. - when I tried to delete a presbitery in order to add a nave extension to my church, the whole thing disappeared. Lesson learned but that is just not realistic: churches, monasteries and castles (and other building as well) were rebuilt all the time. Sometimes they did pull the whole structure down but usually they just demolished and rebuilt the parts that were insufficient. Side aisles are not available (yet?) either.- monasteries are for men only. That's as it should be, but they did have monasteries for women only as well, you know? Maybe one could put them next to each other, with the resulting happiness going through the roof.- no children. I know that was a design decision, but again, it does not feel right. Schools would not be necessary - churches, monasteries and keeps should take over kids' education.As for the difficulty, it feels just about right (once you know what you are doing). No bugs encountered.	----->	10

I love this game for the amazing graphics and the game play is one that you may go away from for a while but you will come back to it.  The characters are so cute as they scurry all over, building, chopping wood, tending the livestock, making cheese etc.  I for one, like games that are solid and have ongoing updates.  The team who have created Foundation know just the right time to come back and give you something new.  Enjoy Foundation!	----->	17

I like that the timer exists, but that it doesn't matter. You can take as long as you like to solve the room or race the clock. I appreciated that after you unlock the exit you can still stay in the room to hunt for the tokens.  For me this is a game where I play a level or two at a time rather than a binge and do them all in one sitting kind of game.	----->	11

118283696	Foundation is one of those simulation games that becomes super addicting as you play. Once you get the hang on how the economy works, how to employ your villagers, creating building sites, etc; this game is super fun and relaxing all in one. The constant struggle or challenge of expanding and growing your village whilst keeping the majority of your population happy is exciting. I like how you have control of almost every detail. It almost feels like Stronghold: Crusader and RollerCoaster Tycoon came together into one game. Highly recommend if you really enjoy playing simulation games.	----->	19

118388499	Foundation is a fun city simulator game that boasts a unique challenge, which makes the game extremely fun and re-playable. If you are the kind of person who has a lot of patience and has good strategy, you will never get tired of this game. However, if you prefer a faster pace experience and sandbox style gameplay, then this game is not for you. Overall, the amount of strategy and customization that comes with making a functional city, makes Foundation a fun and unique experience for those who are willing to wait a long time in order to see progress.	----->	15
118392722	A neat little town builder, very forgiving, where a lot of the minutia is taken care of for you. The main focus is creating a robust resource transport network, so no area of the town is without easy access to food/goods. It can be a little tedious with well and church placement (the upgraded version of the church does address this however) where any time you purchase a new territory you must put down 2 or 3 wells, and you still risk a creeping need for water in the tiny spots you miss. A suggestion would be to increase the radius that wells can be drawn from. I might also suggest, and I am no programmer so forgive my ignorance, that as npcs travel they can hit up any stall or well they pass, instead of having favorite spots near their homes. I understand they would prefer to work close to home but that is not always practical.	----->	3

118401528	Fully addicted to Foundation. I mean start playing at 10pm, look up its 4am type of game. Perfect ant-farm style city builder where you set things up, then watch your city grow. Pathing for citizens is great, the customizeable buildings is neat, overall good game.Only thing I do wish is that there was more. It was great unlocking all the building types, but once you reach that end, personally, the drive to continue has fallen off a bit. More building types, weapon types, etc. More trading options would be great as certain maps can be limiting (Mine had little iron which was a major inhibitor). Overall very fun game and plenty of depth to reach the $1/hr fun goal i set for games I get. 8/10	----->	19
118405171	Recommended based on the roadmap. I've been anticipating this game for the longest time. Eventually went ahead and purchased it once the UI was updated. It's a really fun game! So many games have tried to fill that Banished niche, and this is the closest to the feel I've found. Moreover, there are plenty of upgrades. Although painfully resource heavy, I love how the buildings work, and you can pretty much design anything here. I was honestly shocked about how open the gridless system was! That being said, there are some key things currently missing that would really benefit a game like this: - birth and death. Your villagers just kind of show up and never age.- sickness and health in general - seasons Thankfully those things appear to be planned. A couple of other issues I have:  - Religion. Your church fits a ridiculously small amount of people and I have to resort to cheesing it by hiding extra nodes within existing churches. This could be easily fixed by tweaking the capacity of the core building as it is. As it stands it's really just annoying. - There's a lot of waiting around for resources. - The mid-late game is a little boring for me. There's not a lot of optimisation or automation upgrades you can add as you progress, meaning that you're kind of bottlenecked at a point. Again, it's basically a case of waiting around for resources and the sense of progression is lost. Overall I really enjoy this game and want it to succeed. Given what's there, and what I've read of the roadmap, it looks to be a great game on release.	----->	14

118471030	Sort of a mix review. Yes, it can be fun and interesting. It's sort of laid back. I wished it was either more laid back, so I can walk away for a bit and come back without a worry, or more things going on. Right now, it's pretty much both. It's slow enough that I want to walk off and do something or cook dinner then come back, but there are some things that I still feel like I need to watch and if I walk away at the wrong time, I can mess something up. I also spend way to much time just trying to figure out something that seemed like it should be more easier to figure out. So, it can be a really satisfying experience, but it also can be a really frustrating experience. This game definitely needs more quality of life improvements and it literally is not worth playing without mods. The mods do add so much to the game, which is both a good and thing, and sort of a bad thing. What I mean is, I bought this product unfinished (I know, early access) but it's just not worth playing without mods that are adding in a ton of content that feels like the devs have should of done. It's good that it's easy to launch the game, and then get the mods you want, but it feels sort of like they are taking advantage of the free work. With that said, I haven't done really any research into this, so it maybe that some of these mods could be by the devs themselves but I haven't really noticed that yet.I do love a game that can add more life into it via mods. But I usually look for that from finished products and to see if I can either completely change the game, or change it towards a direction that's a bit different from the base idea. I love that. The amount of years I spent on Company of Heroes mods is absurd. But with a game that's still in Early Access basically requires mods to make the game more interesting and functional, I dunno. Yes, you can play the game without them, but it feels pretty lacking if you do.I'll allow comments so someone can correct me, just don't be an a**hole about it please.	----->	29

118535727	Great game. I only have 12 hours in this however. I have fun playing with others. We hoard and fight over the clues. I at first felt sad because it seems there is not so much in the way of dev created rooms. but I felt glad when I found out that there is an editor and can play other user's creations. I look forward to doing that and to create hard devious rooms for my friends. muhaaaa ha ha ha.  2 thumbs up and 2 big toes up.    (Oh, and very kid friendly also.) I haven't gotten the dlc because I feel the price is way too high. I would be willing if it were $ 0.99.  It just doesn't seem right that the cost of a few more dev created rooms costs 33% of the main game.  blah :(    I would like it to be easier to manipulate objects though. I find things under chairs for example but fight and fight to flip something over to look under it.  Removing hanging items from walls etc... Regardless... I would surely recommend this to ALL my friends and All my Not friends also.  Great double date night game  or family night game.	----->	10

118590426	I don't recommend this game if you want to have friends. Played a hole in one map and my guy never calls me again he said it was a horse sh1t map and he hates me and golf it. - 1 friend more to come.	----->	0

118596171	Very well designed and extremely reminiscent of the kind of puzzles you'd find in an actual escape room. My partner doesn't play video games but we've had a blast solving these rooms together with me controlling the character. Highly recommended if you like escape rooms.	----->	5
118600256	This game is an excellent relaxing and addictive city builder. You are constantly stepping up, optimizing, growing your cities from humble beginnings to huge fortress. 10/10 would recommend for the following reasons:- Huge potential for a city builder- Graphically superb and adapted for this kind of city builder- Watching your population do the work and always busy in the empire you are building is already utterly pleasant.- You cannot screw things up too badly- Challenge is constant if you want to keep growing- There is plenty of room for customization- The medieval theme is greatly used- The variety of ressources and jobs is interesting- The rythm of the game only depends on your choices, meaning that you can choose to optimize a certain step before going to the next etc.- The organic building of houses and pathways is a nice mechanic, which removes the annoying part of having to locate your hundreds on citizens, here they just keep on living and mention if they lack anything.If I was asked a few ideas to make this game even better:- Increase the customization possibilities- Add more theme to your villages (vikings or egyptian for example)- Add more map types- Add barbarians camps or enemy villages which you can fight with your soldiers or from which you must defend yourself- Increase the economic complexity, with offer and demand rates, shortage of ressources, more trading options, possibility to build hubs and huge ports- Add a possibility to define neighborhoods which would grant additional bonuses/maluses if used properly/wrongly.Keep on going devs, you are doing an amazing job	----->	15

118606732	this game never fails to remind me how incredibly dumb I am. It's a lot of fun but if you have **** for brains these rooms will definitely take you a while. either I didn't win the lottery when it came to the intelligent side of the gene pool or Pine studios went a little overboard making these rooms...spoiler alert probably a bit of both. It's a fun game nonetheless, but I'd definitely recommend playing the core game with friends. personally I have more fun playing community made rooms. They're still a challenge, but there's just so much packed in the core levels I don't know how anyone beats those levels in 15 minutes. The tutorial is literally NOTHING compared to the rest of the game which was rather disappointing because I was really looking forward to the levels and seeing what they had to offer, BUT if it was that easy the whole way through the game I suppose nobody would be buying the game now would they? Just beware every single level is pretty challenging IMO. Not gonna stop me from having fun though : D	----->	17

118625266	Minion Masters is a pretty awesome game with regular content updates and a great marketing model. The Premise is simple enough: You choose your champion and build a deck of spells and creatures that you throw at the other player until you win. It gets more complicated depending on your strategy, but by playing you get enough materials to craft/buy cards you want or gacha them with an in-game currency that's pretty easy to get just by playing the game. It's fun and I recommend it.	----->	17

118715699	The game overall is pretty fun and the puzzles are challenging, but not too hard. Also, if you do get stuck there's the hint button. I only have 2 things that I'd improve about this game: 1. MORE levels! After you get through the initial levels, you can only play community-made levels. 2. The hint button. It's helpful, but the first hint that comes out is whatever step you're supposed to do at the beginning of the level. So, if you only have 1 more key to find or door to unlock, you have to spend a lot of time clicking through all of the hints that you've already solved. Also, if you've just clicked the button, you can't just click it again for another hint, you have to wait 15-30ish seconds. Besides that, the game is very fun and enjoyable :)	----->	9

118793906	Foundation is a good and in some aspects groundbreaking village builder, that is highly enjoyable if you like the classic “walker” genre. It is also a bit light on content and still very much early access (as well for UI and QoL).  With mods however - particularly Batyushki’s incredible modpack - this game is elevated to pure magnificence. It is everything I wanted from a medieval city builder and then some more. Pro’sThere’s a few things vanilla Foundation does really right: - the grid free system: the painter tool looks a bit crude but it does work extremely well. One of the best parts of the game is how organic houses and roads are created and villages get naturally connected.  - the free form building tool: there are a couple of building “sets”, like the manor, church, tavern and keep, that consist of several parts that can be added at will, customized in height and placed as often as you like. This allows for a huge amount of creativity that takes a while to get fully into. There’s also “masterpieces” included, like statues, fountains and even a main gate.  - the art style of the game: at first I doubted the cartoony look but in-game I it actually hits the right balance between charm and realism. Screenshots can be quite amazing to look at, and the bad weather effects are quite atmospheric. Cons:- villager pathing. As in every walker game, the villager pathing is not ideal. Because every villager has a work, food, rest, water, house cycle, it takes some practice to understand why there can be food shortage for example when there’s food. Some people might think the game is bugged while they don’t understand these cycles. For example, transporters have to bring food to granaries and only then a market tender can pick it up. If your food is not abundant, they will only bring small amounts, and sometimes go all across the map when there’s closer options nearby. When a villager has his “eating” moment, but the stall is empty, it will not satisfy the need for that day and only return after a full cycle. Then if unlucky it might hit an empty stall again next day.    There is a quite a bit of a learning curve, because some things you just have to find out along the way, and this makes the first 10 hours basically learning. Some placements can be finicky, and especially bridges are notoriously annoying. (Clear the bridge of overlapping buildings, and then reload to reset the pathing). On my second run I had a lot of fun on the Hills map, building small pockets of villages across the map and letting them connect naturally. However, rather soon you might feel limited in how your village looks.Because of the way villagers & zoning work it is difficult to really create a medieval town. Most likely you end up with a sort of village sprawl, because villagers refuse to spawn housing near the city center when there’s no new jobs around, which makes for the unrealistic sprawl effect. Also, once paths are in place, they won’t build on it. (You can use the “forbidden land” zoning tool, but it takes time for paths to de spawn again). While houses will upgrade to a tier 2 stone version (after promoting villagers), there are no stone roads and stone castle parts as of yet. This and the sprawl issue means your village will never really become a densely packed stone town. Fishing huts remain shacks and there’s no options for dock and quay construction in vanilla.Mods With mods however all this can be fixed, and then some more. You can place housing manually, with lots of stone variations. There’s better and more farms, docks, manor upgrades etc. If you like to create a true medieval region map, with several villages, towns, farms, mining hamlets, etc and have the patience to really work for your food and materials, then the Batyushki modpack will keep you playing for dozens & dozens of hours. Look at discord for some of the amazing towns people built, or Batyushki’s own Tour of Arras on YouTube (recommended!). I generally don’t like using mods, but the game is well integrated for the modding community. You can download mods in-game with just a click and they work fine. PriceAs for the price, I think the base game is a little bit overpriced but the 25% sale makes it just right. Mods however are free, so if you take that value into account the game becomes a steal even at the regular price of 30 euro’s. FutureAs for the future, there’s a big update coming soon that reworks the progression system. Development of this game is steady but it does seem rather slow as well. They have communicated the aim of full release before the end of 2022, but most likely it will go beyond that as the big 1.9 update still has to come out.Tl, dr; enjoyable village builder that is right for the sale price but because of its strong foundation can be elevated to a whole new level of magnificence with mods.	----->	23

118820543	Does a wonderful job at exercising the brain's problem solving center. Buggy on certain objects but it's usually resolved by simply clicking the item again. Never crashes, never gets stuck in walls. simple intuitive controls. looks exactly like the cover art. free community built rooms made with a free builder supplied by the developers. I think you can create and import your own textures into custom rooms as well. first few room updates were free, and they gave their other game, cats in time free additional levels. I bought the Steam Punk DLC so Pine could continue to give us more content. Can't wait to see what the next theme will be, I personally love dragons and would be ecstatic to have a dragon lair escape room.	----->	15

118833751	This game is really excellent. It uniquely captures the spirit of Resistance, Werewolf, and other large group social deduction games with a 1v1 competitive atmosphere. It can be a funny, lighthearted game or a really sweaty, strategic game.I know there aren't a lot of players but it never goes on sale and I've always found randoms to play against so I'd say it's worth just getting it at $25 if you watched youtube and liked what you saw. It is what it is, and playing it feels good.	----->	8
118845132	This is a great game, the philosophy of the developers is admirable as far as I can tell. The gridless format, the organic roads, and the whole game play has kept me playing the game long after I should've retired for the night. It is totally immersive, and makes you think about your strategies. I recommend this game, if you like city building with a focus on your strategy, this is the game for you.	----->	7
118850475	Highly recommended in co-op, very fun and well done overall. I love that there are different themes. I wish there was even more rooms to play!	----->	10
118853991	There is no story, no levels and eventually you find a meta strategy. But it's still a very chill and addictive medieval city builder with clear UI.Yes, at some point all becomes easy and you start creating challenges for yourself as there is no endgame content yet. Like choosing a start hexes on islands or with lack of resources nearby? But I'm afraid that you will get bored even by that and that's why this game needs more developer/user made maps and challenges with specific objectives (using Steam Workshop for example).Anyway, till that you will have 30 hours on record already and it's worth that price.	----->	-5

119098488	Honestly the best minigolf game on Steam. Are the graphics good? No. Are the controls precise? Also no. Is the game reliable? I only crashed once so maybe.What's the big benefit over Golf With Your Friends then? Answer: huge modding community with a ton of custom courses and an inability to solve courses perfectly every time you play thanks to the motion based controls. Unlike GWYF every game is an adventure as you try to wrangle the controls which honestly makes the gameplay much more fun. Highly recommended.	----->	13

119153363	I was looking for a new game to play with a buddy remotely.  This popped up on sale, and we'd both been eyeing it oddly enough. We picked it up and have had a blast. At first we needed a lot of hints, but as we got into it, the clues just fell together. Not too easy, not insanely difficult, but a really nice middle ground where you have to think, but there's no moon logic to get from puzzle A to B. The levels also flow really well together too, meaning once you unlock that 1st puzzle the next is right there ready to be solved.Then there's the community levels. The main levels could be completed in a few hours depending on your skill level, so having all the community levels out there means you have an almost endless supply of fun on your own or with friends. Overall, if you love puzzles and escape rooms, this game is a lot of fun. Adding in your friends is easy and makes it that much more fun.	----->	9

119305015	Last update in 2020. Developer sleeping on this and let the hype die. For a game that was estimated for 2 years of develop time, it's now going on 4 years with 2 of them with not a single update or sale given. It's unfortunate as the game concept is great and the detail given so far (other then the menu's and ways to connect) is done nicely. Game play isn't bad and the overall system is smooth other then the menus.Just without progress, room for adjusting the price down as $25 USD is way too much for a early access game that has not moved in years. There is no proof this game will finish and the developer is showing that and that's a clear red flag to not buy this game.  If you need examples of what is a good early access game price, look at games like Vampire Survivors, Project Zomboid, and Phasmophobia. Overall, avoid. Very little chance this game will finish and doubt the developer will reconsider and turn things around.	----->	6
119316510	This game is great. The guy making it sort of slowly works on it in his free time. It's finished so don't let the early access tag scare you away. You're going to have a hard time playing as a new person because most people have been doing this for years. If you got a buddy to learn with, do that.	----->	-2

119337796	If you're into puzzles and escape rooms, I highly recommend this game. Consider the included levels an intro to how the game works and how to approach puzzles. The real fun comes with the hundreds of community created workshop levels. There are many many high quality (imo which far surpass anything the base game includes) user created rooms which will provide endless hours of fun. This game is more fun when played coop with a friend.	----->	9

119401954	Absolutely worth the Early Access purchase.  One of my favorite games to watch grow.  Mods fill in some missing aspects, but the base by itself will eat up many hours.

119465028	The best City Builder I have played so far. A nice blend of a controlled and planed building system with some random elements to your residential area. Nicely balanced economy which you can hold steady, improve or mess up. But even then, the game doesn't punish you too hard, so that you can always make a comeback.

119530162	the community rooms are often a lot of fun but some seem to get stuck because of a lack of hints and there is no walkthrough but most are fairly linear or hinted well so you can keep playing more and more rooms besides just what is official. I love that sort of playability. The official rooms are very fun and have different levels of difficulty to them so some feel easier and some feel harder. The mechanics of this games are easy to understand and extremely helpful, and everything runs smoothly. I like that you can play alone or with other people.	----->	7
119533757	Super fun and engaging medeival city building game! I've enjoyed playing it	----->	4
119537776	The game is pretty fun, with a good variety of puzzles to solve. Decent co-op experience with one or two friends. None of the levels are really re-playable since they aren't randomized, but there are a good amount of levels in the game. There are also community workshop maps, some of which are really impressive and more being made every day. I will probably keep coming back to this game for years, similar to Human Fall Flat, just to see new dev maps and new workshop maps.While definitely the best escape room type game out there, the levels also leave you wanting more. There are sequences to the puzzles where you keep advancing in the same biome, but they don't feel like they are a continuation of the previous puzzle, moreso just another puzzle in the same type of environment. I think this game would be a lot better if they could solve this issue. Many workshop maps have worlds designed where you feel like you are solving some grander puzzle throughout, with many connected rooms, entire houses, compared to the dev maps where everything happens in a 10x10 room. I guess I shouldn't knock the devs too much, because they clearly built a great custom map system that players have been able to leverage to make works of art.	----->	23

119617856	I played Sim City 2000, Caeser, Pharoah, Tropico and the like back in the day. Age, experience, travel, time-constraints, and reading a lot of Strong Towns soured me on the typical automobile traffic sim of modern settings, and period settings still have an excessive amount of central planning and rigidity in an era of some pretty convincing AI.Enter Foundation. It is the best I've seen so far at balancing the kind of organic building and development that was the way cities were built for thousands of years. It's GRIDLESS! I love that your villagers make their own paths and roads and build their own houses. The only thing it is missing for me is multi-use buildings. If the villagers could live above their shop or on their farm, that would be the cherry on top of this ice cream sundae of city builders.There are a plethora of historic city builders and colony/survival sims or whatever now. They look beautiful, and I'm sure they're great, but every time I think seriously about trying something else I look at how square and un-lifelike they appear with all their perfectly straight paths and roads and people living exactly where you put them. I can't go back.	----->	15

119618848	Note: this review is for v1.8.This game has a lot of potential and it's already enjoyable.Looking at the community screenshots it seems like the big fun is building these gorgeous castle landscapes. Personally, I feel like the tools the game provides make this pretty daunting for a new player. The quest mechanism teaches new players how to manage the key resources of the game, but it doesn't do enough to show you how to build a cool and large building. How much space should you be reserving for a keep or a church? I'd like to see some default pre-built versions of the various buildings, just to give new players a starting point and inspiration. I'd also like to see mechanical rewards for building cool things. Why should I spend an hour and hundreds of resources building something purely decorative? I guess some players find that motivation enough, but personally I feel like the game systems should incentivize doing the core fun thing.There are also some tweaks I'd like to see:* Why does this game support and encourage mods, but doesn't support Steam Workshop? And why does it kick you out to the web browser to view description text for mods?* On max game speed I find myself sitting around for minutes at a time waiting for immigrants to arrive or buildings to finish. I would suggest that the current 3x speed should be normal speed, and a much faster speed implemented.* There may be things about the game pace that deserve tweaking other than the speed. Perhaps the immigration speed, or some of the production ratios. As a new player, once I'm several hours in and I've experienced most of the unlockable economic buildings, it feels like I should be able to accelerate the growth of my town rather than just wait as villagers arrive by 2s and 3s.	----->	37
119623557	> This is a very good escape room simulator game to test your mind.> It would take time to learn the room editor mechanics, but once you get used to it you would be creating    rooms non stop.  > The community rooms are awesome as you get to see the creativity and effort put into it by the players.	----->	6

Would definitely recommend, even if you do not have any friend to play with!UPDATE: after having played this game for over 55 hours now, it's definitely one of my all time favorite games on steam. i also appreciate the fact that the devs release new DLC every now and then!	----->	11

119904120	Fantastic gameStarts off pretty basic, then grows more and more complex as you need to learn to balance new systems and growth. Music is fantastic, Maps are very beautiful, and its just a super super chill game.Variable game speed allows you to set a pace, you can either crank it to three and play meticulously as things pop off fairly quickly, or you can play at one and just have it on a second screen and interact periodically (for most stages of the game, it does get more interactive later into the game).AFAIK the developer is in process of releasing its 2nd or 3rd major patch which is also a positive sign.If I had one negative thing to say about it, is I wish they would add some sort of collision detection for the Villagers when they choose where to build a house. Often they will build their homes attached to other buildings (especially churches and manors), which does impact the visuals to a degree. It is a relatively minor nitpick, because as the game progresses you will eventually spend more time zoomed out as you progress from controlling a little settlement, into a city to a small kingdom.Edit:Forgot to add, once you learn how to get the villagers to walk where you want them making paths, you can make some awesome looking cities. Great use of the villagers and means that no two cities will ever look the same.Fantastic game, solid 5/7. Book it. Drunk.	----->	14

The one major problem is that there are no save points, which bumped my hours very high. It comes with a builder and there are hundreds of very good free community developed maps. Highly recommended!	----->	5
119952081	It's all the challenging fun of a real-life escape room that you can enjoy in the comfort of your own home!  Plus, it lets you do things that you couldn't do in a real-life escape room, such as use magic or go to space!	----->	6
119955919	I really liked the puzzles! I fully completed it within 12 hours. However first time I solved puzzle and during second walkthrough I unlocked all achievements with my friends.

120082653	I would rate the BASE game like a 7/10 not very many levels and they are just okay. But what takes this game to an EASY 10/10 is the workshop. Holy crap there are literally thousands of player created levels and most of them are INCREDIBLE. Endless content from the workshop is truly is what makes this game.	----->	-1

120306317	You can play at normal speed for a fun relaxed game or at 3 times speed to keep yourself more busy. Great game I'm thoroughly enjoying it.4 out of 5It can be a bit annoying when villages are complaining about no food or comfort, when they are right next to a market or a free house, but other than that, a good game.	----->	9

120311252	Its pretty much golf. You have a club and a ball and you put it in the hole just like golf. So its golf. But more like golf than golf if you were to ask me. Golf is how i would describe this game. There are golf clubs and golf balls and also golf clubs but also golf balls. So its golf. Yeah... it's golf i'd say. Golf.	----->	5
120323244	good	----->	3
120329940	This is(to my knowledge one of, if not the best, escape room game on steam, workshop support is fantastic, and the devs seem to genuinely care about their product. This is a winner, I'd recommend it to anyone.	----->	5
120337555	I'm usually more of an Age of Empires style RTS player when it comes to strategy, but this, this is brilliant. Wonderful atmosphere, great depth, but easy enough to get into quickly. If you're not interested in playing the most difficult, crazily overloaded Anno style game, this game is for you. As I said, I'm usually not a citybuilder when it comes to gaming, but this, this is great for me as a city building newbie. It might be a little on the light side for hardcore city builder, but for me it's the most fun out of any city building game I've tried so far. I've never gotten into them more than a handful o9f hours, but here I'm 20 hours in, still interested, still having fun. Definitely worth its money.	----->	15

120393426	Escape Simulator is amongst the best puzzle games of all time in my opinion. The game has co-op feature and can be played up to 8 players (best with 2-3 players though). The gameplay is pretty straightforward where you basically need to look for things in a room and try to solve the puzzles to escape. The content is quite endless thanks to the hundreds of rooms made by the community. Highly recommended. 9/10.	----->	7

I find that sometimes things are not well explained so you have to head to the community page or reddit for more info (outdated tho because it had quite a few update). Might be worth it to post more there to have the game steered the right way.But overall good experience. Little info: take it slow. Don't grow too fast, or else it's easy to  make everyone unhappy.	----->	6

Just complex enough to be enjoyable, but once you get the hang of the economic systems and how the little villagers operate, very satisfying to grow your village.

121341296	The game is amazing. I have done many different maps with various ideas on how to build my town. The game offers a lot of creativity when it comes to building and designing, and this gives the game a lot of replayability. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city building games and is looking to try something a little different. The game graphics also have their own charm to it and I really enjoy the style they chose. It is simple but pleasant to look at. I'm excited for the new 1.9 update to come out and I encourage anyone reading this to give it a try!	----->	17
121344484	extremely fun and great for the mind if you love escape rooms you will love this	----->	12
121345088	Golf it is a Game that would have you playing with random people from all over for hours, Many times you may find yourself talking with many people who want to enjoy a either trolling golf game or a traditional golf game there is no shortage of people playing this game as it is very map creator friendly and there are hundreds of good maps to play with your pals for hours so I thought I'd give this a good review. Still in Early Access not sure when a full release will come but the games been out since 2017 so check it out if you love Golf with your friends but want a game with unlimited maps.If you buy this game for achivements this game sucks for that as they want you to post in the workshop for nearly half of those achivements. I do mean post like full 18 hole maps!	----->	12

It has made my friend and I think quite a few times on how to do something and we even got stuck on one part of an Egyptian puzzle for about 45 minutes before it finally clicked with us how to accomplish it.

The only negative point is that I found some bugs - it didn't prevent me from playing but some of them were really annoying (they happen more frequently on co-op mode tho)	----->	-1

I also like that you can stack the church/keep/manor buildings on top of each other so you increase the space without sprawling. Makes things quite interesting!	----->	15

121703464	As my first try at a city-building game, and I would recommend this to any beginners to the genre who have an appreciation for a charming medieval aesthetic. The progression and economic system make sense, and there is a delightful visual variety to the buildings, but by far I'm the biggest fan of following the medieval villagers waddle around about their business. As this is early access, and I am about 10 hrs in right now, my main criticism is the tutorial window. I am absolutely a proponent of games which don't hand-hold, and this quality factors well into Foundation's satisfaction, but presently the instructions could use enlargement (some pictures are too small for the words to be easily readable), and some sections like Trading and Mineral Prospecting could use more clarity. That said, if you're willing to be patient, I don't foresee major difficulty. I  have every confidence that the final product will be very well-worth the purchase, considering its thoroughly-enjoyable current state.A couple pro tips:-Don't build too fast, so that maintenance costs don't eat too much of your base coffer-Invest in market stalls which sell food: will generate reliable revenue, especially in a bad weather event, or if you need a while to figure out trading-Build a manor house and assign parts of the building as treasuries to increase your coffer; also definitely assign one as a great hall for receiving envoys-If you're planning on promoting your villagers from newcomer to serf, take note of where the individuals work and make sure there is enough cleared residential area painted for them to build houses: critical for encouraging immigration-You don't have to promote anyone at the start of the month if you don't want to, but be sure that you are prepared to meet their needs if you do, as exemplified by the previous point for the promotion from newcomer to serfIf you've read to the end, take it from me that this is a good game. The time it takes you to figure it out effectively rewards you. Huzzah!	----->	25

The puzzles themselves are really well done, requiring logic and problem solving while keeping things fresh and new with each puzzle.  And yet, they aren't so complicated that you'll get bogged down for very long.If you enjoy the We Were Here series of co-op games but want something similar that is singleplayer, this is a great option.

121897799	Having played an hour or so in VR I can say:  Pros:    - Hitting the ball in VR felt great and the controls were simple and good.    - Really enjoy the ability to play with people in VR as well as standard users.    - Played an original map as well as a Hogwarts mod map on an online server, both are great fun.     - It seems not too hardware taxing (I had no probs 90fps at High Resolution, High Settings with RTX3080)  Cons:    - The button for switching to left-handed isn't working (I simply played with my controller in both hands to overcome this, hope to see it fixed in the future.)    - I think a setting for different anti-aliasing should be added as I saw the grass would flicker a little bit.Conclusion:    I recommend it for use in VR. :) It was cheap for me at £2.99 as I got it on sale however if you have to pay a bit more I would still recommend it. It was fun, easy to get going and with mod maps, there is long-term fun to be had.  	----->	19

121977149	I actually really like Foundation. It's a cute little game with good mechanics, a fair bit of difficulty. It has a bit of a learning curve, not too crazy though. So if you learn slow, you can still find yourself enjoying this game. If you've had twelve divorces. You're going to hate this game, because you never learn from your mistakes. Do ya?Foundation is definitely recommended by me. Get it! Got it? Good.	----->	8
121985192	First of I want to mention that the game is very cute and well done for an EA title, and I enjoyed playing it, and I suggest you give the game a chance if you're into building games and have no issue supporting EA titles. Hey Devs, I encountered a gamebreaking bug where, after placing a sheep farm, all related buildings (weaver, tailor) would disappear. I tried to load an earlier save and restart game and PC as was suggested in a forum, but to no avail.I'll install again in a few months, hoping for some updates and bufixes. Really awesome game!	----->	12

Those who may have experienced glitches with the early release will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations and user friendliness the new upgrades have afforded. It's a gentler learning curve with the new tutorial, and vets of the genre will slide into the village building with ease. Fans of gentle and relaxing games will find Foundation well worth their investment.	----->	2

122249665	Escape Simulator is a puzzle game set in Egyptian, space, mansion and office themed escape rooms.If you’ve played any similar games most of the puzzle types will feel familiar. Search around the room and look inside drawers and other containers to find keys and other important items and clues. Decipher symbols and riddles to identify numbered codes, use letters to spell passwords, rearrange pictures into the correct order, and use spare parts to repair machines.Most of the puzzles are well designed. The store page seems to suggest that playing coop is best, but I had no problems playing solo. In most cases the puzzles need to be solved one at a time anyway to acquire the next item or clue that is needed to solve the next puzzle. It took me 9 hours to complete the official rooms and in addition to this there are community designed rooms which I haven’t tried yet, so there’s a lot of content. However, this game has one significant flaw – your progress within each room is not saved. If you exit the game before completing a room, you’ll have to start that room again from the beginning.One of the most important tools in my puzzle solving arsenal is simply walking away when I’m stuck, and then trying again later. Usually when I come back to a puzzle and look at it again with fresh eyes, I’ll see something that I missed before, or I’ll have a different idea about how to interpret the clues. But doing that in this game could mean losing 10-15 minutes of progress on multiple other puzzles within the room, so on the few occasions that I was seriously stuck, I felt pressured to solve it immediately.There were a few times, especially in the space and office themed rooms, where I needed a 3 digit code to enter into a 0-9 keypad, but because there was something that I didn’t understand in the moment and I didn’t want to have to do the whole room again, I just sat and brute forced it. 000. 001. 002. 003. And yeah, I got it done eventually, but I didn’t enjoy having to do that. If the game would save my progress, I’m sure I would have been able to solve those puzzles properly, which would have been much more fun.Overall Escape Simulator is a good game, but that one serious design flaw causes some moments of extreme frustration that I don’t usually feel while playing my favourite puzzle games.	----->	9

122288798	A fun and relaxing city-building game with lots of charm! Very addictive--I played nonstop the first week I got it. The community on Discord is nice, too, and the devs really pay attention and care about the things that the community brings up to them. Lots of replayability, since as soon as you get everything ramped up you realise you could have done it all better and want to start all over. Don't let the early access scare you--it's totally playable as-is.	----->	6

I am an old school gamer, been doing it since the late 70's and Ive come to the stage in my life that I just want to play a building/strategy game thats pretty casual and with almost unlimited options. This game fits and ticks the boxes. IT is fun, interesting and no game is ever the same.	----->	3

122651302	Well, fun game. Really nice graphics, and gameplay... for almost everything. some suggestions:Please add school or library associated to the monastery. Essential for mathematics for siege weapons; and astronomy for navigation and long distance trading with port and luxurious goods (spices and fruits).Salt was essential for conserving the food on those times, as well as the smoked food.Military could have a bit more interest challenges, and units (infantry, archers, siege weapons, etc) . Siege a city, attack a port, blockade to a port/city,Cultural/entertainment the news reader, the speaker, the street clown, theatre, medieval fair with duels ground/horses.And I got a bit lost with the potential castle...the mechanics of construction.Please add more scenarios!!	----->	6
122651412	Great game, very fun to play with friends and I can reply it since my memory is so bad I don't remember the puzzles. There's an others map called Cats in Time referencing a game of the same name that has adorable little cats.

122671009	This is a great escape room game.  I highly recommend it for everyone that loves escape room games.  The puzzles are fun and creative, the graphics are clean and the game has very few bugs if any.  Collecting the extra tokens is a fun challenge as well.  The devs keep updating the game and have added free content and it supports community rooms.	----->	15
122673417	A great game!The dev. created puzzles are interesting and challenging.Playing the first few rooms you are greeted with a great puzzle to space ratio, the only problem is that the rooms are kind of smallish.With the Steampunk DLC the rooms are more spacious which give the player more room to move around and explore!The community created rooms are very hit or miss in my opinion.Most creator put in allot of effort in the puzzles, but the dressing up of the room/theme feels kind of rushed in most cases.They are great if immersion is not a great priority, or if you are a Sudoku fan looking for a new way to play Sudoku.	----->	18

122798291	I've just realised I haven't reviewed this game yet. After 130+ hours put into this game at the time of the review, I can say that I am going to play Golf It as long as I can. THE MAIN reason is FRIENDS. Chilling late night with a handful of friends on discord simply make from this game the perfect vibe. Secondly, this game has endless content because of the steam's workshop (a blessing btw) so you cannot get bored. There is a lot of variety and fun maps to play, and if you have time to spare you can create a map too.The price is meaningless. It is totally worth it... whether you buy it for 4.99 or 8.99. TRY IT.To sum up, I recommend you to tell a few of your's friends to get this game (if they do not agree, obey them).  If the developers don't abandon the game and keep adding updates to create new content using workshop Golf It definitely will keep its spot on my favourites list for a long period of time.	----->	10
122815213	Although there are many historic city builder games, Foundation has balanced fun with challenge better than most. The graphics and artwork and organic nature of the building is part of what makes this game great.  I love that the villagers choose where to build their own house.  The challenge (among others) is laying out your village in a way that lets them have access to all they need, but keeping the desirability high...location, location, location.  Lots of develops through the Early Access phase...can't wait to see what comes next.	----->	7

122898236	This is my absolute favorite casual game. If you like puzzle games, this is the game for you. The aesthetic is wonderful and the gameplay is simple yet elegant. The mechanics for completing puzzles are some of the most original ideas I have come across in a puzzle game. The levels have so much playability to them as you want to beat your best time in the room over and over again. The added task of finding the tokens makes each room a new experience every time as you try to outsmart yourself to find them. I would genuinely play this game non-stop if the devs continued to create more rooms. Getting the notification that an update is available is the highlight of opening steam, because then I get to play more content. I am absolutely enthralled with this game. <3	----->	14

I had it in my steam account for a couple of months, and you know what, after playing it - I enjoyed it thoroughly!The controls are very easy to use, and the overall aesthetic is lovely. It was a fun game that worked well as both co-op and as single player, and even though there are only 4 levels, with multiple sub-levels each, the sheer amount of the user made games make it a game that pays for itself over and over! Loved every second of playing this, with great puzzles and fun for everyone involved!	----->	8

123040585	I truly believe the developers have created something special with this game. It's unlike other games of its type due to the very organic way your town comes to life.I won't lie. It has some initial learning curves, but once you get the hang of how everything works - and in my opinion; SHOULD work with a game like this - it turns into something magical and relaxing. It's been my go-to for post-hard days at work. My therapy if you will. :) And, each time an update is done, I've noticed that it's always for the better. It always makes me excited to start a new town to see what else I can build with new features.	----->	5

123093815	Okay so here is my review even though I give myself 25 hours till I leave a review at 8 hours I think I have played and seen enough of escape simulator to give my thoughts This is normally the time frame that i feel i have seen and done enough to say something about the game. To the review.[h1] Graphics [/h1]  7/10This kind of game is not graphic demanding and its not that type of game. My score of 6 is not a reflection of the graphics not being good its just not that type of a game and to put a higher number would only just pump up the overall score without the game being a AAA kind of game. The graphics are really good though each item is clear, and the designs are fun both base and community content. The rooms and environments are fun to play in and it never gets boring[h1] sound and music [/h1]  5/10Again, like many scores the sound and music is not something this game needs to or does well. Its basic with sounds of various objects being interacted with and the music itself I find to mute as it all gets quite repetitive and in the way after a while[h1] game play [/h1]  9/10This is where the game shines. This is a great sit back with your controller and work stuff out chilled out game. It will get you brain going and a hand pad and pen will be needed to note stuff down. You play themes levels each with puzzles tied into that theme all blended with superb environments. The solo game is great for chilled out games and the coop is so much fun when you want to have a blast with a friend solving the rooms. The game play is a warm welcome when you want a break from the RPG and shooters in your library. This is a go to game every now and again when I want a break and not be hunched up over my desk.[h1] controls [/h1]   8/10Overall controls are great not many buttons and all of them placed perfectly on the game pad with the exception of a couple things like placing stuff around or dragging items but nothing too game breaking. Not sure about using a keyboard and mouse but I would imagine these are fine as well but this is a great game for once to lean back in a chair away from the monitor to play with a gamepad. [h1] Story [/h1]    7/10Again its hard to put a higher score on the story as its not the kind of game that has a story other than themed escape rooms all linked in to each other however the puzzle writing and concept would play a part in the story for each room and these are done very well[h1] conclusion [/h1]    The game is a gem and one that has come a long way and compared to many in the genre this one has the brain teasing fun element with its cartoon style graphics and challenging puzzles. The community-based content is great as well to see what ideas others come up with. With regular community rooms added daily and monthly you are never to short of having a challenge with also the option to make up your own escape rooms as well. Solo or coop this game is perfect in your library of games when you want something relaxing but also challenging without the mouse and button mashing Overall solid 36 out of 50  for the game  This game gets a star buy token as it is a great game The overall score is not reflection of the game itself as this game is quite unique to most other games where graphics, score , sound effects are important elements of the game. This game although looks good does not depend on nor does it try to be the best in these areas and that is why the review is scored low in these areas and not because they are bad	----->	71
123099254	Wasn't sure about this game after playing for a few minutes with a friend, but it quickly became addicting and I honestly really love the design. Really fun solo or with a friend.	----->	7
123099537	A game of escape rooms. If you like escape rooms, you will like this game. The controls are intuitive enough so that even someone who doesn't play video games should be able to figure it out. The provided rooms are great, and the game allows you to play user created rooms as well for infinite replayability. You can even play with friends as well, though not with random people. All in all, this is a great game.	----->	5

123264411	This game rocks! The puzzles are all very diverse and creative, and the environments are beautiful and well-crafted.  My biggest issue with this game is the quality control, as there are a few grammatical errors within it.  Apart from that, the ongoing updates to this game as well as the community support will keep this game thriving for the foreseeable future.  It is well worth $15, and the DLC is a great buy at $5 as well!	----->	8

123412659	I bought this game for my girlfriend and I to play on vacation. I really wasn’t expecting too much. Interestingly enough, the puzzles are very well thought out and numerous. They are actually harder than the escape rooms I have done in real life lol. In real life, you have to know how to do sudoku, figure out some anagrams here and there - but this one has me looking at molecular science! Lol. Thankfully there’s a hint option, that can provide decent help. But even with the hints…don’t expect an easy game!	----->	0

All of the puzzle rooms are fun, with different themes and interactive objects and lots of hidden tokens to find. But it's the immense creativity of the workshop creators that makes this one of my absolute favorite games in my library. My friend and I have escaped so many times. The universe wants to contain us. We cannot be contained.	----->	5

I also massively enjoy watching my settlers placing their own houses in the wackiest places and watching them carve out their own pathways.	----->	8

I really wish they would add a full sandbox/free insta-build mode just to mess around, train, learn, play with mods or just generally try to create eye candy.	----->	8

123685639	It's a bit of an addictive game. Very good tools and mechanics, and I easily sunk quite some time into the game. That being said. I have some thoughts.Pros:- It's the literal definition of non-linear gameplay. No storyline to follow besides occasional quests, you can build and rule basically however you want. - The mechanics aren't anything new, city building, survival, and resource management. But you get enough of it to play around.- A variety of professions for your villagers to choose from, with a shallow choice for you to intervene and influence their life choices- The options for building and decorating are mild at best, nothing worth writing about, but the mod community made it worth playing for.- The villager progression system does quite a significant in making you feel accomplished to increase their quality of life. Cons- Starting from the last Pro, the modding community is the only thing worth playing the game for, even then nearly half the mods are outdated with little activity in terms of update- Once a mod dies, a significant portion of your gaming interest goes with it- Updates have been extremely slow, haven't played in quite some time, and there's still no changes from the last time I played. A lot of posts, but barely any that would pique your interest in replaying.- Once a map runs its course, that's basically it, it's done- Modded maps are good, but my OCD picked out the texturing issues for it, a lot of clipping going around.- The game has some finicky balancing issues where if you've got bad RNG, your mid-to-late game will suffer horribly that it's practically game over. Some may argue it's just bad planning, but when you've got surplus of 3 different foods, yet a majority of your population are starving. That ain't it, chief. If you've read other reviews, I share the same sentiment. Great potential as a city builder game, cute graphics, great approach, but it barely scratched the surface of its potential, and until more content is drawn out or released, a lot of people are just generally bored of it.	----->	9

123707392	These are the best escape rooms on the market. Grab a friend, and work through them (try not to use hints! so much more gratifying). This is a blast and well worth every penny.	----->	4
123740220	The rooms included in the base game are great but the awesome thing about this game is you're getting so much more out of all the community rooms. Escape Room enthusiasts have been creating community rooms consistently every month you can easily download for free from within the game or off the Steam Workshop to play solo or coop.These usually have custom assets and puzzles and interactions/animations in the rooms so it's a totally unique experience every time. I've been super impressed with what some of the creators have been able to pull off. I haven't used the room editor myself but it must be pretty robust considering what I've played.Online coop works great so if you have a friend or 2 you want to escape with, you're all set. For the money, it's the best online escape room experience I've ever done.	----->	24
123746265	Great for people who actually hate their friends	----->	-3
123750995	A fun escape game with original levels that are pretty challenging but with enough variety to keep you entertained for some hours.

A lot of 'community content driven' games die out because the community doesn't engage with the game, but the publishers/Devs keep incentivizing people to build rooms and keep the community going. The trickle of new DLC for parts + official rooms add a lot to keep people coming back and building more	----->	7

124089922	It's a fun game but they should try and make it better for co-op. Like I understand that it's literally just an escape room but idk. Playing this game is super fun though. If you like puzzles, then you'll like this game. Def worth the purchase. I like the themes for each level and how they're different from each other. The only other critique is that the hints lowkey suck lol. The dance moves were a great add. I rate this game an 8.5/10 :)	----->	20

124094882	Recommended – 8.5/10The Good:  Not much of a story here, you appear in a room and must find a way to open the door to escape.  However, you can find small notes/hints that can reveal some small details about what was going on.  There are several groups of rooms, each with a different theme.  This keeps things interesting and makes you want to explore every different room you find yourself in.  Puzzles also vary between rooms and themes keep them feeling fresh.  Once you’re done with a room, there’s not much of a reason to play it again as nothing is changed.  Fortunately, there are new rooms that come out from the developers and from the community that keep the game going.  You can even make your own rooms if you want.The Bad:  The main issue I have is with the clock.  All of the puzzles are doable, but the clock kept putting unneeded pressure to look at hints.  I tried to ignore it, but it’s usually in a very prominent place.  The only other issue is with the inventory and how you can put quite a lot of things into your inventory bar and have no idea if things are useful or not.  I would not mind if there was a different way to view or go through your inventory once it gets crowded.Overall:  I’d recommend this game to anyone who like puzzle games.  I originally got this after playing “The Room” series of games and also wanting to try escape rooms.  Once you get started, it’s hard to put down.	----->	7

124097845	*1.9 changed a lot of things so take any pre-Oct 19 reviews with a grain of salt.Organic city builder focused on the creative building of monuments. Totally worth it, but this can be a scary time sink if you're not careful.	----->	4

124134080	looks nice, i love the super zoom and the cartoonish graphics looks nice even when zoomed i'd say. nice work with territories. refreshing terrain & building placement (which causes villagers stuck; also you can build 2 buildings at the same place).tutorial mode got me stuck twice, had to quit as i've no money to progress and literally zero income with no possibility to earn a single buck per month another way. and can't build buildings. screw this mode.UI is great, tho map is missing. I hate control: can't right click to close mini windows, can't pan easily, Logitech mouse functions are not overwritten so gazzilion of mouse buttons can't be used. Modifiers like CTRL already used and conflicting. Can't middle click to pan. Can't right click to pan. I need to pan, not bounce screen corners like mad!! Wish the control was standard and productive.	----->	11

124157035	Ich kann das Spiel definitiv empfehlen selbst im Early Access ist es schon sehr interessant jedoch gibt es noch einige Probleme 1. Baumeister arbeiten viel zu kurz an Gebäuden sie bauen manchmal nur eine Sekunde dadurch dauert es bestimmt 15 min.(bei normaler Geschwindigkeit) bis das Gebäude fertig ist.2.Wenn Einwohner hungrig sind laufen sie nicht zum nächsten Marktstand sondern zu einem der eigentlich viel weiter weg ist.	----->	0

124237965	Honestly, this game isnt bad. I have build many towns and try to perfect them the best I can each time. And mods just make it 10 times better even though I still havent use many and I tend to build most cities in Vanilla. The devs are still pretty active and are releasing updates and the game justs get more interesting each time. The graphics arent bad either and you dont really need a fat pc to run it. I place this game on my laptop alot thats a 1050, bc its my traveling game and it stll runs well!Definitly would recommend if you love city builder games	----->	14

The economy system is hard on you when starting but once you unlock trade routes, your money problem goes away. Your buildings have add-ons so you can keep upgrading them no problem though the UI for doing this is kinda confusing.

124337419	Foundation is the first game from the Canadian Polymorph Games stage founded in 2016. The company was founded on the initiative of Philippe Dion and Leo Carnaut-Delord - developers who were one of the main creators of the 2014 Chariot platformer. The described production is a city builder set in the Middle Ages. The title combines elements known from various productions, including Anno, SimCity and Crusader Kings II. The gameplay is based on several pillars. The most important of them are the resources influencing the development of our city. For example, building it near a forest means that we have enough wood, which makes it much easier to build buildings made of this material or to set up farms. However, such a deposit may suffer from a lack of a more durable material, e.g. stone. Following the example of the Anno Foundation series, it enables the creation of complex production chains that drive the development of the city. At the beginning of the game, we have a handful of settlers to lay the foundations for the future city. Along with the development of agriculture and industry, we attract more residents to us, for whom we must provide shelter, food and work. Of course, you should always remember about the resources and money that are necessary to implement subsequent changes. The ultimate goal is to transform a settlement of a dozen or so people into a powerful, prosperous and protected medieval metropolis with a mighty castle, church, mansions, farmlands, mills, etc. The Foundation offers full support for modifications. Thanks to the provided tools, players can create new units, buildings, areas, and even additional missions, which they then share with other members of the community or use for their own purposes. Technical issues The Foundation for the PC platform is powered by the proprietary Hurricane engine, created with city builder strategies in mind. Composers who previously worked, among others, are responsible for the soundtrack. for Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV. A very nice game, lots of great mods, and quite addictive yet relaxed gameplay make it a perfect game for people who are creative and like strategy and planning.	----->	23

124522215	The secret agent Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been happily married with his wife, the legal secretary Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), for many years living in the suburbs and having a teenager daughter, Dana (Eliza Dushku). Helen does not suspect that Harry has a double life, and she believes he is a computer salesman. After a top-secret mission, Harry finds evidences that Helen is having an affair with Simon (Bill Paxton), an used cars salesman that seduced Helen with the glamour and excitement of his fake life, telling her that he is a spy. Harry forces his partner Albert Gibson (Tom Arnold) to use the resources of their agency to follow Simon and Helen; they abduct Helen wearing masks and later they assign a pseudo mission for her. However, a group of terrorists kidnap Helen and Harry and the couple gets involved with a dangerous group that possesses an atomic bomb ready to be exploded in Florida.	----->	-2

124588203	7/10Mixed feelings about this game. I've only played it solo, or working together with a friend sitting with me. Some of the puzzles aren't very intuitive (maybe I'm really stupid). I get this main idea of what I need to do, but it's not obvious how to do it. Also some puzzles need you to keep looking at different items and it can be frustrating, especially if you have a rubbish memory like me, to have to keep going back and forth. I literally had to get out a notebook to scribble things down to keep a track of it. It would be nice if you could look at a couple items at the same time, or have a virtual notepad to type relevant details down.The hint system; mixed bag. Unlike a real escape room, where you have someone monitoring you who can give you relevant clues based off of how far into the puzzle you are, Escape Simulator can't be quite as intuitive, so often you understand roughly what you have to do but often (for me) not how to execute it. The little pictures tend to follow a pattern of an image of the player reading relevant notes (done that), then some more diagrams of things I already understand or have done. That can make the game frustrating in a not fun way.It doesn't work exactly like a real escape room, but it has some of those elements. I don't want to be completely negative; there are interesting puzzles and things to do, though sometimes I wish the rooms were a little bigger, though given how bad I've been at some of them perhaps that would make it harder. If you're really into escape rooms and don't have the time/ability to gather your friends or family for a real escape room, this could be a fun diversion in the meantime.Overall, I like it more than it annoys me. Not much replay factor, but seems like they're adding DLC and the like to keep things from turning stale.	----->	14

124738959	A lot of good rooms and clever clues, amazing workshop rooms too. Can sometimes be a little glitchy but nothing that isn't fixed by restarting the game.	----->	9
124741144	The game is great, and I absolutely love it. However, the change made in 1.9, particularly to the market, where consuming food does not bring in any gold coins, make it way more difficult to expand your village. It's a little tedious and annoying to progress, which was much more quicker in version 1.8. Gold is so rare to come by if you're not active on Trading, having to rely on that single source in the beginning of the game kind of makes it annoying to play!This game is still, technically, in early access. So there are lot's of changes to come. I still recommend the game and am enjoying it a lot otherwise. I am recommending this game because there is still so much to come. Hopefully they can refine some of these systems, and deliver a solid product.	----->	8

124839450	This game a solid. I do with the updates were a little quicker, but they do update it unlike others. I hope we get a way to upgrade roads. A cart or bulk delivery service would be nice. I could go on and on about things that would help but overall this game is a good time killer.	----->	7

124853422	[b]Escape Simulator[/b] is an excellent virtual escape room experience. From the offset, it offers players numerous levels to play through either alone or with friends, as well as a pleasant level creator. Most puzzles aren’t overly tricky to solve, and each themed room manages to stay fresh as it doesn’t feel like any of the puzzles have been recycled. The solution to each room often allows for multiple puzzles to be worked on at once, ensuring your partner finds something productive to do simultaneously. The devs are constantly working on more content, and Steam Workshop support makes for a technically endless amount of additional bonus content as well.I had an insanely good time playing it with my partner in crime challenging ourselves to complete each level in less than 15 min while avoiding to use any hints and finding all tokens. [u]Pros[/u] + Charming and vibrant cartoony visual style+ Limited but lovely character customization+ Intuitive and challenging puzzles+ Supportive in-game hint system+ Endless custom levels [u]Cons[/u] - No mid-level save option - A couple of minor bugsThis is easily one of my favourite casual solo and co-op puzzle games available, and well worth picking up. It is cozy, cute and exceptionally fun with friends! 8/10	----->	26

124888942	Really good game if you like puzzle solving, there's not a time limit but there is a timing to see if you can beat it. The puzzles and rooms are extremely well made with minimal controls learning. Easy to grasp format that you can tell will be a great experience from the tutorial stage. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a game to pass time and have fun doing so. All in all, an amazing experience 10/10 would recommend!	----->	18

125002339	I can't get enough of this game. I love escape rooms and puzzles, but not always under pressure. Escape simulator lets you have it all. It has a timer, if you want to put a little extra pressure on yourself, OR, you can just completely ignore it. There are many different themed room areas, each with multiple rooms. There is also also plenty of DLC, like special holiday rooms for example. Highly recommended.	----->	3
125002437	Fun game so far. Needs a bit of fining tuning once you get a bit further on. Builders hit for only 1 swing then wander off. Not sure if buggy or maybe a management issue on my part.	----->	0

125061315	My thoughts for a city builder even though it looks cartoonish with funny looking people the mechanics of the people are different than those on other games they think on their own kinda and build where they need to live and get their own needs like water and food you just have to have all available, it really gives you the overseer feel to it you watch over from afar put things where you want it and where things be profitable and work well for your people. then you can watch everything grow.. everything has ups and downs and you work thru em great game great idea.	----->	13

125555384	I've been playing this game from some 2 years ago, the recent update made the game really difficult. I appreciate adding more difficulty and playable stuff to the game, but you need to consider whether it is feasible or not. Yes, I'm talking about the recent splendor change... After you achieve to a certain level, you can buy the decrease influence between kingdom, labor and clergy 50%, that makes the game reasonable. However, how about the start? When you have nothing, when everything in scarce, money, food, people... how are you supposed to balance the splendor and level up the technology tree when you have no decoration to level up splendor at all?? Without level up, how are you supposed to survive till the point you can buy that ... that edict to balance things out. Does it sound a bit ridiculously difficult? I think the game need to think more carefully how to balance things out. It's nearly impossible to level up splendor  when you have no decoration, and splendor is the key to level up your technology tree, do you see everything contradicts? I find flat chance to survive the early game without mod, and I'm sorry about this.	----->	4

125767363	Superb. If you love escape room puzzles, there is heaps of content to go at here, and nothing beats the satisfaction of the light-bulb moments. I tend to go solo and take as long as I like; I'm in a group that does real life escape rooms so get the pressured ones then. This is a great option to wind down after a busy week.	----->	2
125767441	Very nice escape room game	----->	2
125776468	This is a game I'd want to give a Maybe to. I think if you love escape rooms, this will appeal to you. I think this does what it set out to do and does it as well as it could. There are no problems with it. I just didn't find it engaging. It works fine, the puzzles that I did are a fair difficulty, but it just failed to grab me beyond that first 30-40 of novelty to see how this would work as a video game. I give it plenty of credit for standing out in its genre. I found it dull. Maybe it's just the lack of appeal of escape rooms in general for me adding bias. I checked Yes rather than No on the recommendation to account for that.	----->	-3

The access to mods in game is brilliant, I started with some mods, then went back and started again without many (decoration ones I kept) and the base games just as, if not more fun. Anyway in case you couldn't tell, I recommend it alot. It's super cute, super well thought out, and super chill.	----->	18

126017627	This is a very chill city builder in a lighthearted medieval setting.If you are worried more about the west wing's tower-and-hall layout of your mansion than the fact that your production line for bread is that bad that it is crippling your trade income then this game is probably the right choice for you.The focus lies on building a nice town, mansion, monastery and much more. Micromanagement, optimization and efficiency of your settlement is not necessary.There are tons of mods out there that already add additional content, too.Being a early access title this game got regular updates so far.[b]It has a gold-rating on ProtonDB and worked out-of-the box for me.[/b]I have nothing to complain about this game	----->	-4
126024077	A very engrossing game with good and easy controls that provides a wide range of challenges to think about and solve. While the included 'rooms' are excellent in their own right, I especially like the fact that community-made rooms are encouraged and supported by the game. The sheer number of available 'rooms' is staggering and allows for virtual infinite replayability. While good alone, I find it even more fun to play together online, since discussing the puzzles and helping each other brings a new entertaining aspect to an already great game. Finally, the developers are very active in making new 'official' content and helpful on their Discord server.	----->	30

126130630	Any game close to twisted metal is good for me and this game you can build whatever kind of car you want. Tons of choices	----->	5
126131468	Even though the game is still in development, it feels like a finished game. It's very relaxing to play, and everytime a new update comes along, which is very often, it brings along a lot of new challenges. This game has risen to one of my favorites in a relatively short time, and I'm looking forward to what they come up next. The moddable buildings make every city you make look unique, and asigning living space instead of simply plopping in houses yourself, make the game feel more dynamic, you feel like your city grows, evolves, which makes it all the more rewarding when everything is going well.I don't really have anything negative to say about it, it's not the greatest game I've ever played, but for what they advertise, you certainly get your moneys worth. If you like city building games in a medieval setting, I would recommend this game to you.	----->	13
126134339	Fun escape room game, has interesting and clever puzzles.Really satisfying to solve everything, restart, then speed run the room.Has decent replay value because of the community workshops, and it seems like the developers are adding more rooms over time.	----->	6
126143248	This game is really fun to play with friends. Its like a mini escape room but with less physical action and more clicking. And the devs update frequently to add new rooms you can try	----->	5

126265801	If you are a creative person, you will like this game. If you are a creative person with friends, you will love it.This game allows you to build your own escape rooms, and the room editor in this game is amazing. I miss some features and are eagerly waiting for more updates that will allow one to do more, but with creativity most things can be solved.Games that collaborate with the community will always be loved by the audience. Thanks to the community made maps there will always be new maps to try out.for 15$, it's a no brainer.	----->	9

126366605	It's a pretty solid video game experience of an escape room.  The first time through each room is usually a pretty good challenge.  Finding the tokens can add a little reason to stay in a room a bit longer.  The graphics and ambiance are quite nice.	----->	6

126394421	i would consider this game as a gateway drug into more escape room games.every map the developers add to this map is like a blessing from heaven and it's not like you're going to run out of maps anytime soon since the game has a workshop section as well.not many games have captivated me as much as this one.cheers!	----->	11

126408202	Really fun mini golf game, especially with friends and collision on.  Lots of good maps on the workshop means there is always a new course to play.	----->	5

126428750	The puzzles are entertaining, the difficulty is just right, and the help mechanism is very useful! I do a lot of escape rooms IRL and this one comes very close to the experience you'd get in a 3D escape room.	----->	0
126433081	Fun puzzle / escape room game with friends! The puzzles are not too difficult but certainly not easy either.

126542754	Can't wait to play this with other people!!It is quite challenging, which I find very fun, even though it shows that I am much more stupid than I hoped I was.It went as far as even making it a challenge to play a non-puzzle driven game afterwards, because my brain had to think too much outside the box, lol.	----->	-3

126551292	This game ended up being a lot bigger than I had originally thought. Spent over an hour on just one out of the 4 of the default maps with a couple of friends and there are workshop maps as well that'll give you a lot more playtime	----->	0

126614194	The base game is fantastic on its own with the normal escape rooms and the DLC rooms they offer, but the addition of workshop rooms, an intuitive editor, and hundreds of talented creators using it, you basically have a puzzle game with an infinite amount of content at your hands.	----->	3

The latest update kinda made buildings like the manor stop working like they did before, which was a little irritating, but the way the geometry works in the game allows you to work around it.Overall, the continuing updates are pretty good quality, and I look forward to seeing what's in store.	----->	9

126924043	Honestly, just a really great game. I love watching my citizens make their own paths, and go about their day. One thing I would have to say though is that it gets challenging after a certain point, as you have to constantly stay on top of trade, taxes and keeping the people happy, not to mention the rest of the factions.	----->	9
126927119	Perfect for playing it together with your brother! 5/5	----->	0
126927282	At its core Foundation is a very fun and organic city builder. I enjoy watching my village grow, designing monuments, and managing my economy. Fairly bug-free and they really just need to expand and refine the mechanics they already have in the game.The team behind the game seems passionate and understand their game, so I have faith they will deliver fully in the end.Good game, would recommend, Can't wait for the future.	----->	10

127115498	Possibly on of the most creative city building games i've played. Buildings are brilliantly custimisable and thanks to it not enforcing collisions the vanilla settings make customisation far easier and with more freedom than any other game. If you want to build buetiful medieval towns or even regions of small villages this is the game for you. If you want a hardcore town survival you'll be dissapointed	----->	6

127155675	Golf It! is a fun little game for any (mini) golfing fan for the PC. It can be janky at times but that honestly helps add to the fun of it. The courses range from incredibly easy to insane levels of difficulty. The customization features add a fun layer to the game and make replaying the game more important. The base game courses are great but do get boring after a while so the workshops support really comes in handy for this one. Some of my favorite courses I have played range from incredible builds that test your mini-golfing limits to this is literally just a Mario Kart map. This game also has VR support! That alone bumps it up a letter grade for me. Overall its a great fun little game to play, especially with friends or if you are a mini golf fanatic like myself.	----->	26

127192353	Really happy with this game! Me and my boyfriend have been playing together and between us we have not come across a room that is too easy. The rooms progressively get harder and there are time limits in order to gain the trophy for that room which is good incentive to figure it out as quickly as you can. Alongside this you can collect little tokens which are hidden in every room which makes for a fun extra game when you have completed a room. Again they have not made this too easy which makes it rewarding when you finally find them all. Overall the level progression is done really well, the difficulty steadily goes up and the game has repeatability due to the level editor - 10/10	----->	14

127234715	A very fun game. I really love that it has the rooms made by the developers but you can also download rooms made by other people! Personally, I think it's more fun with multiple people, but it's still enjoyable by yourself. It can be a little glitchy at times, but not anything bad enough to cause me to stop playing. All in all, I can definitely see myself finishing all the original rooms, as well as quite a few community rooms.	----->	7

127353371	[u]Positives:[/u]Game is a lot of fun, especially if you have friends to play with.[u]Negatives:[/u]Sadly the community is dead, you're lucky to find more than 10+ people online on public servers. The game has been in development for the past 10+ years (it was available as a beta before the Steam EA release) and there have been many improvements mostly with maps, graphics etc. but development seems to have stalled during the past few years. At the time of writing the last update was over 2 years ago.[u]Conclusion:[/u]Unless you have at least one friend who owns the game or is willing to buy it I can't recommend this game.	----->	3

127481367	Foundation is enjoyable & laid-back, with one big caveat.  The Help isn't very helpful.  At all.  I was stuck several times with no clue as to how to accomplish the mini-goal.  I would click everything I could find, with no success.  Finally by watching several play-through videos by Tolakram (on YouTube) I was able to find how to proceed.  It really should be easier, but... Early Access woes, I suppose.  Other than that, pretty good!One specific Help need was how to Promote a Novice in my Monastery.  I found the answer after about an hour of watching a YouTube play-through.  There were two other situations, and I will edit once I remember them (my short-term memory is poor).One I haven't found the answer to is how to attach a weather vane or chimney to the Manor House.  I've moved it to every place I can think of on the Manor House without success.	----->	0

127512275	There are few good escape room games. This is one of the few actual good ones: good controls, not overly-complex puzzles and good visuals. To top it all off, Pine Studio have been releasing new FREE rooms since the launch of this game. There is also DLC with a couple of new rooms. Lastly, there is a workshop where players can create their own rooms. These are, obviously, not the best rooms, but from time to time you will find a good one.	----->	19

127536535	As far as minigolf goes this is one of the wackier games.

127771403	I played this game on stream with a friend who was feeling unwell, thinking we could have some casual puzzle fun.Let me tell you, we had a blast! We played for almost 8 hours straight through the main game. The next day I bought the Steampunk DLC and we played through the entirety of that in one sitting. Some other friends joined into helping out with the puzzles and we all had a great time!The puzzles are clever, but not frustrating. Some of the more challenging ones gave us a real sense of accomplishment once we figured them out. We rarely beat the rooms within the time limit, but that is also because we took our time looking around the beautiful rooms and having fun with the many details hidden inside them.The controls are easy to grasp and you can adjust the key bindings to your own liking.It's a very charming game, from the little details that came back in multiple rooms to the victory dancing at the end. Overall, would definitely recommend to anyone who likes a good puzzle game.Looking forward to the next DLC!	----->	25

127834760	For a Settlers Geek this is a must have game, I like the fact that my Lordship do not have need to built houses and roads, just plan central buildings. Would need more trade partners and even more resources. Also there should be some effects over weather you choose Nun, Monk or Nun&Monk Monastiry, Pros and Cons.I did run out of names already, there should be a generator or opportunity to import more names from excel of CSV file.  Fisherman/woman rows without oars ;-)I recommend, so addictive to watch busy bees.	----->	4
127841005	The modularity of buildings and grid-less placement has ruined every other city builder for me. The management might not be as in depth as other games but you can get so creative with the layout and look of your villages/cities. Great mod support too.	----->	2

127884866	This game is very fun to play with your friends! It can be both challenging and easy at the same time. The community this game provides is amazing and they create incredible maps. I recommend playing this with friends and playing in a challenging map that someone has created. Have fun!!!	----->	11
127887950	This game sounds like a nice idea, and I wish the review system here was more than just yes or no, but that's what it is. As such I can't really recommend it as it's current iteration.Here's the problem. This is a game that wants to be 10-12 players, but it's only really interesting for 2 of them. Because of that, they made it two player only and filled the rest with bots. Problem solved right? Not really. This is a behavior simulator, and now one player isn't trying to behave like he's a normal every day person. He's trying to behave like he's a normal every day bot, because the bots can't do much better. It's unnatural, and doesn't really fit with the theme of the game.The problem is with the underlying premise of the game. If they could improve the game play for the other dozen or so innocent actors and give them something else to do, something else to accomplish, then maybe this game could have more than 2 players and feel much better than it is. Until then, it's not going to achieve anything near the level of intrigue of Town of Salem, or anything similar.I hope the developers take this to heart, and find some direction to improve this.	----->	23

127902737	You walk around, you look around, you pick things up, and you solve puzzles.The game looks, plays and feels incredibly simple, and that's all it needs to be. Don't worry, some of the puzzles will have you scratching your head for a few minutes trying to make sense of the clues you've gathered and how they fit together. The most rewarding part of this game is when it finally clicks and you have that eureka moment. So do yourself a favor and don't look up any guides, no matter how tempting.Finding those collectible coins is an exception ;)Grab this game, grab one or two of your clever friends and get potentially endless enjoyment out of this puzzle solving experience thanks to top notch base game and DLC levels, and an abundance of community maps.	----->	13

127929901	Golf It! is a multiplayer golf game that offers players a fun, casual golfing experience. The game's simple controls and variety of game modes make it easy to pick up and play, and its multiplayer mode allows players to compete against each other in friendly matches. Playing the game with other players is much more enjoyable than playing solo, as it adds a competitive element to the game. The game's well-designed courses and variety of obstacles also add to its replayability. Overall, Golf It! is a fun game that is best enjoyed with other players.	----->	10
127930443	Fantastic game, all the rooms are very well designed and a lot of fun! The main game lasts [i] maybe[/i] 10 hours (can't really recall) , but there is a dedicated community who have made hundreds of absolutely amazing rooms inside the inbuilt editor, which IMO is where this game REALLY shines. The creativity and ingenuity of rooms is wild, with everything from short horror games, escape rooms inspired by popular media, narrative focused experiences there is a huge amount of variety! There's been 1 steampunk themed DLC which was well worth the price at £5, plus several free holiday rooms released which have been top tier too! Genuinely awesome game, best with a friend IMO but I'm sure it's plenty enjoyable single player too :D	----->	25

127998213	A laid-back and very enjoyable resource management game that lets you build a settlement up from scratch. I'm really enjoying the decorative options I'm unlocking as play progresses and I have more resources to burn. A little glitchy with some of the graphics sometimes (like the stall tents in the market), and jerky with the villager animation up close, but these don't impede gameplay.	----->	0
127999502	Great coop game for puzzles. The wife and I love this game. It has tons of replayability in the community. The standard rooms, though, are pretty quick. And once you get to the community rooms, they make the standard rooms look dull.There have been a lot of very good creators coming out with wonderful rooms. Hopefully they will be hired on to create DLC. My only gripe is that I can't customize my character more. It seems like there should be a way to collect more clothing items.	----->	13

128170897	Been playing this game for about 3 years now and MAN this one came a long way! Love the organic growth of your city and with the new mapgenerator the game gets more and more replayability. The only downside is, that the game needs your creativity and your ability to set yourself goals because the given progression will only make you go through the same motions every game. So if you like to challenge yourself and be creative with your builds this game is just a must play! The devs are also super approchable and helpful. This is EA done right!  You really can see that there is a team that is really trying to interact with players. Also there is constant progression in development and very good communication from the devs. If you got a bug or problem or just want to give some idea or imput : go to their discord.	----->	10

128180016	Awesome concept. Especially the great support for creators is what makes this game so great. There is a lot of content for such a small price. The mechanics are easy to learn but the different environments and items add such a great variety of possibilities. I really recommend it to anyone who like Escape rooms and riddles.	----->	13
128182270	Cute Design, engaging themes, and a lot of puzzles that are not the same across every room. Sometimes you know what you need to solve but not how and other times you know what you are trying to work with but need the corresponding riddle. All puzzles feel 'in place' for whatever theme the room has. The ability to play workshop content also increases the amount of rooms playable to nigh infinite. On top of that there are dlc's that are being released at a reasonable price. So get this if you want a well rounded escape room simulator that feels like a story you might actually encounter and not a theme and puzzles thrown together. Would recommend based on real life escape room experience. (And having played the game of course)	----->	8

128213849	As a gamemaster for an actual escape room company, I'm always on the lookout for fun escape room games that I can play in my spare time. I really enjoy Escape Sim and have shared the game with everyone I know. I love that there are plenty of polished levels to choose from, and once you've completed all the ones that the game developers have made, there's plenty more to pick from that are made from fans of the game as well, and despite not being as professionally done as the ones from the main game, they're nothing to sneeze at! All the games are challenging enough that it keeps me and my teammates thinking, but not too challenging that it makes us feel unmotivated. Totally check this game out! It's a real blast, especially if you only have a half an hour and want to finish a quick game!	----->	9
128214769	good game for you if you like smacking your friend's balls.	----->	5
128221109	I think this game has a huge amount of potential, but at the moment the UI is so confusing and difficult to navigate. It took me a lot of googling to be able to finish some quests. Im not opposed to googling when I need a hint for a game, but as i progressed i found myself needing to do it more and more to actually be able to complete quests/tasks. I love the fact that it doesnt have a grid system though! i think thats awesome and will allow for really organic and realistic towns and cities!For now im going to pause playing, but ill definitely start a new save file in a few months after the UI is updated!Edit: I would also like it if there were POC villagers in the game	----->	8

128243620	Absolutely love this game. For me who is into real life escape room binging and have done 200+ real life escape rooms, it's an amazing thing to be able to create my own immersive puzzle universes with the games' room editor module. The many rooms that come with the game are of an unmatched quality. And there is a huge community of happy room builders (including myself) who enjoy creating high quality rooms.	----->	12
128244909	It's really good, it's a very chill and easy colony builder. I love how the world progresses around you, it feels really natural. Theres not much you can do in terms of designing your colony which I think is a bit sucky, but mods can always fill in the decoration gap if you really care about it.	----->	6

128250608	Fun and unique city builder. Learning how to manage your supplies while expanding can be challenging and rewarding.

128263968	The rooms it comes with are pretty fun and well designed.

There is just wayyyyy too much shit packed into those rooms and they are tiny and miss some of the fun puzzle spirit.	----->	10

128402316	Super fun and even better with friends. Its unfortunate that the game itself only has a handful of maps/rooms, but the player-made rooms certainly make up for it. In addition, I'm not a huge fan of each additional room (DLC) that comes out being an ADDITIONAL $5 rather than just being added to the game which already has a slim selection of included maps. Again, the community rooms definitely bridge that gap as far as replay-ability goes.	----->	10

128817785	If you look at my time played that basically tells the story. 90% of that was in the room editor. It's pretty addictive (for me at least) making your own rooms with such a robust editor, allowing basically any type of outside asset to be imported from custom models, textures, sounds and more.An easy $15 to spend. Great community support, constant updates. Thumbs up across the board.	----->	6

128867905	Surprisingly enjoyable right from the beginning as a 50+ year old player. The only issue I have with the developing game at this point is I would have liked for the game to have a tech 'tree' (not sure if this is the correct wording) in order to know how to progress to various levels. ie: in order to get tools, you need to fulfil other requirements and actually name those requirements as it gets very confusing during gameplay when you're trying to figure out how to get a tax office but already have a manor house yet unable to build another manor house for taxes etc... The game is missing direction on how to obtain various levels.	----->	0

128939720	If you are into puzzle games, I'd really suggest you to either play The Room series or Portal first since this game has a bit different mechanics that you may find challenging at start.I've finished the game with a friend who is quite a good thinker, or rather can analyse the situation differently compared to me. We were like 2 pieces of puzzle, since one of us would work on one part and the other one does the other part. I honestly believe that, this game should be experienced in coop.The most important part of such game is that community support, developers chose to give players the tools to create maps themselves and it really extends the life of the game. I hope to see many skilled players creating more wonderful puzzles.Interactive environment was quite interesting for me since I loved destroying stuff and putting them into trash. Compared to Escape Academy this game is more linear, rather than story focused. You just solve puzzles with no cherry on top. I've loved Escape Academy and this game is somewhat close in terms of puzzle variations.The bad&meh part, tokens.. you find them hidden somewhere. It is just a weird mechanic that I just didn't care at all, you don't really need to find them. Something of a completionist's stuff.	----->	19

128954708	Pretty nice city building game. Graphic is nice. Building has sufficient variety for long game play. Besides building, trading , logistic and satisfying village's need also add a lot of fun to the game.Something bad about the game:- estate penalty make it hard to unlock milestone for all estate- Monk and Solider cannot be released back to normal villager. - Mission easily get bored - Sometime don't know why the path is blocked	----->	-2

I think we only won a trophy in 2 or 3 of the main levels by beating the 15 minute time mark...lol. And then the added rooms are the same. We are getting hours and hours of play time with this game.

129118756	Great puzzle game to play with a friend/spouse/etc! I've gone through all of the base escape rooms + the Steampunk and Wild West DLCs and for the most part I thought the rooms were challenging but fair. There were only a few rooms in the Steampunk DLC that I felt required me to just make arbitrary guesses until it 'clicked'.This is the only first person game I have ever played that made me feel motion sick. If your head is spinning when you try it I recommend turning on the motion sickness options because they helped me.	----->	1
129122306	I really like this game. It gets you thinking about how to utilise what in the room! Plus I really like the bonus games of looking for the tokens, they add a bit of extra fun! My boyfriend and I quite often have date nights when we're not together playing these and working through the puzzles together =] The workshop content that people create are so good and I love what other creators have made! So inventive and no two workshops are the same which is great fun. Would definitely recommend!	----->	12

129241980	Love the game! Extremely relaxing to play and the whole gridless idea feels great for the genre. Aside from a very few needed QoL changes, the only thing it's missing is day/night cycle and changing seasons to get a 10/10 in my opinion.Also the map generation added in the last update is great. They gotta give us the option to change the generation parameters, but I believe they said they're already working on it.	----->	1

129369300	** This is after completing the Egypt rooms and some space ones. **The game *really* feels like true escape rooms~. Only downside so far as I've seen, is that you don't get to complete one room to be able to go into another room that you also have to solve to then eventually escape. It is literally just 'one room' all the puzzles are in. BUT, some rooms actually let you interact from afar outside the room you are in- like an Egyptian level with vast land around you- that makes it feel more expansive and interactive beyond the bounding room.Puzzle will get hard. Only in level 3 or 4 of the Space themed ones did my mom and I end up getting stuck in for maybe an *hour*. It actually dealt with 'science'- molecules to be specific. I felt like I should have paid more attention in school because of that level lol. We were sooo stumped; and we were determined to never use hints. We didn't use hints still no, and eventually she figured out, but I would have never solved it myself.On that note: Def more fun and better with a person or two, even if it's a touch chaotic cause the room is really small/compact/clastrophobic.Added Pro: Other people can make rooms and share them, like a level maker. Like some other games, people can make their own rooms and post to public for them to play. - This means aside from the 'main story' ones (not really stories), there is still many more rooms you can try and play because of community~. So you aren't just paying for one game that you play once and never come back to- because the rooms do not randomize the puzzles. I have confidence there are some good community ones~. There are smart people out there!Cons: Some controls make me confused and get finger twistered. Some buttons do the same thing as another button, so you might accidentally hit that button or a dif one and does something you didn't want to be done making items appear on screen, then drop, or go to bag, and lkasjdf.Some Puzzles are easy to complete with 'trial and error' tries, that would mean not needing an object that would have solved it: BUT, most the puzzles still have alot to do and solve that are harder in the same level~.	----->	20

129405450	I love escape room type games and this is the best one out there. I love the fact that this game is endless as long as the community keeps adding to it, so it's not really dependent on the Developer.

I think is one game that will I will be able to play until I get tired of the genre...no time soon.	----->	5

129592339	As the title suggests, Escape Simulator is about escaping a room. In order to do that, you have to solve a series of puzzles by yourself, or with friends. The puzzles are fun, logical, and there's even a hint button in every room, giving you a small nudge in the right direction if you're stuck. There are collectibles, or even a time limit if you're looking for more challenges. With steam workshop, and community made maps, there's always more rooms to play. Definitely recommended, even more fun with a partner!	----->	4
129595677	One of my favourite city builder games, love how beautiful and organic the development feels as opposed to being stuck on a grid, and if you are a bit OCD like me just block out zones so it develops the way you want.great work devs!	----->	5

Each theme contains several rooms to escape in, and each of them extremely creatively made, with wondrous logical puzzles. Some of them even offer inferred mini stories. Worth every penny + time spent in the game, both with friends (more fun) and alone.	----->	-1

129673961	Foundation is the best Early Access title I've ever bought. I've put 112 hours into it and I normally consider an hour per dollar spent a good return on investment. This game can be as chill or as challenging as you want it to be, and that's just in vanilla. I have been waiting to try the mods until after I had unlocked every achievement, so I'll be doing that next.The graphics and gameplay are fun. This is a great city builder with an emphasis on logistics. It is important to make things accessible to your villagers and liberally dot markets, wells, and supply storage around the map. You can focus on farming and labor, military, or clergy routes or do all the three at the same time if you wish. There are really no permanent maluses for doing so, which is nice. If you're achievement hunting, you can lock yourself out of doing some in a single playthrough if you aren't careful. With that being said, the game is worth multiple tries as you continue to learn the mechanics and improve.I've also never encountered any gamebreaking bugs or really any bugs at all for that matter. Anything I got frustrated with was just because I misunderstood, forgot something, or it wasn't explained well enough in-game. I look forward to seeing this game progress further in 2023 and toward its final release date. Highly recommended.	----->	13

129796759	I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.Thank you <3	----->	6

129877119	What an amazing game! If you love solving puzzles and real-life escape room games then this is the thing for you. Just the right amount of challenging vs being able to solve clues and move forwards. Each room is taking me about 27 minutes to solve alone, and considering there 4 per theme (space, Egypt, mansion etc.) that's a great amount of hours spent on this game. Very good value for money. I've clocked up 8 hours already and still have at least 8 rooms to solve! All the puzzles are logical and fair.  But when you get stuck there is a nifty and unobtrusive hint system. Although I've found that if I keep searching the room I can work out the answers by myself eventually. Buying the DLC add-ons now!	----->	15

129928399	I and my friends were a little late to the Escape Room trend but once we started we couldn't get enough. There are a lot of rooms near us and in less than a 1-hour drive but it's tough to synchronize our schedules to find more than 1 slot a month to play. We needed a faster, easier method to play some cooperative puzzles and that's how we found Escape Simulator!It's a bit different feeling than analog rooms but it's close enough. Puzzles are diverse - based on locks, ciphers, puzzle boxes, etc. as well as electronic devices, physical/chemical/biological experiments, and old-school items breaking with a hammer. Rooms made by devs follow certain schema but it's not repetitive nor boring - you learn new tricks in almost every scenario. In general, we enjoy this game, and are coming back to it now and then to calm down the urge to go to a real-life Escape Room when we can't find enough free time or money :D[u]PROS:[/u]- pretty - this game looks really lovely. Cartoon graphics makes everything very readable and sharp so it's pretty hard to not notice important puzzles- very creative puzzles - even though there are a lot of locks in almost all dev rooms you don't get bored with them because it's always a different way to get the combination. Secrets are in general nicely hidden sometimes even in plain sight, you don't get too much headache over them but get that nice rush of satisfaction after figuring them out.- good implementation of clues - I wouldn't say rooms are linear. Multiple puzzles are available from the start and I don't think we had to start with a particular one even once. What we found more challenging was to divide them between ourselves. This is also not your typical Point'n'Click game when you have to combine items 'till they work. Most clues are simple but specific, you can easily figure out where to use them. Some clues are maybe too guiding but for good reason (why would anyone write a vague book?). When you are stuck you can always use a hint button and those clues are very nicely done (we used them maybe 3 times across all rooms available in the base game and both DLCs).- cool design - rooms have themes and they are designed very well. Music fits nicely, sounds are immersive, and items scattered around are just enough distracting.- workshop support - community rooms vary in quality but the best ones made our jaws drop. It's marvelous what people can make with the in-game level editor and we are actively waiting for the next rooms of our favorite creators. - controls - those are fine. You can pin items to your view, wear certain objects, and take a look at what your buddy is doing. The only thing that bugged me a little was the unintuitive way of picking up items but I got used to it.[u]CONS:[/u]- some bugs - it's not bad but some stuff happened. Once the script didn't start at all  - we still could finish the room by brute force (but we didn't) but we couldn't access certain mechanics and clues. In the other room, one puzzle glitched and was unsolvable. For both cases, the game restart helped. I think if you are not trying to fight with this game the chance of getting bugs or glitches is low.- no VR support - this game would be so good in VR. I get that it's probably way too hard to implement it satisfyingly but still - I wish I could play it with goggles.- the number of people playing matters a lot - the first couple of rooms didn't have enough puzzles to share between 4 people and we still had this issue from time to time later on. Sometimes 4 people trying to solve 4 puzzles generate too much chaos, other times 4 people are working on a single puzzle and struggle to communicate effectively. We played token hunting when someone didn't have any input. Some rooms are almost claustrophobic when played as 4 player team. In general - worth the price, worth the time, worth the fun :)	----->	38

129981790	The puzzles are a lot of fun and I appreciate that they don't ask you to use any outside knowledge to solve them. It's a great game to play solo or with buddies, and I imagine it's very similar to how it would feel to do an escape room in person (which I can't normally do because of my claustrophobia). The hardest part is finding all the tokens, and sometimes those blend in a little too well into the background.	----->	9
129983536	Only been playing this a little while but it is a hell of a lot of fun for anyone who enjoys escape rooms.For some reason it does have some Unity crashes, which I still haven't solved, but that doesn't take away from how good it is.	----->	4

The game closely mimics the experience of being in an escape room with your friends without having to be physically together and spend $30-40 per escape room. The control and game mechanics are easy to learn and puzzles are challenging without being impossible to solve. We played for 3.6 hours and got through most of the official content. Will try the community made content tomorrow but even with how much fun I've already had with this game I think it is definitely worth the cost.	----->	8

130102233	Thumbs up if you want a casual relaxing medieval city builder without conflict or major disasters.Bought it yesterday and put 7 hours into it so far. I like the organic looking villages you create, you put down the production buildings and the NPC's create the natural looking paths by walking repeatedly over the land. The NPC's also place their own housing in areas you designate. They don't always do a great job of placing them naturally, but it is good enough.Only downsides are the tutorial which is ok, explains some things well, but others just leave you perplexed when you try to put it into practice. The economy and morale systems are confusing, sometimes I have a bunch of money, sometimes I am broke, I have no I idea what I did right or wrong in each case. The UI leaves a lot to be desired, it needs a lot of clicking around, randomly selecting stuff to see if that fixes the issue you might be having.It is a mostly pleasant experience to play, though still feels early access in the tutorial and UI which can make parts frustrating. The game price is a bit on the steep side for what it is IMO, even with 20% off sale price. It feels like games that are normally £16 rather than £25, It is a decent game, but not worth enough to be priced as a premium indie game.Update: After putting in more time, I have come to realise how lacking in depth the game is, each play through will be basically the same, just vary in how you lay things out on different maps to your tastes. It is quite cathartic to play, but don't expect to have to engage your grey matter much.	----->	10
130109855	I'm sorry but this game in no way is worth $25 and I never see this game go on sale, so I'd imagine the makers are some kind of delusional. It's really good, but maybe The Ship: Murder Party $10 good.	----->	2

This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.	----->	9
130166872	If you and a friend are interested in this game, I would absolutely recommend. The gameplay is only ever as challenging as your opponent's skill level, and it has near infinite replay value. There are only 2 downsides. Firstly, you really need to know someone else who also plays this game to be able to play most of the time. There are online matches available, but very few people are online at any given time. Secondly, the price really is a bit much considering that you really do need to convince another friend to play with you in order to enjoy the game regularly. I could see $15, but $25 is a lot when you're going to need a second copy of the game. But if you do have a friend or partner who's ready to get the game with you, I'm sure you'll have a great time! One tip, look up tournament matches on youtube if you wanna learn how to get really, really good!	----->	8
130168318	If you're looking for a golf game to play with friends then this is not the one. After playing Golf With Friends, this game has too many flaws which make it fun and left me wanting to play the game again with friends. The shot mechanic and the ability to change clubs is okay but it lacks in all other areas. If you have friends to play with, its a good game to play because its a bad game which will provide laughs for the entire family. in saying that, if you are an American, it's best you do not play this at all because its likely you do not have friends#FreePalestine #AlwaysMacedoniaNeverNorth #BLM = Buy Large Mansions	----->	10

130223508	Impressive city-builder. It's laid back, but deeper than most of the others I've played. It does require considerable thought to manage the relationship with the 3 Estates- Labor, Kingdom and Clergy. This balancing is key to unlocking new buildings and features.I started playing after the major 1.9 update, So I don't know what it was like previously. It is Early Access but updates are frequent, several in the 2 months since 1.9. As it sits the game is fully playable with no obvious bugs at all. It's early access, but I have received my money's worth.	----->	1

130237339	This is a great game for people that want to do escape rooms, without actually having to go to one and deal with people and claustrophobic environments. With that said, I'm 3 hours into the game, and all the rooms have just been existing inside a single small room, and puzzling my way out of it. I wish the rooms were at least a little bit more roomy or complex.	----->	4

There are definitely still a few puzzles which whilst they're solvable, they aren't very fun to solve so that's definitely something which could be improved. There's also not a ton of official rooms but there are an endless amount of community made rooms which definitely makes up for it! The only major negative I have for the game is connectivity issues which happens occasionally. Overall very worth the price!	----->	7

130541946	I have had this game on my wish list for like a year at this point. I have always been hesitant about getting this game even while on sale just because I thought it was just gonna be an eh game. I final got it and quickly realized its been a city builder that I have been wanting to play and have been searching for for a while now. It is more complex than what I thought it would be like which is something I look for in city builder games. There is a lot of comments/reviews talking about how relaxing and chill the game is which I completely agree with but due to those same comments, I figured maybe the game just ran itself. Definitely not the case though. It is chill and relaxing but still a lot of management going on as well as tons of other things. Anyways, super awesome game, infinite replayability and longevity to this one compared to some others.	----->	11

Controller support would be nice, I have an Shield TV with steam link and cannot play on the TV using my controller, also local multiplayer would be nice, my kids like playing with me, we already beat all of escape academy on PS5, but having to buy three copies of the game to just play with my kids just does not make financial sense to me.  With that said, the community rooms have been great, a couple I have tried have had errors , but still playable, it was almost like a secondary puzzle trying to figure out what they actually meant.  I would highly recommend.	----->	6

130790173	I have 347 hours on this game, so that should be a good indicator that it's an awesome game to play. This game is rock solid stable from beginning to end, I even had over 1,000 towns-people by the time I got tired and it still was great. The game guides you through the basics of game-play well enough to play on your own after the 'Tour' is over. The graphics are far from being dull and mono-toned and the characters are cute. I highly recommend Foundation as it is among my top ten games to play. 5 Stars all around. If you want to expand on it, check out the modding community as there are lots of 'upgrades' or game-play enhancements to try out.	----->	13
130794247	It's a great game if you like city-builder's.  Each path provides its own challenges.  I'm still learning and haven't googled build-orders, but that takes the fun out of it.   The arc of this game is amazing, and its more immersive than City Skylines.	----->	9

130894808	Foundation is a fun Medieval city builder with pretty graphics and little hand-holding for the player. It's easy to get started and create a cute little village. Four years after release the game is still in early access, which seems typical for a lot of games nowadays. There are also still a fair number of bugs, one of which (not being able to obtain certain resources via gathering or trading) can ruin the town you put so much time and effort in. Luckily the game allows for mods and the community have added a lot of extras for this game.	----->	9

130928341	I've put far too much time into this game. It's better than a lot of other traditional mini golf games. You can have courses that play as a regular 18H golf course, or insane 100H mini golf courses. The sky's the limit with creativity, and the hits feel solid. Highly recommend for a chill experience, as well as a high octane rush.	----->	2

130971649	Super fun and relaxing city builder. The gridless system and control npcs have on making natural paths and building homes is charming and fun to watch. It will take a few tries to figure out how to lay out a town but it's also hard to mess anything up too badly. You can also somewhat control where houses are built and paths are made once you get the hang of the tools and work placements. There is a lot to do in this game even in early access, but so much potential for more. I wouldn't expect to see full release for a couple years from now at least. Even with full release I have a feeling this game will be added to for years to come. If you want more now, there is full mod support and an active community, though I haven't looked into this myself yet beyond taking a glance.	----->	14

131118791	The content for the game is worth the money alone, add in the workshop rooms and this game is STEAL. Endless hours, always a new room to do, and a great community on Discord. Fun to play with friends or a partner too! I would suggest adding a feature to join someone mid-room as sometimes disconnects do happen, overall I would recommend.	----->	6
131137796	A polished, well-executed escape room simulator that is fun and infuriating in equal measure: Just like a real escape room!Affordable, high-quality DLC added to lots of community content means this is very replayable. Even better with a friend.My only criticism is that some of the puzzles are unreasonably vague, bordering on impossible. But maybe I'm just dumb.	----->	2

131236700	I really like this game and the concept is great. I bought it to play with my sister and we had a great time! I did try yo play a community room and there was a bug that certain object that were necessary couldn't be pick up and the only option was the restart the room. That part kinda suck and I lost all the progress I made in the room and certain puzzle I didn't remembered the exact solution, I don't know whose fault is that or what happened, and since it was just one room I won't be too annoyed, I still recommend this game. Also, the steam deck control take a time to get use to and you need to tweak them a little bit in my opinion or details work will be hard achieved (My sister on her computer would do them since it's easier with a mouse)	----->	4

131391545	Don't get me wrong this is a alright game, but it does need work. Re;eased in 2018, and still in early access beta? That was what? 6 years ago. I'd like to see changes made,  For instance, make it wo where people in the party dont freak out when you eliminate a target, b/c while it just be me, I have had no luck in doing that yet. Make the levels bigger with more options to be the spy master. Also, like in the game James Bond Nightfire,  you can take pictures of the potential spies in the game, as in this game, you have a list of people at the bottom of your screen,  etc. As said, this game is an alright game, and maybe the developers of games see reviews here on steam, and of they do, heres hoping the take some thoughts of working on this game more, b/c I do see potential here, just not quite yet. Anyways, thanks for reading. I am giving this game a thumbs down for the time being b/c of  my aforementioned thoughts.	----->	8

131455972	In the morning if my face is a little puffy, I’ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1,000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask, which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturiser, then an anti-ageing eye balm followed by a final moisturising protective lotion.	----->	-2

131666450	One of the most calming and joyful city-builders out there.What makes foundation really stand out is it's modular building system. Dedicated buildings such as mansions and churches can be built by you using a set of building block pieces. But villagers build their houses themself in zoned areas as well as creating roads where they walk that further adds to a nice dynamic feel as your hamlet grows to a little city.1.9 also added a nice building unlock system where you get a steady feel of progress as your settlement grows	----->	12

It has more than enough in EA, to make it a really solid and fun game. It is also cute, which I like. There is love to it, why I hope the developers read there reviews. It is nice to see. I am a Rimworld, Project Zombid fan, getting me away from such games, is rare, yet I have played nothing but this, since I got it.

131781936	its a great game, thats been in progress for a log time, however it has some great potential and i look forward to seeing the future of this game! hopefully they will add some mild combat or invasion system, who knows, but the devs seem passionate and the modding is easy and lively, with maps, animals, decorations, and unique buildings added by modders you have a lot of creative freedom, which always makes for a fun game. TLDR 7/10 pre-release game. slow but quality development great core game and simple in-game modding makes for and a fun replayable experience. worth the price with or without sale.	----->	27

132013936	Really nice co-op game with a very cute graphic style and good puzzles to scratch your brain to, be it alone or with someone (tho playing with someone offers you another point of view to help solve the puzzles, which you'll definitely need in this game). The playtime is overall quite long, with different themes, each offering a variety of rooms, which is good for a game of this price range. Added to that, a very good point are the community rooms, which add a lot of replayability to this game and even more fun puzzles.The only downsides are that some of the physics are easily broken (I'm thinking of the paintings, some key items interacting with the decor and hung objects like flowerpots) and that sometimes the cooperation invites via Steam tend to be a bit buggy, but nothing too annoying if you persevere.	----->	18

132098311	[h1]Fantastic peaceful city builder.[/h1]Foundations charm comes from it's simplicity but the ability to build complex sets with the monument feature gives me the same sense of building exploration I had with early Minecraft.The game advertises itself as laid-back and it delivers. There isn't a real rush to do anything and you are free to view and plan your growing city at your own pace. Resources are plentiful and infinite so deleting older parts of you city and rebuilding as you learn new techniques or unlock new buildings isn't a pain.Apart from setting zones you have no control of paths and villager housing, which gives the cities a natural and fluid feel.The soundtrack is fitting to the style of the game and it's not annoying.The community on Reddit and Discord are friendly and helpful and there is a small but active modding community. Mods are fully supported in game. Some mods are simple resource tweaks while others add whole new buildings that have their own jobs tied to them.I paid less than the cost of 2 movie tickets and certainly got more value out of it. Well worth the price as is. If you like the Anno series of games then you should like this game.	----->	23

132244688	The escape room craze has grown over the last decade, as a concept it’s interesting, players are locked in a room and solve a variety of puzzles leading to the ability to get out of the location.  Escape games also have been around and were created around the same time as the Escape Room idea, so Escape Simulator isn’t a new idea, however, it’s an attempt to get on that same craze.Escape Simulator has the player choose an Escape Room from a list of 25 levels, included within are four sets of five levels in a themed chapter, but each room can be approached in any order. From there, players are given fifteen or more minutes to solve all the puzzles in the room and escape them. After fifteen minutes though, luckily the game doesn’t stop but lets players escape however long it takes.  The fifteen minutes is the time to be awarded a “Trophy” for a set of achievements, conceptually an interesting idea, but having a major flaw in that after a player solves a single room, they can usually re-run that escape in a fraction of the time, since most of the puzzles have been solved.That’s ultimately the biggest issue that Escape Simulator runs into, escape rooms or Escape games only work a single time.  The experience has to be magical for the players because after the puzzles are solved and players leave the room, there’s no reason to return.  The good news with Escape Simulator is there’s the ability for fans to upload their levels, but ultimately players will be at the mercy of the other designers. As for the core levels of Escape Simulator, every level feels both unique and interesting, and I spent at least 5 hours enjoying the game.  When a level is tuned just right, the experience feels amazing, but there are at least two or three puzzles that I’m not sure how to solve. Inside the game, there’s the ability to press a button and get a “hint” with that button then give a new hint after each press.  This is the best way to handle these puzzles so players don’t get spoiled by guides, however, those two or three puzzles I mentioned were ones where after all the hints were given I still have no clue the direction the game wanted me to go without the external guides' assistance.  That’s always going to be a problem and with each puzzle only having one path to the solution, if a player misses a logical leap it leaves them needing to go to a guide to get the solution, and Escape Simulator does have a decent number of those leaps at times.Similarly, there are 8 hidden tokens to find per level, which only grants an additional achievement per set of levels.  Many of these are well hidden and will be things people will notice as they play through a level, but again this is something a guide is going to be useful for unless players want to examine every texture and location in a game.  In addition, there’s also a co-op mode, which makes sense as Escape Rooms are intended to be played by multiple people, but I feel like co-op would weaken the experience here because, for each player, there’s a 50 percent chance of solving a specific puzzle, a second person might help for when players get stuck, but for the most part, the desire would be to increase the experience for the player, not skip half of it while working with another person.  For a large escape room, more players are necessary because there’s too much to do, but Escape Simulator never reaches that scale or necessity.If you’re a fan of puzzles, Escape Simulator is a good time.  There’s a lot of variety in the puzzles and well-designed locations, but after finishing the game, I have an issue, there’s only a handful of puzzles that stood out, and I believe that’s because there are limited tools for designing the level.  Last year I played Escape Academy which is a story-based game focused on Escape Rules.  Academy had only 13 levels, half the number in Escape Simulator, but when looking at both games, Escape Simulator didn’t stand out as much.  Escape Academy was a more impressive game, due to its variety and how every level stood out as a unique experience.  Many of those rooms were unique in that a real escape room wouldn’t be able to do the same things in the real world.  In Escape Simulator, every room feels like players are once again in a room of the same size and shape, and while the puzzles are unique, the grandiose feeling of solving a once-in-a-lifetime escape room is missing, and that’s really what Escape Simulator could have provided.  The feeling of solving an escape room that would be impossible to do in real life. 7/10	----->	46

132253310	This game is perfect for watching or listening to something else. I use it to play while watching ALGS or other ESPORTS on the other screen. It does eventually get more involved as your town gets bigger, but at 1x speed, it's still a second screen game. can't recommend it enough!	----->	5

The available mods are awesome and the community is also a great experience. I am looking forward to the finished product which I am certain the devs will have out as promised.

First of all the graphics are therapeutic and beautiful, 99% of the animations are smooth and well made, the gameplay is awesome, the tutorial isn't invasive, it is just challenging enough to be virtually impossible to put down. I absolutely love it. I hope that the sheep will get a bit more work done on them and I would love to see trees actually fall over when cut down but those are the only things I can think of to fault this amazing game.	----->	15

Being able to make your own room and play rooms other creators have made allows for endless game play.I'd say the downsides to this game include not being able to play certain rooms that have DLC items in them if you don't own the DLC package they're from. Also, the room maker mode should be made more user friendly and they should provide better instructions on how to build them.	----->	6

133241827	If you like City builders youll love Foundation. I continue to come back to this game for so many reasons, One of my most recent favorite reasons to play was to assist me with the way Functional towns would look in my D&D table top game, I wanted to create towns that made sense and that would actually have whats needed to survive and this game is a fun arcade way of doing so. Foundation has just about everything I wanted out of a city builder outside of Combat and even has a hint of that put in by sending troops to the king and seeing the after action reports. With the assistance of the mod community however you can find a mod for just about anything and everything the base game doesnt provide Highly recommend!	----->	13

133255922	A pleasing city builder with all the rough edges one would expect of an early access title.  After 40+ hours, I can say that the new updates improve the overall economy to a more manageable system.  I have experienced no problems with crashes, save file corruption (I have one out of date settlement that is not compatible with the latest version, but can still access it), nor indeed any of the issues that seem to form the bulk of complaints about the game.After some 35 hours of playing vanilla, I installed the housing mod as this seems to be the vanilla games greatest weakness, although that said - I have only needed to use it sparingly.Ryzen 7 5800X (unlocked but using boost only)Red Devil Radeon RX 6700XT (overclock bios)32GB RAM @ 3600MT/s (DOCP bios)	----->	5

I love the ability to custom create beautiful buildings with extras and add-ons you unlock as you progress. graphics and very clean, and art style is very lovely and well done. ive noticed that your people wont move to a closer house or build a new house closer to work once they get promoted. i think it would be an excellent feature to have self relocating towns folk.	----->	15

133273947	I can't believe I've already played this game for 11 hours and I haven't even played half of the rooms yet. each room is a well composed system of puzzles and mechanisms that makes for a very satisfying escape room experience. It has a pretty comprehensive level editor which I'd like to try out at some point and a slew of player made rooms for you to play, once you've finished all the main levels. There are also more free rooms in development, which i am looking forward to playing once they come out. One thing i will say is that it does stick pretty hard to the escape room formula, in that the end goal of every room is the exact same: to open a door to escape. Considering the freedoms afforded by this being a video game, I think there could be some more variety in what the goal is (stealing a gem, pressing a button before the room explodes, etc...), but its a pretty minor gripe. Another thing is that you shouldn't be expecting too much of a story experience, since the story and setting just serve as a backdrop to the puzzles. Overall, this is a very fun escape room game. Would recommend.	----->	8

133314105	Best escape rooms style game my girlfriend and I have found.  The levels the developers made offer a good mix of different types of puzzles that different people will naturally be better at.  For example, I'm great at anything involving numbers and brute force logic, but my partner is way better at dealing with anything more abstract, and I feel we each get our time to show off to each other.  I feel like I got more than my money's worth buying two copies for us, especially considering how much actual escape rooms cost.  Plus, there are a seemingly endless amount of user generated levels. Granted, only a fraction of those are any good, but there are monthly curated lists if you only want to play the most recommended.	----->	13

133390475	excellent game10/10takes a bit to learn everything, tons of content and so many different paths in the game to explore and enjoy. This is a game that you can sit with for hours, or u could walk away from while making dinner. a really cool, visually enjoyable game.built in MOD options which have an extremely easy interface to use (somebody who has never used mods in any game would have little to no issues figuring this aspect out) obviously using mods can enhance the game a million times over so this just allows for even more content.i have put over 100 hours into this game, some things are hard to figure out right away, and keeping balance can be tricky to sort out, but once you understand the game mechanics it is so much fun to find the balance in your kingdom. Highly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys city building games. however i must say this isn't Just a city builder. its much much more. 30$ (roughly) seems a bit steep for a game your not sure about. especially when u already own a lot of games u know u enjoy, but i guarantee you wont be disappointed in this game!	----->	9

Take your time building your own bustling little medieval town, with freeform placement of buildings and a good variety of buildings and resources.The biggest things lacking is the endgame, once you get far enough there is not much to do and remodeling your town is a pain. Still, a relaxing game worth its price!	----->	5

133638957	An excellent online co-op game; it is priced well that you can potentially purchase the base game for a friend in order to entice them to play alongside you. Online co-op connection has been stable with no disconnections! The game itself has slightly clunky mechanics; its not really frustrating and often lends itself to some funny moments when you accidentally smash a vase, or throw a painting across the room. The puzzles have been varied, interesting with some great 'Ah hah!' moments and have been challenging. The time limit is a little stressful, but there's no particular consequence if you go over on time. I know Escape Rooms have this added challenge IRL, but I do like figuring out puzzles at my own pace!All in all, I haven't come across that many online co-op games that are this easy to pick up and play. I look forward to playing this with my friend every weekend - a definite buy for you and some friends :)	----->	10
133640820	can't i just thumbs up a game without having to come up with something interesting or unique to say about it? I am enjoying it.  It's great!	----->	4
133641491	I love escape rooms IRL, so I was very excited for this game. Started off playing with my wife and we both had a blast once we figured out the mechanics of the game. It's simple enough, but very satisfying. We didn't beat the timer on the first few levels, but once we got the hang of it, we managed to clear a lot of levels within the timeframe. It's nice to not get kicked out of the room when the timer is done, like you do sometimes in real escape rooms. We didn't use any hints and just let the timer run out if we needed to. Having the tokens to find in the rooms was a nice touch as well.I typically play with a higher FOV than default in most games, so I adjusted my FOV accordingly. I recommend not doing this, as it looks quite weird. The 3D nature of the game is already not the best, so you don't want to mess with it. It's forgivable for what the game is.The game has a large community fan-base which designs levels that you can play. Many are quite good, and some are very hard. I also made a few levels for my wife as gifts and it was awesome to see her enjoy something I crafted just for her! The toolkit for design is quite powerful, and you can do a lot with it. I look forward to future developments to this portion of the game.This game is probably fun on it's own, but I'd imagine it's more fun with at least one other person. I'd highly recommend it at full price; it's honestly worth more. If it's on sale, it's a no-brainer. I typically don't review games until I'm done with them, but this game continues to offer DLC for purchase, so I decided I needed to go ahead and just review it. I'm also really happy that they've released a few free rooms since launch. It's nice to see a dev support a game with both free and paid content as time goes on, and when there isn't any, the community rooms are great. We will be playing this game for years to come I'm sure.	----->	42
133646983	The greatest strength of this game is also it's greatest weakness it's just a collection of well put together escape rooms. with many workshop made rooms to keep you going after the main game. if that sounds fun then your good to go but just be aware there is is nothing but the rooms, no side story, no real progression or any sort of gaming gimmicks to support it. within minutes of boting up you are just dropped in a room and solve them. every room feels unique with it's own idea but just know there is no cut scenes nothing just a basic menu to pick a room and go. I think it's still very much worth it and I had a blast with it and will continue to grab community rooms as they come up it was just jarring how little set up there is. I guess it didn't need it.	----->	13

133708975	Foundation is an excellent city-building simulation game that offers a unique and immersive experience of managing a medieval town. The game has stunning graphics and an impressive attention to detail that really brings the world to life. From the winding dirt roads to the bustling marketplace, every aspect of the game has been designed with care and precision.One of the standout features of Foundation is the sandbox-style gameplay. You start with a small settlement and have to grow it into a bustling town through careful planning and management. You have complete control over every aspect of your town, from the placement of buildings to the allocation of resources. This level of control allows for endless customization and replayability.The game also has a robust trading system that adds a layer of complexity and strategy to the gameplay. You can buy and sell goods with other cities and towns, which is essential for expanding your economy and acquiring rare resources. This system is well-balanced and realistic, making it an integral part of the game experience.Another aspect of Foundation that I appreciate is the attention to historical accuracy. The game is set in medieval Europe, and the buildings, resources, and technologies are all based on real-world counterparts. This not only adds to the immersion but also provides an educational aspect to the game.Overall, Foundation is an outstanding game that provides hours of fun and entertainment. The game is challenging yet rewarding, and it offers a great sense of accomplishment when you successfully grow your town. If you're a fan of city-building simulation games, then Foundation is a must-play. I highly recommend it!	----->	33
133711005	I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.	----->	9

133740933	A fun escape room game at a fun and casual difficulty level for two people. I strongly recommend doing this in co-op as the team dynamic in escape rooms is half the fun. It's fairly short; we took roughly 4 hours to clear everything without hints and in-time, with one hour idle in menus. I still believe that it is worth the price though as it's high quality content with a huge number of community levels and two DLCs I've yet to play.	----->	12

133927533	Only played this game for 15 minutes and loving it. The game has the same feel as Evil Genius and Two point Hospital. I think i will be spending many hours playing this game. RECOMMENDED.	----->	2
133927857	So far, it's been really entertaining, and surprisingly more complex than what I'd expect of an Early Access game, so I'm looking forward to further content.I really love the aesthetics of the game, specially the illustrations and character design. The dialogue is really hilarious, and it really sets the tone of the storytelling. I found all the infraestructures, paths and even energy source management really complex and interesting, this paired with the characters having their own stats and perks, and also the investigation tree, gives the game much more depth than what I was expecting.The game surely lives up to the resource management genre and I think it got to a great start, so I really recommend it!	----->	8
133931161	Interesting game looks a little woke, my base is all women as the men all have negative traits, whereas the women have multiple good perks. A good mix of Theme Hospital (Two Points Hospital now) and Evil Genius 2. Will continue to play. There is typewriter that sounds for all text in game, in which i find a little annoying, and haven't found anyway to switch it off. Apart from that it looking like a great game. Cant wait to see how it progresses.	----->	9

133937394	As an experienced player in the genre, I have to say that One Military Camp is one of the most promising games of the year. This year has been amazing for strategy game enthusiasts, and One Military Camp stands out as one of the 10 best. I've been following this game since its earlier betas, and I've always loved how it distinguishes itself from other games in the genre. The game's progressive difficulty is well-balanced, and the content is rich, providing players a campaign with probably more than 30 hours of gameplay.The graphics are cool and clean, the attention to detail is impressive. The animations are fluid and smooth, adding a level of immersion that's hard to find in other games. The tutorial is perfect for beginners, but if you have played it previously you can always skip it. I love that they don't force you to do it.I am a discord community member and I was amazed with the game's focus on community feedback. The developers have been listening closely to what players want, and they've been implementing changes and updates based on that feedback, in addition to keeping a healthy community. I'm really looking forward to the upcoming sandbox mode and challenges.Overall, One Military Camp is a game that any strategy game enthusiast should try out. It's got everything that makes a great game: a solid gameplay loop, stunning graphics, and an engaged community. I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next.---------------------------------PROS:The art and animations are exceptional.The game has been running smoothly, it seems to be quite well optimized.Campaign with clear goals.Solid gameplay and mechanics.Wide range of options and languages available.It doesn’t look like an Early Access game at all in several aspects.---------------------------------CONS:Sometimes there may be a lot of text.If I don't prepare all the soldiers well, I may have to wait a little longer.I would like to know more about the ongoing missions beyond a loading bar.	----->	29
133938699	Played for 5  hours first run.  Very good game.  Lots to do, easy enough learning curve and different from most building/city games.  I like that you have missions and lots of things to keep you busy....never a dull moment.  Loving this game!  Good Job Devs.	----->	4
133938701	A good resource management game, I'm not good at this kind of games and my camp is broke after the first 4 days, but nonetheless the game is fun, simple and easy to learn.	----->	8
133938757	We have waited and waited and we are not left wanting really, sure the roadmap has the coming features, but the core game is here and its as good as they tote. The graphics are beautiful and very well drawn and detailed. The characters are believable and fun,(can we rename them soon?) And the general mechanics of the over world map is cool, being able to take territories AND having them have specific resources adds a whole new layer of strategy to this title. Get it, i doubt youll want to refund it, its that COOL. The devs are very responsive and the discord is alot of fun to be part of, so pick up the game on sale(more than fair price) and then pop into the discord and join the rest of us as we enjoy this unique cool little title.	----->	14
133939031	The game already comes with a ton of great content (with more DLCs releasing regularly), and the community content (as well as the ability to create your own rooms with a fantastic interface) seals the deal. Do it! :D	----->	9
133940485	Wow I have to say, I'm really impressed with the game. The graphics are super cool and you can tell that the developers put a lot of care into them.I can get lost in the animations for hours just exploring the camp, I really need to get all the buildings just to see what each NPC does, it's hypnotizing.The game itself is really addictive, I want to play more after the first hours of gameplay. It's hard to believe that it's still in Early Access because I feel it's already polished. I'm really excited to see where the developers take this game in the future. Keep it up devs, this is the right path.	----->	9
133943208	It's a surprisingly solid Early Access game. It has a fun and silly feel to it, but actually has a surprising amount of complexity to it and even a fun story to follow. I think it needs a few more tools for managing recruits as I found it difficult to really get an overview of how everyone was doing once you get to around 30 or so recruits.I had one hard crash in two hours of game play, but that's kind of to be expected for EA and performance was just fine otherwise.Definitely worth a shot if you're into sim/management games.	----->	11

133989877	One Military Camp is a decent enough game, with a decent gameplay loop and art style that definitely feel akin to the Evil Genius series. Everything functions, looks good, and plays fairly smoothly (although I did have to tinker with FPS just a little when starting). There are still two areas that need improvement, however, the first being the lack of things to do as your camp is just starting out. There's just not really that much to do while you're waiting for troops to be trained. Later that seems to change, but it's still very tedious. This could be fixed either by an even faster maximum game speed or introduction of increased customization or other time filler elements at the beginning of the game.The other, more significant problem with the game is that it lacks the character of Evil Genius. It's clear they're going for the same irreverent tone, all the way from the character designs to the music choices that are just different enough to avoid lawsuits (I know the Great Escape theme when I hear it on the intro menu). The issue is more intangible, in that it's hard to feel the same love for the material in this that you get from Evil Genius. The characters are all very one-note rather than clever subversion like in Evil Genius. Also notably absent is the suggestion that anyone could possibly die, which is pretty odd for a military tycoon game. The villains look like those that you see in the horrendous Clash of Clan ads that keep popping up for me in Youtube. It just makes me feel like they're about to ask for my credit card information at any moment. They don't do that though, at least not yet. That's why I recommend it. It's fun, in a lazy Sunday kind of way. I bet kids would have a fun time with it, especially if it's their first tycoon game ever.  I'd say ages 6-12 would be a good age range for this. I would have loved the hell out of it myself at that age. I've been working my way steadily though the campaign and it hasn't really learned any true laughs or edge of my seat moments, but it's been nice to relax with. Maybe in the future I'll change my mind, but the roadmap doesn't look like it'll add much depth, just new layers of paint on an ok system. In the meantime, it's all right, at the current price point.	----->	19

134011156	Hi, I love the game specially players can go crazy with their creativity, however there are few jobs/industries available for citizens and commoners. i hope devs add more also harbour for trading i know there's a mod but it would be great if its part of the game. additionally it would be more exciting if there's more challenges and achievements .	----->	9
134011534	It's fun and quirky. The animations and aesthetic reminds me of the mid 2000s tycoon/The Sims games. The gameplay is fun, you have to manage your soldiers and specialises as you unlock new missions, although this is linear. The game will allow you research whatever you want (depending on your base level) and you sort of have to predict what you will need in the future. I wish there was more flavour about recruits, they're all just a name and face. Having a biography and references to previous missions would be fun as you don't really get attached to your soldiers at a ll.	----->	11

134022249	If you like City Building and Management games, this is AWESOME.The developers MUST be city-building fanatics because they get it all right. Lots of quality of life, I am really blown away. I'm a massive city-builder fan especially the old Sierra series (Caesar, Pharaoh, Emperor). Disguised in a camp game is a deep city-builder.Now, here's where I must caution that if you're not into Management games or might be bothered by micro-management, this may not be your thing. You will not only manage the resources, logistics, and layout of the traditional city-builder, but you will also be setting training, housing, goals, and shift cycles for all your soldiers and workers. It could be too much for some. I personally love it, as I am also a big Management fan. And I think they do a good job of giving you lots of tools to help 'manage the management' with lists, filters, and assignment indicators.But really, just some COOL stuff. Great detail in each building and in the interaction of characters and environment. Some objects like light-posts and power poles operate on a totally different grid than the buildings, allowing for particular design. I love the level of zoom from close-up straight out to the overworld. Nice 360, appropriate quality graphics for the style of game. (No GZ, the grass does NOT need shadows XD)And the campaign text of the game, although a little stilted, is actually quite amusing at points (I'll forgive the Star Wars reference even though it made me facepalm). Nice diversity of characters/units. It's a deep, quality game and definitely NOT just a mobile game as one might claim.Massive thumbs up, really enjoying it and looking forward to the polish left to come.	----->	21
134023457	I love escape rooms and had been trying to find a replacement for in-person escape rooms since I haven't been able to do as many of those. I've done a bunch of escape room board games and a couple online escape rooms. Escape Simulator feels the most like an actual escape room because it simulates physical components, searching around, gathering everything, and figuring out the puzzles. The pre-made rooms are a little small for playing with too many people, so that's the main thing that I'm still missing from a real escape room experience, but there are some great community made games for multiplayer (at least for 2 player, I haven't played more yet).	----->	0
134027245	I'm very pleased so far with the game. I like it a lot.The one thing I doesn't realy like, the sergant speeking waaay to much and waay too long, and I have to click and click and click forever to get to the end.	----->	5

134070963	Pretty sweet little city builder/sim game. Loving it so far. Lots of choices with which direction you want your settlement to go as far as you can go military, clergy or labour. Trade with other towns. unlock common path stuff like fishing, churches and such. Plant trees or erect fences to beautify your village and also make your residences more attractive to newcomers. There is also migration depending on how happy your little dudes are. Right now on my first play through I have a pretty good monastery going, so yeah were all pious and stuff. So i'm having fun and I suggest if you like this genre pick it up. It's a good one, worth the coins.	----->	27

134102685	I don't have much to say other than the game is very fun and I've definitely just slipped into it without much thought. The game isn't optimized very well, I found it running very hard on my system for a game that should run like but overall it didn't impact gameplay much. Love it and can't wait to see what the devs do next.	----->	5
134104537	Not a bad game. Played for roughly an hour and the time I spent with it was enjoyable. Micromanagement is crucial. Control your troops work schedule, training and even their specialty in what you want them to improve on. It's a city builder with missions to take control of regions you've lost. For the short amount of time I've spent with the game, it's fun and I can see myself losing hours upon hours... Give it a try.	----->	1

134166933	Fantastic game,I am a casual-ish player and after 150+ hours put into this game I think I have a fair understanding of it. I love being able to pick this up when i get a chance and spend hours creating a city. Whether its jumping back into a city I've already built or starting a new map after not playing for a month of two doesn't seem like an absolute fight to get back into it. Game play is great, fun and immersive. The quests aren't to over the top and feel fair to do.Gorgeous colour scheme and art style, and just look fantastic.The modding experience can really change up how you've been playing, for the better.The Devs are constantly updating and adding new things to the game and nothing seems like its going backwards.All in all great game	----->	21

134190611	Good enough for early access game.The art style look good, the animation look fine.The story line is very linear, to complete the story line without going bankrupt is to research the tech tree ahead of the mission.Also the Defensive building such as Shield Inhibitor and Anti-Drone Battery are very slow to detect and destroy enemy.By adjusting some unit, building and story line this game would be really good	----->	-3
134197194	Amazing micro manager time management game with nice and easy gameplay to pick up and get going. :)	----->	4
134198568	Ok so, we all know this game is amazing, but what's BAFFLING is the in-built creator. It is LITERALLY LIKE UNITY. I'm so lost. If people started with this game, it's like an introduction to level-creation in Unity/Unreal. I'm almost mad I didn't know this until now LOL	----->	-1
134206261	To start things off I really do enjoy the game, I like the unique nature of being the last line of the resistance and being asked to reclaim lost territory. The Story is a bit, odd, but overall is pretty light-hearted and a comedic tone. Though there are a few things I wish the game did better. 1st: To my knowledge at the time of this review you can no edit or change your solider names. 2nd: The 2x speed is SO SLOW. Going through 1 in game day on normal speed is bad, but even on the 2x speed it's still slow. I found myself just sitting on idle waiting for 5, 10, 15 up to 30 minutes trying to train my soldiers to get to a certain level. 3rd: Cash and economy. I'm willing to chalk this up to me not knowing how to play the game at first, but for me I found myself bleeding money trying to build up my army enough so that I didn't have to wait. The game forces your soldiers on a cool down after missions, and if you missing 1 specialization then guess what, your waiting. To combat this you can hire and train more troops, but that also means spending more money. It would be nice if maybe there were some side missions here or there for a cash influx but it's not the cash. Ultimately I really enjoy the game but in it's current build on 3-6-23 it's just WAY TOO SLOW for me to continue. I really hope the devs add in maybe a 3x or 4x speed or just increase the base speed. And please let me change the name of a soldier. Overall, I'd give the game a solid 7.5 to 8/10 in my opinion. The game play just needs some tweaking.	----->	12

134253502	It's fun! Definitely rough around the edges. Is it challenging? Not really no. It's all just a waiting game. Waiting to get money and waiting for troops to train. I've also come across a game breaking bug since I opened the second camp. I traveled back to the first camp and The new recruits are stuck in the recruitment center, and even if I reject them they just all stand in the same spot. I also cannot gain anymore research XP, so the 10+ hours I've spent on this run are all wasted. It's early access so I'll give it a break, but still frustrating. Overall would I recommend it?...yeah. It has a ton of promise and I still have a good time playing it. 7/10.	----->	5

134318169	I absolutely hate going to escape rooms in person.  The people I go with are way too eager and aggressive: running around and screaming at one another.  I also am a bit of a germaphobe, so touching a bunch of things that plenty of people have touched before just makes me uncomfortable.  This game is the perfect solution to it all.  I get to touch anything I want, even break things.  Anybody that I choose to work with isn't a frenetic mess.  Definitely a 10/10 experience.	----->	0

134353804	I wasn't sure how this game would be. Sometimes escape games are so obtuse with their solutions that it feels more like guess and check than deduction. Other times they are so easy that it's kind of a waste of time. However, this game really hits the sweet spot. It is challenging, but has nice puzzles which you can reason your way through. The puzzles are each bite-size enough to play one or two in a sitting without requiring a huge time commitment. It can be done alone, which would probably be quite tough to do (within the time limit), but it is a blast to play with friends in online co-op. You can even have some people sit with you while you play and provide suggestions or ideas to include friends, family, spouse, etc. in the game even if they aren't really into games.If you enjoy puzzle games and/or real world escape rooms, I definitely recommend this game.	----->	13

LOVE this game you have to give it a try! Ok Tip Section Build small and only what you need and keep a positive income stream. Change soldiers MOS to meet your needs, you get stronger soldiers and meet your requirements. Make sure you build multiple research facilities more research equals more unlocks and more options. If you just want to build and fight use Cheat Engine give yourself 9 million dollars and start off with that. Then challenge your self later once you get the hang of it. Because it is a really fun game, Good luck people. 	----->	16
134374376	I don't have enough to say about how awesome this game is!! 1. I love escape rooms and the base content is really fun to play with the themed rooms and a mostly realistic escape room experience  2. The puzzle can vary from pretty difficult to fairly simple but all of them work like a real escape room would which is 'the answer is usually very obvious and within your grasp, it will not be attached under a chair or under the carpet'3. Playing with my friend has felt good and made it worthwhile to keep coming back, I feel for the room sizes having four people feels a little crowded (the newer content fixes this problem)4. All the updates and DLC have been awesome and worth playing, I really appriciate having a reason to come back and keep playing 5. Having the ability to make your own escape room and play other peoples escape rooms is really cool for a feature, it lets people live our there escape room dreams and play themed escape rooms that are fun each time (I do wish there was a mod or something like this that tested the room for bugs or impossible puzzles because about 70% of them have one of these that make it so I have to stop playing the community room)6. If the devs ever think about doing a collab with another game series or movie people or tv series, I would be honored to play it because that would be really cool to have something like Final Fantasy Midgard Themed Escape (that would be really cool)7. I dont know if this is in the community rooms but if you have a import my model/sprites in feature thats cool since then people can be more creative about making a room to show to others That is all, thanks for making me love Escape Rooms more than I already did, it made me want to try to IRL Escape Rooms if I get the chance to 	----->	41

25129305	Awesome game that I would definitely recommend to anyone in Europe or the US, however as I live in Australia my ping was way to high so I returned it. But would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone!	----->	4
25135397	One of the best games I've played in awhile. It's a prefect mix of Twisted Metal, RoboCraft and Madmax. The game feels AAA quality. The sounds are some of the best, .50 cal browning actually sounds like a .50 cal browning. Vehicle customization is top notch and the fact you can build from the ground up with thousand or so parts to choose from. Want to build a VW bus on tank treads with 6 machine guns? This game is going F2P evntually so it may be worth waiting till then instead of paying to get into the closed beta. 9/10	----->	9
25136702	So, it is definitely P2W, but it doesn't really matter. Let me explain why: All those shiny high end guns they have? You can shoot them off. Those power increasing generators they have? You can shoot them until they explode. The destructability of the cars, in my opinion really negate the P2W aspects. Sure you probably won't fair well in the starter car against a cannon, but its not like you don't have any kind of chance. Shoot off wheels and they will just sit there. Blow off the guns and they can't hurt you from a range. Melee weapons (Spikes, explosive lances and the like) seem a bit OP right now, but at the same time, they have to get really close to use them.So all in all I reccommend this game. I'll give you a list here so you can just look at that.Pros1. Total Customization - Build a vehicle completely unique to you.2. 100% Destructability - You can shoot off individual parts. 3. Going F2P - Here soon it will be F2P, you'll have nothing to lose but your time by giving it a shot.4. Graphics - Game looks really good, thats just my opinion, it is subjective mind you.5. Optimized - I'm running pretty powerful hardware, but the game seems really smooth, even with everything going on.6. Market - In-game market makes it easy to buy and sell parts you want.Cons1. Grindy - It can take some time to get really badass parts. Like a lot of time.2. Timers - When you make things, there are wait times. Some of them get pretty long.3. Match Finding - Parties can only go against other parties and it WILL increase your wait time just because of this. Indifferent1. P2W Factor - It is P2W, sure, but the ability to get premium currency is pretty easy and even though the fancy parts are helpful, they can get destroyed in matches (Not forever mind you, you'll always have those parts unless you sell them) and those factors combined negate it in my opinion.2. Bots - More than likely, you'll end up in matches that are comprised entirely of Bots. This I think helps reduce wait time finding matches, but Bots are easy to scrap, mostly. All in all, I do reccommend this game. Remember kids, reviews are opinions, I find that I like this game, you might hate it for the exact reasons I like it and thats ok.EDIT: Forgot to mention Power Score herlping to Negate P2W aspects as well. Its basically your vehicle rating. Match making trys to put you with similarly scored players. So if anything you're just shooting yourself in the foot by buying a bunch of stuff before getting solid on the basics first.	----->	11
25138020	Finally a game where you can build the ultimate vehicle of destruction. Something i wanted for such a long time, but haven't been able to find it in another game.	----->	0
25140117	So there's a lot of misinformation about this game circulating around about P2W.  It may be because of something from prior to the steam release.  Let me explain why this is nonsense.  You can unlock any part and craft it without spending money.  You can make currency by selling parts you make or selling scrap (used to make parts).  You can buy parts and vehicles but you're going to be stuck with players who match your vehicle's rating.  So it's not like you can buy your way to better equipement than who you're playing against, you can just sort of skip the grind to a small extent.As for gameplay this game is sort of arcadey driving with pretty good physics, reminds me of driving a warthog in Halo, except steering is independent of the camera.  Rounds tend to be fairly short and you can go from one to the other very quickly.  The vehicle customization gives you a lot of freedom and there appears to be a pretty large diversity of weapons 30$ is a bit steep but the game is very very fun.  I'd say it's a must buy for 20$, and I'd still recommend it at 30$, but if that's too much for you check back later.	----->	9
25153409	Interstate 76 and Twisted Metal galore :)	----->	0
25154969	It's like Vigalante 8 meets Robo Craft Meets Twisted Metal Meets Battlefield vehicle experience. Graphics can be improved I hope but it's probably a game meant for a lot of hardware to get a big player base. It's early access to play the Free to Play version. I don't mind maybe they will throw the early adopters a bone when it launches and give us some awesome things. Either way if you like the games I described you will like this. There are skills to  be had. It's not like Robot Craft in a lot of ways which is good!	----->	17
25159599	Really fun game! I have a blast playing this game, the matches and all game modes are fun, and the amount of customization is unreal! check out my first thoughts and gameplay here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW1LZlm_gOc	----->	4

25207416	If World of Tanks had good CustomizationIf Twisted Metal didnt die with a whimperIf Mad Max skipped the boring fightingEvery part you place on your car is a destructible piece.Build a truck with auto-cannonsBuild a TankBuild a Wrestling Cage with Explosive SpearsBuild a rolling towerAs long as theres wheels, you can build it.	----->	-3
25215811	Not played long but can definitely say im happy with my purchase. Here are my first impressions.The play style, leveling etc is very much the same as World Of Tanks, if you enjoy that game you will defo like this one. The difference being is that your vehicle Is crazy customizable, you can literally build your car from the ground up and armor/weapon up however you want and more importantly place parts where ever you want (within reason).The biggest complaint I have seen is the lack of matchmaking which isn't true. Just like WoT matchmaking is not based on level but based on the the base body/class of your vehicle, the better body you use allows you bigger/better guns etc which in turn puts you in higher ranked matches. However just like in WoT if you try and power lvl into getting the better body's as quick as possible you wont have the resources to be able to equip your car very well so you’re gonna constantly get your bum handed to you. So its very much worth your while sticking with a body and building up resources to get it well equipped.Anyway that's my first impressions see you at the end of my sights!	----->	15

25225529	10/10 - And I believe its going F2P after beta?Large variety of weapons, parts, and builds. Multiple maps that do not get boring quickly. PvP and PvE with a decent crafting system incorporating both. If you can't see spending $30, wishlist the game and play it once its free! Definitely worth a try! :)	----->	-1
25230910	Amazing game. Hope it takes off in popularity come open beta.	----->	0
25231829	Sure the handling is a bit wonkey, and a few things need their balancing. I came into this purchase with the notation that I'd only play for enough time to be eligable for refund after the whole No Man's Lie Fiasco; i even debated not purchasing due to the fact that Crossout will be a future free to play game, but I've needed something to fill that void in my heart that NMS left there to rot. I digress though; this game is everything it is dreamed to be, and creativity it truly key.You build your own death machine, piece by piece, and either blast your way to glory or watch yourself get demolished piece by piece. Truly a masterpiece; no more robocraft blocks making you feel like a mere child; here we have real engines of destruction that Mad Max has brought us to love over the decades.Had a bit of a world of tanks grind about it; but every match is so invigorating that you get lost in the sheer fact that your turning your victims into smoldering bits of scrap metal. Precision is key, you want to dismantle their tracks/wheels and leave them immobilized while you rain cannon hellfire on their head? Or would you rather charge them full-bore with deadly shotguns, dismantling their weapons armaments leaving them high and dry asking themselves why? Better yet, pimp out a full on charging stallion to melee your enemy into smitherines. As i've said, imagination here is the key and the possibilities are endless.I fully condone supporting this game in its early stages; for only greatness shall come in the future I do hope.FOR VALHALLA! 10/10	----->	-7
25239321	+++	----->	0
25239702	This game is very good for people who like games like robocraft but find it a bit childish. It is a very grindy game that takes a long time to get decent stuff. The crate system would be great if it was slightly better loot but look at crossout container video's and you will see how unlikely it is to get anything of any worth. brilliant concept but still needs some tweaks to keep people coming back!	----->	16
25244576	Mad Max style vehicles, with Twisted Metal styled gameplay, and Robocraft styled customization, each part of your vehicle is destructable and will effect the performance just as the game says. I've not gotten to into the game yet, and I probablly will never update this review again, but I Highly recommend this to any Twisted Metal fan or anyone who likes similar games, and customization, (I've never played a Mad Max game or seen any movies yet, so I cant really recommend this game to fans of MM though I'm almost sure they'd like it)	----->	11
25252205	Insane game. I highly recommend it.	----->	2
25260105	For me the game in closebeta is alot of fun, probly more then i am letting on.They need to tune the craft system in my opinion, which is my only gripe with the game.Lastly its a refreshing breath to the overcrowded market all other game have to be wholly honest.Would twisted metal again and again.	----->	0
25261044	Very Easy to run even on an average computer. the graphics could be a little better but are still amazing. only a few amount of things not finnished but its only closed beta so still imoressive. overall a great game.	----->	5
25266253	I highly recomend this game to any one  for a early release this game is in tip top shape its totaly stable no crashes and runs smooth love this game  its like twisted metal and mad max had a child  best 30 bucks ive ever spent =)	----->	8
25285347	So far. So good. There's microtransactions sure. But the game is super fun.	----->	3
25286274	If you like games like Robocraft you will probably like this (I haven't played Robocraft since 2015 so I base this on how the game was back then). It is a lot of grinding but that is the way it kind of has to be in order to urge you to continue playing. It can be slow and frustrating at times though, especially if you often end up on the losing team.+ Controls well+ Good sound effects+ Acceptable graphics (nothing special but does the job)+ Loading times pretty much non existant (waiting time is another story at times)+ Pretty good variety of parts- AI pathfinding is pretty bad (horrible at times)- Most achievements are a joke!- Slow progression (at least in my experience)- Sometimes long wait times- Some annoying F2P tendencies with credits	----->	3
25302912	Probably my new favorite game! Twisted Metal without powerups and you craft your own vehicle. I'm definately Looking forward to the future of this game.	----->	2
25313346	Love this game. Super happy with that's there already. I love how flexible the build system is. When you play PvP, everyone has drastically different designs. No one design is proving ultra effective yet. And I love that they leverage community built vehicles for use as bosses in co-op raids. It's super fun to build vehicles and experiment with different designs. Rounds are quick. Feels a lot like rounds of Counter-Strike. I feel like the progression system moves at a good pace. I earn a lot of items and scrap metal. Very happy with the purchase and I hope the game does really well so the studio can continue to support and develop the title.	----->	32
25327757	Very good fun, mad max style car vs car, free to play soon, but imo worth the price now to get into early beta.	----->	3
25329086	If you like Robocraft (or how it used to be) you'll like this game.Pros:+ Fast paced 3 minute matches+ There are PvE raids if you get tired of PvP+ Any item can be obtained without having to pay money+ You can test out stock vehicles/weapons before you buy them+ Good sound and graphics+++ The satisfaction of blowing apart your enemies piece by piece until they explodeCons:- It's closed beta so there aren't a lot of players yet (you could help change that)- It can be a bit of a grind to buy/craft high level parts (better than having to pay for them, tho)Bottom line is: even if you don't want to pay $30 to get into closed beta, it's a good idea to follow this game because when it goes open beta it'll be free.	----->	3
25334542	Crossout is a game that brings robocraft and the world of mad max together. Like in Robocraft, you can create vehicles from scratch and mount weapons and various modules on them. There are tank tracks and wheels for mobility with possible plans for hover pods in the future. The creation system in this game is much more restricted than it is in robocraft. This helps to keep the game balanced and fun. The weapons you can choose from range from artillery cannons to a crossbow as well as rockets and machine guns. The modules include things like invisibility and turrets/drones that help you defend yourself or an area. This is a great game to play if you like being creative and blowing stuff up. Just remember, play the objective!	----->	8
25354100	Ok first thing is first its a shooter yes, is it counter strike, no. That out of the way if you ever played robocraft, its like mad max meats robo craft. That is what drew me to this I saw the P2W comments then realised this is gonna be f2p so these just the usual needs an excuse crowd. This game just like other new games Gaijen is helping out like Starconflict has both PVP and PVE going on you do not have to be a master at PVP, like some people think. So to some up, like Robocraft meets mad max, gonna be f2p before year is out, but has PVP and PVE optionsAlright lets start with like Robocraft, meets mad max. If you can't tell form videos and what not you can make your own rides thes all kind of look like standard real life cars but in reality its like robocraft they were just built that way, because it works. You get specaly under carrage parts you can make them long and wide if you fee like it. But most don't got wide as you attack head on normally or camp head on its not bad idea to go skinny and long to fit all your parts.Like Robocraft its based score system but unlike it where you limited on what parts to use, any part you can get your hands on and you do earn armor parts via grind, but can buy, earn or craft ingame all the non armor parts its just a bit of work for the high end stuff. Now the way this works isn't MMO style its a shooter for one, like robo craft its score based every bock you can use has its own score, and stats so you can't make a an armed beast with legendary guns and be in the low level matches you basicly have to be a a pair of tracks, a cabin and a gun to do that lol. Anyways that is how it works.Now some people new to this think every one who is higher then them must be magicly using hte best ever parts in spades. But you can't do this, you can't rock high end parts with out compromising and using paper armor on most your rig. Now what you do is armor one key spot normally the front people don't get that and shoot that one armored part and think its all a tank but a shotgun or cannon shell to the side and you rip off half their stuff there, thanks to the score system, or just shoot off the gun(s) if you got an accurate weapon like maching gun or aiming with a cannon.Now I got that covered here is the next part people don't get, this is going f2p all these max levels you may see, I hardly see, a rank 40. These guys are gonna be reset to one just like you when CBT ends, then on top of that tons of new players with out good gear are gonna pile in right 98% of players paid some kind of cash and bought some pack full of nice parts to start with on day one, but there is a whole world of cheap gamers who will show up when this is new with none of that, and of course complain your too op with your 2 shotguns in the steam pack lol.I warn people of this becuase that freaks them out, yes your are gonna get wiped, but your playing now to learn how to play so one day one, you can b-line for your fave playstyles parts, you can use this time to dink around get killed, kill a few yourself, and look at all these vets builds when you die. Don't run to the garage and rage that you can't reque till your rig is out. You are gonna get wiped anyways, so look at the others when your dead. Make a note of how they did their rigs, how they play the game, and learn so you can try it out. Who cares if you go bust doing it, on day one you are reset as well as the rest of us. I learned heaps from that and now lets play videos of other people with no clue like me, testing and failing or suceeding.Last bit this has a bit of PVE and PVP the way it works is simple you can't just PVE all day long unless you want work for it. PVE requires gas in your tank, every day I think you get more, but if you pvp with a feul barrel, it cost no energy used for impartant parts like guns and weapong radiators, but catch is you want to hide it and protect it, because its a gas tank it explodes when broken and can tear up parts near it when it goes. But you put that in your build and now every win you bring back some gas, and to make it more awsome it doesn't go in the tank with 200 limit you pile it in your storage with the parts for making your rig. So you can pile up tons of it, and sell it if need be to other players for stupid cheap, not really worth it, or just right click pour in the tank to top it off so I can PVE all day.And what is the big diff minus the gas PVE gets you coupons, collect 300 and you can make a loot crate. Think of it like those chests you need p2w keys in other games to open but you don't in this. You open it up and its a chance you gonna get a part from any faction in game of blue or purple qulity or small chance you get a cometice. Now the cosmetic you think oh that is lame these give you rep bonus if you use them on your rig, basicly exp bonus and you can sell them to other players on the market who want that bonus, or just want to make a pretty car with it. You get a cap for these coupons every day based on diffculty, You also copper sheets used to make blue quality gear, and some wires for high end stuff. So even PVPers need to do a little basic PVE if they wnat stay ahead.And that long winded reveiw is basicly what you need to know I didn't share any fun stories or cool stuff like that just basic stuff you should want to know before buying the steam pack. Things people come in and have no idea about. So to sum up again its like robocraft meets madmax, its score based not level. Its gonna be f2p, you could wait till then but then you could also rage about not knowing anything about how the game works first hand, and about people like me using are 2 little shotguns to tear up your stuff, even though I have expeinced guys with common grade lmgs tear them off all the time in pvp leaving me only with the abilty to try and ram before my wheels are shot off next lol And lastly it has pretty decent pvp, and pve system you need a bit of both but could just go all in either one, if you want work a little more, and buy and sell things to get the copper from not raiding, or buy gas because you don't like pvp.	----->	50

25405794	So far, this game is awesome. The PS matchmaking works well (most of the time) and it balances the matches pretty fairly. The game gives off an awesome Mad Max feel to it, and it's amazing. This game basically took Robocraft, removed the pay to win, and then added the Mad Max atmosphere. Overall, I'd give this game a 7/10 as it is right now.	----->	4
25408552	Only played this for 2.3 hours but I have seen enough to know that this game is a ton of fun.Create what you want and take it into battle, see it get blown to bits but rather than raging simply tear it to pieces and rebuild it to suit your own play style.There are some premium vehicles here but I have seen them taken out by good players with personalised vehicles.Give it a go, highly recommended.	----->	4
25455891	Crossout is a very fun wasteland vehicle fighting game that is created by the developer Gaijin also the creators of WarThunder, World of Tanks, World of Warplanes, and World of warships. It has building just like Robocraft so it is easy to build awesome death machines with hella big guns.	----->	10
25457598	This Is the Game You Have Been Looking For!at least that is what i told myself.the customization seems almost endless, though there are a few restrictions currently only 55 parts on my current level. (lv10 as of this review)the only thing missing is Racing, in my opinion.but over all i say that this game gets a 5/5 or a 9.2 out of 10.it is a must try if you like building.it is a must if you like destroying.it is a must if you like driving.it.is.a.must!	----->	4
25461580	Got to say, by far one of my favorite games.I just wish I could easily play/invite friends to a part, and play with them.Hopefully this is resolved soon, in the upcoming updates. Other than that, amazing super fun game!(Has been crashing a lot recently at the time of this review post, but its only in beta.)	----->	16
25473747	Easy to jump into, tons of customization options for your vehicles.  Everything is destructible on a car, lots of strategy for killing enemies and keeping yourself alive.  Think world of tanks but faster with tons of customization and a mad max theme.	----->	-8
25568248	11/10.  Basically world of tanks meets Mad Max.  With customization.  There's a lot for them to add, but they are clearly capable of making progress.WARNING:  Steam accounts sometimes make strange character names if you don't link a premade account.  Do not log in from steam first.	----->	1
25622051	I love this game and the best part is this game is not pay to win. I love the idea of making vehicles go against ones with similar power. The only issue is most people are past lower power scores so at first it seems empty and you'll mainly fight bots.	----->	6

25770413	Your First 9 Reputation Levels are the tutorial. When u get to level 10 there is a big wake up call....... Thats when you start vsing all the other real players with decent vehicles. Until that point you've been on easy street . Now the challange begins .U'll have to swap play styles even the bots are a challange now. BOOM. Players will eat your cars!?!  BOOM. Im not even joking there cars will eat your cars num num num BOOM. Gone...10/10 ive been eaten thousands of times now keep going back for more :)Also Where This Game shines is the vehicle building Component Ive Spent easy 8 + hours is there just throwing Random Builds Together and I havent got most off the best parts yet :)Also If you Would Like to Check out this game Live I Stream Alot Feel Free to come hang out....https://www.twitch.tv/malusvex	----->	6
25793224	Great Game! Played it for hours in one session. Although it would be nice if there were fair matches. I fought a guy that was level 12 and i am level 4. 9/10 until that mechanic is introduced.	----->	5
25831470	Crossout is a challenging and fun game full of blowing cars up like its Mad Max. Set in a post apocalyptic world, Crossout is a game were you control a car/tank hybrid and you craft it out of parts you earn in challanges, raids and pvp battles. This will be Free to Play later on so if you would rather wait until then and not spend 30$ its up to you, but you get instant closed beta access right now if you do pay and founders perks. I would recommend this game 10/10.	----->	5
25838480	Well I enjoy this game i bought it and bought all the packs. Problem is there is too many ai's in the game rooms and not all players are able to join rooms. Most players including me have waited along time to get in rooms and then when we do get in its maybe 2 or 3 players on each team and rest are ai's. and the ai's are programmed over players ability to win. Over all the game is still a plus and can use adjustments.	----->	5
25858555	ggI feel like melee weapons are underrated I feel like they should have some way shape or form to hold them in place as you slowly kill them like grappling hook or oil slick  because they don't really have an effective way to kill people they are pre match the loose cannon of the game they go in the maybe kill and they die	----->	-5
25864185	it is good game. much like verry love	----->	8
25894573	GREAT GAME! The only downside is that it took my money when I paid for a dlc on it and I never got the DLC but steam took my money and the crossout support team is being very healpful but steam was not helping. Every message I got from them seemed automated and unhelpful.	----->	0
25936440	Fun game but... Bots are retarded! You have grind, grind and grind! In game money sucks D! If you want items you will have to pay. If you dont want to pay you will have to wait trillion years to get items!!!!!!!!!!!	----->	-2
26019303	I will keep this review updated, just to keep people informed if its worth buying the game or not early on.[u]Day 1:[/u][list][*] I am trying to play the game without the perks you get ingame for early access, so far it seems alright early game, currently level 6. I have only come across a handful of active players in PvP, which is making PvP missions rather easy right now. [spoiler] As much as I like only versing bots, I noticed a pattern with bots, if you disable their weapons, they are going to try to ram you to death instead of going for the cap point (where applicable, some probably couldnt drive because lack of wheels). Every now and then, a player will hop in and play against me, but so far the meta, personally, is to try to take out guns and wheels on actual players, let the bots kill each other in their weird bloodbath, and if all else fails, earn that cap if possible...I cant tell you how many draws I got just because everyone was trying to kill each other and no one was going for a cap when time ran out. I made the mistake of letting a live player go after disabling his weapons, and they went to cap and ended up losing due to the cap points being 0-1. [/spoiler][*]Now my experience with the premium car you get: I didnt drive it, but it looks nice, but from what I see, it will be great on land, but suck on any wet patch as it not only slows you down slowly, but you cant steer...at all, aka hydroplaning. I see 2 shotguns, so its a close up fighter, but doesnt have much armor, so its really great for driveby shooting if you know how to aim while driving by/circling around. You dont want to be standing still with this car unless you want your opponent to shoot off your shotguns/wheels until you die. Is the car itself worth $30? Nah, the game is nice so far and you do get to keep it and the ingame currency you get into the open beta and final release, so it will be a nice car to boost your level when things get reset. Its around 2000 powerscore, so by no means is it OP, I would reccomend for beginners to use the car for a quick level boost, but for mid to late game, I would think building a newer mashine is much better.[*] The market? I wouldnt bother buying anything from the market right now with ingame currency if you do decide to buy early access, the prices are insane at the moment.[/list][u]Day 2:[/u][list][*]I tried out the premium vehicle that you get from buying early access to the closed beta of this game, all I can say is if you like controllable powersliding, this is the vehicle for you, and its blue rated mostly-everything-on-it, especially the dual shotguns, well placed shots can quickly disarm/disable your opponents. You will have to be at a angle, since both shotguns cant aim directly behind or in front of you. [spoiler]Protip: Sneak for cap point, get 1 point if all you are playing against in PvP are bots, go for 2 if there are live players, you can rush back to get the 3rd if they try capping your point. Aim for the guns, means of mobility, leave for dead until you rinse and repeat for all enemies, then go kill everyone, ez mode.[/spoiler]	----->	-10
26136330	fun game great details, lots of wep/parts/upgrades. can play to unlock everything u can buy, yes its time consuming but u wont b matched with high lvl cars because ur car wont b high enuf u will end up against npc players.  the theory of pay to win is kinda here but at same time u cant buy the best weps/ or even use real money to buy in game money to buy the best weps... so i dissagree with this being a pay to win or u would b ablke to change rl money to in game money.now the edit- messing with teh energy of cabs, literally ruined 5/8 of my saved builds. i would have nvr fuzed a a humpback if i knew it was gonna lose 2 energy. went to play 3 times now since patch and cant seem to find the game nearly as enjoyable as u can see with less than a half hour in last week, and 1100 hrs over last year and a half. if devs keep on the path they r on this game will die like robocraft. P.S dont change teh things we like eg. 12 point humpback,engines being half as much energy/power.ur going to far with the nerfs	----->	21
26139998	I love this game. I need some flame throwers and hover parts Devs. Thx. Great job	----->	3
26241199	So for the first few times i tried this game out, the MM would not work, however that issue seems to have been resolved. so fare it seems like a fun game if you dont mind a grind for getting things. As a fan of several games that have the crazy grind theme going i dont mind it too much.Pros:-fast paced combat-decent building system once you learn its idiosyncracies-both PvP and PvE missions-there appears to be a large number of partsCons:-Not an active community so most games will just be bots-Poor UI for showing damage to vehicle <-Opinion	----->	5
26397692	Great start to an amazing game keep at it dev team.I'm looking forward to the improvements.This game has a fun and simple building mechanic with a great number of different ways you can design your car for battle.Graphics are lush and refreshing.Controls need improving but work ok atm.Dev team is responsive and active i have high hopes for this game.	----->	18

28129882	Hello,If you are looking for a creative vehicle building/battling game i would like to tell you, You will not be let down by this game and here are my reasons.Pros:-The game only limits you based on level/rank you can build ANYTHING you want however it may not always be successful in battle-The game runs on computers from 10 years ago.-You are rewarded after every match if you win-It is relatively easy to build a very successful vehicle.Cons:-It is an early access game and is subject to LARGE and annoying changed at any moment-Players entering a higher rank/powerscore will initially suffer from very many losses due to a weapon shift between high end tier and low end	----->	9

28162812	This is a cute little game and its pretty addictingit has a lot of depth and customization that lets you play the game according to your own play-style, the matches are pretty short but can get very intense and there is a lot of comeback potential.As a dedicated League of legends player I still see myself playing Minion Masters  in between league matches or in the late hours. it has the same competitive and addictive feel but is a lot less Taxing and quicker matches.I like the fresh vibrant and funny style of Minion Masters and the reward systemThis game is still in Early Access and even tho the core game play is great, I'm look forwards to the User interface and introduction to the game getting some more polish and clarity, more Champions would also be a Plusall in all great game with a lot of potential for the future (and im picky with my games) think i would rate it 8/10	----->	24
28185416	Super fun to battle others online in this Tug-o-War game, which reminds a lot like Clash Royale, but is very different even though. The gameplay feels faster and the cards require more skill and more knowledge than in Clash Royale. So if you want to experience a good PC Clash Royale game, I can recommend this one for you :-)	----->	11
28203051	Lots of depth to this game in the variety of cards available.  I hope they continue to add to it over time as I love games that give agency through a selection of units.  Beta Dwarf really knows how to strike a nice balance in visuals and depth, giving their games a very distinct feel.One thing you're going to see throughout all the reviews so far are that people really enjoy this game, despite not liking the payment system.  I wouldn't let complaints over the purchase model sway you away from trying it, though.  It's something easily changed and I'm sure they're taking that feedback seriously.My suggestions would be: - Persistent elements of some kind.  Either per-player or even with the cards in their collection, still waiting for a game to go down that path and this seems like a great place for it to happen! - Clean up the UI when not in a game, having my arena is okay, but it feels cluttered at times. - Add polished transitions between UI-mode and actual game mode. - Add multiplayer modes where I can play with a specific friend, not just random matchmaking. - Add different types of and larger maps.  Not just the two-bridge design. - Clearly this game would be awesome on Android and iOS! - Address peoples' concerns over the pricing model. I'd hate for all these negative reviews to sabotage this title as I would like to continue playing it!Again, these suggestions take what is clearly a solid concept for a game and would make it twice as compelling.	----->	16

28310580	Early Access V 0.9.1Before we start I got a game key for free during alpha but since Early access I bought the premium upgrade at the same price as all new players since early access launch because currently premium upgrade includes in all new purchases.The game revolves in the Forced universe. Betadwarf has made two prior games, Forced and Forced Showdown. I have played extensivly Forced Showdown and had alot of fun with it. WIth that in mind I had very high hopes for betadwarfs third game, Minion Masters.Minion Masters is the PC-variant of Clash Royale were players aquire cards (minions, spells, buildings) and put togethor a deck of 8 cards and battle an random opponent. The goal is to lower the health of the opponents master by 3000 points.(V.S friend battle is in development).Tactics and counter knowledge is crucial to be a winner. All new players gets rubies, shards and gold because of the premium upgrade. Rubies are an purchable in-game currency (it is also rewarded by leveling up at certain levels and raise in leauge rank). Shards are also rewarded in the same regard as rubies, but are not purchable and can also be aquired if by spinning the power tower wheel (it is where you spend gold to get a random card). If you get a dublicate card, it is salvaged and you get shards in relation of that cards rarity.The game is still in beta and under heavy development and balancing. Some cards might be a bit OP. But players with OP cards that plays badly, looses very easily against opponents with common cards. Many people complain over others that have aquired the rarest cards in the game (Legendarys). But the first Master rank I know of (Master is the highest rank in game currently) only played common and rare cards wich are the two lowest card tiers except for regulars that are awarded during the initial level up process. WIth that said. Rare cards does not equal a better card. Tactic and the know-how to counter the opponents card is crucial.THe single-player campin consist of 3x5 battles I belive and is lack-luster at best. These servers more like a tutorial for the player to learn the game and level-up so that you can get most of the regual cards before you get to online-fightning and raise ones battle-rank. THis is a bit sad since I am a heavy single-player player.You get one Master at the beginning. Other Masters go through a free-roatiation system that you can play for free at those time. If you want to be sure to always play those Master you have to buy it with the in-game resources. A Master have diffrent attacks and also a perk system. By controlling bridges in the game you get XP that levels up the Master. Up to 4 Perks can be aquired where that fourth and last perk is always Mana frenzy.All in all I'm happy and surprised how much I enjoy this game. Updates comes regualary and new cards get added with it. New Masters are gonna be added soon. The devs are very communicative and listens to feed-back. Nerfing and buffing is gonna be frequent in teh early stages, but that is to be expected in an EA-game.Graphics 9/10GAmeplay 8/10FUn-factor 9/10(A tip to new players: Before you spend all your rubies and shards. Read forum and play a couple of battles and ask for tips. THat way you gonna know wich cards to craft and what tactic to use. This gonna reduce alot of frustrations early on before you can get most of the cards)	----->	13
28411583	Good gameplay and the monitization is not to crazy. would like more ways to make the in game market currency other than buy beta accses and selling in game items. a reward for raids might work.	----->	4
28450734	More than recommended. It seems simple at first, you have a few cards in your deck, 4 of them in your hand all the time, you continously acquire mana which you spend to place them somewhere in the battlefield, then most of them start walking towards the enemy and they fight whatever they meet on the way. It's simplicity is deceptive, to be really effective one needs to know many things and make good decisions quick. At heart it's a game of countering as the trailer suggests, but to effectively counter you need to know the cards in the game well. On the surface it might seem enough to know which card is able to damage which, but in reality their placement and even the timing of casting them matter a lot, sometimes an effective counter is nullified just by placing it half a second earlier then you should place them. Of course it matters what cards you have in your deck as they can be built for synergy and also variety to be able to counter whatever comes your way, but in my limited experience how you play them is more important. It's one of the better examples of the easy to play, hard to master concept and a lot of fun for a game that you can play using just a mouse in a minute or two.	----->	10

Wer zuviel Geld und Langeweile hat soll es sich holen es dauert etwas Zeit um Spaß zu haben, aber wenn man erst das richtige LVL erreicht hat ist es sehr lustig.	----->	0
28577066	I like it!  Pros:Quick (most games are less than 3 minutes.  I have been crushed or crushed others in less than 30 secs.)FunEasy to learnConsist of deck building skill AND;strategy and tactics during the game as you and your opponent summon and send minions at one another.Cons:-Cost.  $20 for the premium be be too much for many but as the early access has progressed, I am begining to see great value it..  Sure, it is gonna be f2p.  But the want to spend money will probably be strong.  Why?  Because it is fun as hell!,and:-the earning of ingame currency to craft new cards and buy new masters is a tad slow ( I have 100% bonus for a year from premium account, that helps.)Good game.  I like it.  I want to play against you in it.  I used to think the $20 premium account was high, but now I am not so sure, as they continue to release new cards, masters, and constantly balance and hold events. update:  Game is still fun.  Real money is not needed.  Like many games, it is mainly pay to speed shit up.  You will probably be behind on cards ealy on, but just playing through the game, it will not take long to pretty much be on par with everyone else.	----->	5

28658967	Lets get straight to the point. I was debating to myself wether to get Crossout at it's original £24.99 price, but then I managed to get it at £9.99 which after playing it, is a bargain (get David Dickinson in here quick).One of the main things I liked the look of in this game is the customization, and when I started playing it, it did'nt dissapoint. The amount of variety in this game with parts and literally everything is customisable, placement wise to paint jobs. The gameplay is fun and quite easy to get used to, time varies with different weapons because of placement on your car and distance.There are quite a few maps for a beta too, and to be honest the games don't last that long so you don't really have time to glide through the whole map.Overall this game reminds me of games like smugglers run & twisted metal. The destruction is awesome too!! Have you ever saw a tank been blown up piece by piece to just literally the frame and engine? Well if you buy this game you will.Oh it also has a market place that functions too!! So you can buy new weapons and frames etc. THIS GAME IS AWESOME FROM WHAT I'VE PLAYED SO FAR!!	----->	15
28661341	Imagine you take your favorite movie (mad max) NOT THE NEW ONE! the old one, and slap into a blender with the best free game on steam (if your into building things I guess) robocraft. Then you press the smoothie button 4 times over. THEN and only then do you get this game, and boy is it fun.	----->	6
28669736	Well for one the game is heavily underated for the quality and I hope the game gets bigger and bigger. Also the game is fun in general.	----->	6
28717141	Joined the Closed Beta during summer.Playing was hard with durability on items, this was removed in update 0.3.0.Finally playing against people was fun.Constant re-balancing of equipment, ppl always looking for new builds that work best. Some like this, some do not.Currently a bit tiring due to medium machinegun builds running all around. If not that, then it is either a dual cannon or rocket build.Still playing, the f2p Open Beta reset is just around the corner~	----->	1
28719537	Its a very good game but alot of people wont like it because it is some what pay2win. Im level 8 i believe and level 2 guys can kill me easily. Besides that if you want to customize a cool car and kill people with it this games for you.	----->	1
28725781	Cool game, still needs some work, would be nice to have maybe speed boosts. I am new player so, i don't know what all the different parts will bring to gameplay. people say that the acceleration gets better, but not top speed. A little more speed, and a little better driving would make this game so much better.We will see what updates bring in the future. Awesome concept, Hope it continues to get better. I will continue to play. Thanks	----->	7
28732932	I feel like Mad Max causing havoc and destruction on Fury Road. Love the custimization. Controller support pretty smooth if you wish to play with a controller. I actually have an easier time building with the controller rather than the keyboard. Good game. Pick it up. Remember it is EA for a reason.	----->	1
28742228	It might feel grindy but once you realize how to effectively craft and aim towards the vehicle parts of your choice the game becomes a fun multiplayer slaughter fest with a reasonable amount of return on investment, you'll find yourself constantly upgrading your car and tweeking things every hour on the hour. The amount of crazy crap people come up with is also half the battle.	----->	1
28747765	Game is great. But the bots in pvp are annoying as hell. PS system in pvp still needs work, and the wait time for a match is forever. they'll give bots some of the most stupid op weps in the game just to ruin your day, or they'll non stop bug the hell out of you. Even your own bots are prone to ramming you just cause.	----->	-11
28748753	I was sorta iffy about the price when this first came out.Mate from Clan said its half price!!!Bought it right away..Gotta say it's Freaken fun like Mad Max but can build your ride.I like the Trade system so if your looking for a 88mm Because im German Fan boy they have it.Just the Match making for lower tier's bit off but apart from that little bit of lagg every now and then its smooth as santas Sacks :DVery underrated game must buy heaps fun. Glad i'm not banned from chat for 32 years yet lol :D	----->	9
28762486	Crossout is a fun game, it is a game with a Mad Max feel to it. After 10-20 hrs you understand how much grind there is in this game. You can some what pay and skip some of the grindines. There are some modes to play in this game, PvP and PvE. PvP to get your fuel to use for the PvE Raids to get the copper you badly need to craft, wheels, guns ect. I hope they cut down some of the grinding in the game and add more battlegrounds. After what I have seen there are only 4-5 different battlegrounds. I can recommend the game, but maybe not at full prize. It is prized way over what early access games normally are.	----->	3
28801365	if you loved twisted metal you will love crossoutfrom the war thunder devs so you know its a well polished game, the customization is endless you can be really creative grab while its on sale ASAPhighly recommended 10/10	----->	8
28802007	This game is a blast! It's like Twisted Metal meets Minecraft. The vehicle builds are super fun with endless possibilities. My only complaint would be match-making with friends takes far to long to get into a game - but once this is FTP and population grows, that shouldn't be a problem.	----->	9
28807405	This game is AMAZING......... Mad Max meets Twisted Metal meets World of Tanks...... I have to say I was very skeptical of buy'n this game yes in steam db it does only show an average of 50 players but you have to think zbout all the ppl who are not using steam and playing. Now that I have it I have nothing but good things to say about it. You can do PvP , PvE and brawls. You can build your own vehicle or use a blueprint or tweek a blueprint to your satisfaction.The list goes on and on if you ever have a question about it or the current status I would love to inform you. I would love to see more ppl bite on this title and make it grow in its current beta state. Yes you have to pay for Beta and the game will go free to play on release. So to finalize this pick it up and you will be very pleased or wait for it to be F2P but give it a try or your really missing out on a great title.Returning in 2019 and now at 200hrs played im glad im back community is still 50/50 but new ppl are tryn to learn still game is very much still a must play	----->	15

28824363	Look, if you are debating if you should drop £10 on this, DO IT! From the get go i already knew that i was going to spend a disgusting amount of time customising my car.

28886367	[h1]What is Crossout?[/h1]   Crossout is an arcade styled build and fight game where you construct vehicles out of scrap parts and battle with other players or AI enemies. Battling rewards you with materials and parts which can be used to create other parts or sell them on a market. The market is very economy based with buying and selling prices. Usually selling parts yields tax which prevents players from exploiting the market. As you level up and build stronger vehicles, you gain affinity with four factions (Engineers, Lunatics, Nomads, and Scavengers). Leveling with these factions allows you to craft stronger parts at crafting benches (which you have to rent out).[h1]The good.[/h1]   As of December 2016, the game costs around $30.00 for closed beta access. As the decription suggests; the game may go free2play next year so I dont recommend buying it at the moment, but it sure will be good when it is free. The graphics card usage and cpu usage is quite low for stronger cpus and gpus. This suggests that you dont need a high-end rig to play it, but you shouldn't play it on a potato. The graphics are decent considering the strength of the gpu needed. Battles themselves can get intense as different player designs yields different play styles. One player may have a melee based vehicle when another player may have a sniper based vehicle. There are a great assortment of weapons. from heavy cannons to explosive javelins, this game has so many weapon variants.[h1]The bad.[/h1]   Sometimes the game may break and you loose progress or your account and you need help from the developers. Just so you know, the support is very bad. The devs refuse to help you and blame it all on you. If you continue to plea, they will keep denying it and give you false facts. The game itself can get a little repetitive. Build, fight, repeat. It's one of those games you play one hour, then break two hours.[h1]The verdict.[/h1]Pros:-Almost priceless.-Well optimised.-Many play styles.Cons:-Bad customer support.-Repetitive[h1]8.5/10[/h1]	----->	14
28920303	Crossout is a post-apocalypse Mad Max type game. This is the grown up version of Robocraft but much better with rockets, flamethrowers, cannons and drones.Just buy it you really won't regret it.	----->	0

28974106	Fast paced action, intense combat, crafting and goals.  Unique vehicles and decent looking maps.  So far this game is fun, but I am a bit concerned that it might not be 'tactical' enough.  The battles tend to endup as furballs.  Not much thinking involved or strategy.  Point, shoot...destroy.But, it is a heck of a lot of fun to do all the above.	----->	4
28983105	first off I want to say - I use satilite internet - which causes me high ping in most games but this game still runs great even in early accessthis game has a cash shop but you can earn / trade with in game parts to earn said currency - that said I've never felt that the cash shop offered any advantage to my builds and the game gives you 20-25$ of free cash on start to buy parts with you also get parts from leveling in the 4 factions can get it from fighting chests crafting ect - if you can buy it with premium cash you can make it - also while the cash shop raises your power it also causes you to go in higher ranks as vehicles are grouped by power not player level - so the cash shop won't hurt players who don't use it so no pay to winthe game currently uses a mix of players and bots - players are 20-30x as strong as the bots but they tend to have more armor so great cannon fodder - the games weapon selection and vehicle builds are interestingover all the big thing of this game is the mix of sandbox like construction with world of tanks / war thunder style objectives - with both pve and pvp events its very fun with lots of choices and designs to work with - a must have	----->	13
29018324	basically. you can build vehicles and play post apocolyptic bumper cars with them.You can also mount guns on it.I mounted a 75mm howitzer on the back of a pickup truck.my truck flew backwards a few hundred feet, but i still killed the enemy.yeah.This game is super fun, would reccommend it to any grinders, levelers, or people who love building wacky vehicles in games. You can build a truck with 15 wheels, and a howitzer.Would reccommend.	----->	3
29026615	Edit: The developer has been in contact with as I requested, I am eager to see how the final release turns out!Edit 2:After talking with the developer and learning a few tricks and an update I am happy to report that I have changed my review to a recommend.The positives about this game:The fighting is awesome, I found out that you can make in game teams so if you get three people that agree to fight with you, you never have to wait to do a PvE battle!The physics and damage are pretty fair, I haven't found to many weapons OP.There are now daily challenges you can do and daily and weekly crates you can get that fill some of the void of how to get items and scrap to make items.This game is all about building the best tank you can and destroying your enemies with it!The neutral about this game:This game is also all about grind, with level locks every step of the way and the sheer cost of everything to be crafted or bought in the market grinding is what you will be doing the whole game.However, if you were to ask me how to make grinding fun I would tell you shooting an enemies tires off then using a grain thresher on their car till it blows up, or cloaking a 105mm cannon to sneak up behind someone and show them how foolish it was to put all their armor in the front.This game has done something I found very hard in the past, it makes grind fun. So even though I find fault in level locking things and various other leveling related problems, I do not give it a negative score for that, because when you are in the swing of things you will look up and realize you advance three levels without noticing!The negative about this game:The marketplace is a little broken including everything being way over price and the fact it has a strange 10% tax for no reason.The Item Crafting is very broken! Remember what I said about grind: This is what is needed for crafting a 1st level ammo pack:2 - Basic 75mm cannons = 300 scrap each to make / 15 from a standard battle = 120 minutes of battling2 - Basic Machine guns = 300 scrap each  to make / 15 from a standard battle = 120 minutes of battling2 - Basic Shotguns = 300 scrap each  to make / 15 from a standard battle = 120 minutes of battling50 copper = approx 7 a game x 3 average minute game time = 21 minutes of just fighting450 Scrap (none from the 6 guns we broke down to make this?) = 90minutesso 7 hours and 51 minutes of game play to make a single 1st level ammo pack, but wait it takes a real time hour to craft (again for some reason unknown to me)So the actual time is 8Hrs and 51 minutesNow, you can buy stuff from the market, there are daily challenges and seasonal ones to help with the cost, but I would like to ask did 8hrs sound like a good idea in development?Did someone grind to make an ammo pack to see what it felt like?If at anytime you decide not to make that item, you will not get 1/10th of the price back it cost you to make or buy those guns if you sell them.If you want to hook people for the long haul, add new things into the game, the whole game is about battling and it's fun as heck! Don't go for the cheap hooks like this, ditch the weapon requirement or at least make them make sense and you'd have a great crafting system.All in all the crafting is the only thing I really have a problem with now, and I plan on buying what I need from the in game market so if you are a person who does the same I highly recommend this game!If you like making someone wish they had prepared for your triple rocket launcher cloaking sneak attack that removed all their guns and half their armor, then this is also the game for you!Happy hunting!	----->	11
29028864	This game is crack..very addictive. Post apocalyptic themed build your own tank mmo is how i would describe it. It looks beautiful, maps are huge with lots of space to run around. As of now we have 2 game modes: raids and pvp battles. The game is a bit of a grind though so if thats not your gig I wouldnt recommend it. 9/10 so far in my book and its not even open beta yet.	----->	1
29043254	This game is very promising. As of closed beta, the texture are still low quality but the gameplay is a  lot of fun!I can't wait for it to be public to have more people playing it.	----->	0

29136824	Having played for a while i can say the game has come a long way since it started. Balance between weapons is alot better then it used to be and the developers are actually listening to people to better the game.Defiently recommend this game now after all its changes and the constant event and extra content makes it even better.	----->	6
29153186	this game is fun. But i will say more times do i get into a game with more enemy players than i have frendly players on my team. they are always have better cars guns and armor. i wish the game was a little more even about the multiplayer, my last conplaint is that this game is way to pay to win, i ran out of in game money in a matter of seconds. i would like it to be easier to get gold and copper. that is all i have to say about the game.	----->	3

29342179	An incredible mash up of engineering, mechanical & shooter elements. If Rocket League and World of Tanks had a baby.... There is a huge amount of freedom right from the start in regards to building and customization. Player driven market that actually makes sense and fun match system for both pvp and pve. I will recommend this game for many years so long as the devs keep up the momentum.	----->	9

29421362	Looks like a phone game ported to PC. This game need a fast forward option, the action happens to slow & i have no patience for it. Looks good & fun but need lot of improvements.After played like 20+ matches online i can say that matchmaking is terrible, i won just 3 of those matches while getting my base nuked by pro players vs. newcomers, so league thing sux.Also, since is on Steam every game should have Steam achievements, no idea how i missed that to see... maybe in the future... and 2020 is here & game improved + achievements are here too.	----->	12
29435243	very fun fast paced action definitely one of gaijin's better games out there	----->	6
29435555	Amazing gameplay but a little bit grindy. I would love to see more game modes and less grindy but otherwise amazing game	----->	7
29453590	I don't do reviews often (maybe ever?), but I have to admit I'm enjoying this game alot.  Yes I paid to play it in alpha, which if you wait, you can play it for free.  With that said, I'm glad I did get in early.  There is a bit of learning curve when it comes to building an effective build.  Does it take long to learn, a couple of days and watch a few videos on it, it's easy enough to get the hang of, it's just not World of Tanks or such, you have to build your tank instead of just unlocking the next one.It's fun right now, but when it goes open beta and free to play for everyone, that's where it's going to shine.  More real players, less bots.  Which if I had to gripe about something it would be the bots.  One game they are realy stupid, but other games they fricken take over and own everything.  But like I said, more people playing = less bots = more fun.  I used to be hooked on World of Tanks and games like it, this has finally pulled me away from WoT, probably for good.	----->	16

29633614	A shockingly fun game. I got this from a friend who had an extra copy. Both of us thought it would a cheesey little game we would forget existed. I was wrong. Quick ques and the games are short and refreshing. Losing doesn't feel bad at all. Even gaining new cards is fun in how it is presented.Recommend. Spam minions at peoples. Win. Repeat.	----->	6
29641776	Would like to have an way to turn off bots or not. Good I think it's pretty balanced. Turrets need nerfed though.. ha :D	----->	5
29703969	I had a long winded reason about why I was on the fence about this game but to be honest after hearing from the dev team and reading up on a few more things I gotta say.  THIS GAME IS AWESOME.  It's pretty, gritty, fast paced, voilent, explosive goodness that should fill everyone's vehicular rage niche.[strike]I really really really want to reccomend this game but for the most part I just can't bring myself to.  All in all the game itself is fun as all getout, has lots of interesting concepts, tons of customization options, very few bugs, beautiful graphics, awesome dynamic gameplay, and a pretty nifty progression system.  That aside it's really only fun for the first 10 hours or so when everything is new and exciting.  After the inital dive it gets grindier and grindier in true gaijin fashion with each successive tech tree requiring you to mash together a pile of parts from the previous tree, which (who would'a guessed it?) requires you to grind the same missions over and over. I do understand this is still beta and they are working on things but as of right now pvp is almost unplayable in some aspects for newer players.  Older experienced players stack vehicle parts of high rarity and literally drive circles around other players while spamming one shot barrages of missles, cannon fire, and bouts of flame.  That is, when you even get games with other players, most of the time you will play against bots even in pvp matches.  For the most part it has the makings of a great game, but as of right now it needs a lot of changes, attention, and work to be polished into something great.[/strike]	----->	27
29753839	it's the same type of game like Clash Royale, but I would prefer Clash Royale since it's free on Apple Store and also better imo	----->	5
29760365	Damn ... it was a hell of a time since I got this pleasure in a game !Get the mad max theme , mix it with robocraft and a touch of twisted Metal Black ( or Vigilante 8 ) and you get a brilliant baby : CROSSOUT !Easy to play and so much to unlock , build , test , try , explod , etc ...And it's still a BETA so far , come and join lads , you won't regret !	----->	-1
29767754	Okay, have to update my review of this game again. Its like the 5th time or so. Gameplay is good and fun. I have become addicted to this game. 2 vs 2 adds alot.  It would be nice, to get all the cards with one price. If that is added later, that would be great. Rush decks have been changed, cards in general are  changed(not nerfed into oblivion like other developer handle such things) regulary.Lots of problems have been addressedOverall positiveI left the bad things in my old review that still stand. Deleted the outdated problems.Old review:In short:If this wasn't free to play, it could have been good.Its extreme slow in getting new cards after the initial phase.And you need a good pool of cards to stopp different decks.Problems:1: Slowness of getting new cards:1000 Gold per Card. a won match is 8 Gold (with premium upgrade 16 Gold). Losing gives like 4 Gold. O.Odaily quest give you one card. Rarity systems prevents you from getting the useful cards.The other daily thing, this free spin only gives you small amounts of money, rubies or mana. You have to spin every day for 15 days to get 1 card.Also you can use like 3 times the same card in your deck. So disenchanting your exess cards will not happen until very late.  If i get a card one time, why can' i simply put it in 3 times in a deck? Because they want to sell me cards would be the answer. In the beginning it draws you in with new cards every 3 matches. Then it stops, even with premium upgrade it becomes a boring grind with losing a lot of times.Why losing a lot of times? See point 2	----->	7
29787441	Very fun game. Simple, yet has some good depth in terms of strategy and tactics. I would highly recommend Minion Masters if you enjoy this type of game (Clash Royale, Castle Wars in WC3, Nexus Wars in SC2 etc.) and want to experience it on PC.	----->	12
29805361	Pretty good game! Haven't played it that much yet, but maybe I will expand after more playing.Nice first impression!	----->	4

29979569	[h1]Minion Masters[/h1]This is a great game that is fun to play and even more fun to compete with mates. Its like the well known game Clash Royale but better. You get to choose from a wide variety of 'minions' and just have at your opponent. Attacks are great and fun to watch and the fact that at the moment the game is not pay to win is fantastic. Im really hoping the game doesnt turn into another pay to win [strike]game[/strike] like most of the other purchases you can make on steam. I would definetly recommend this game to anyone with a pc and anyone with the ability to click a mouse buttonAussie Out!	----->	34
29979739	Do you like Hearthstone? Did you rage when madder bomber hits you 6x in the face instead of that friggin Moroes chilling on the other side?If the previous questions apply to you, get this game right now. Cut the RNG and up the strategery!	----->	-1
29986998	One of the best golfing games when playing with friends! The custom maps are the best part.Easily 10/10	----->	6
29988500	One of the best crazy golf games I've played.Usually I play 'Golf With Your Friends' with a few others. While 'Golf It' is slightly lacking in some of the crazier options of GWYF such as low gravity, big balls or shapes. It makes up for it with better and less bug free gameplay.Input is analogue based, moving the mouse to swing the putter. A far better method than the power-level of GWYF, where it was easy to remember a power-level and angle to get an assured hole in one. There's an option to change the sensivity of the mouse and the putter speed to your taste.The maps are interesting, fun and really good looking usng the Unreal engine to good effect. Hopefully some more graphical effects will be added later to really utilise this engine a bit more.There's a couple of holes that are really hard, particulary on the mine level, trying to get the ball onto moving carts.I'd like to see an option added in the future to decrease the size of the holes. AS it is it's a bit easy once your close to get the ball in. Making the holes optionally smaller would add a little bit more challenge for seasoned players.I tried to have a look at the editor, but I couldn;t find any way to add stuff to the new map I started. A tutorial or link to an instruction manual would be really helpful. The option to allow friends to edit the maps with you is quite original, I'm not sure if that measn you can all edit the map, or just one of you while the rest comment...or critique like the muppets I play with.All in all it is by far one of the best crazy golf games, if not the best. Pricing is spot one.	----->	22
29989811	One of the best golf games.	----->	3
29992157	Awesome Minigolf game, it's a great alternative and I've already had a great time with my friends.The few Maps that are already given are great but the best thing about this game is that it has got a map editor, so there'll be many new maps created by the community.9/10I can really recommend this game if you've got some friends to play it with.	----->	14
29992214	One of the funniest games so far! It is a great party game and one of the best featers is that you can create own maps with your friends together! It works very well! Also ladies and gentelmen go buy it!	----->	6
29993936	Good golf game with nice soundtrack.	----->	3
29996173	The game is still early access but it is pretty solid so far, I have only played solo so far a few rounds just to get used to the mechanics of the game. I found I had to turn up the putter movement from 5 to 20 because it just took to much eeffort to hit things hard.The one thing I would love seeing is Jumping like GWF, that simple mechanic makes it so much fun to try to cheat the maps. Some small tweak I would say is decrease the ball size and the hole size because that hole is the size of a basket ball net.I would recommend people to get this game if you enjoyed GWF, making your own holes?! sold!	----->	11
29997961	Really good game, much better than golf with your friends. Physics, graphics and gameplay are so much better. I guess Unreal Engine is the better choice  to programm a good game. Awesome what one guy can do in this Engine against 3 noobs with Unity and no skills in anything .Good job	----->	9
30003359	For first day early access it seems really well done so far. Very fun game with friends, seem like a more polished version of Golf With Your Friends, both are great games though, but this one has a 1st day release with a level editor which is gonna bring loads of content :).  Just needs more customization options to give your games more variety when you want to spice it up a bit, but I'm sure plenty of stuff is planned.	----->	10
30012950	Better than golf with friends in almost every way, collision makes more sense, graphics much better, the different elements and physics (particularly in the ice level) are spot on and the sounds are amazing in comparison... There are a few bugs to work out where balls don't reset when hit out or in the water and some tweaks like lobbies persisting after a game is concluded to more easily start a new one Overall highly recommended	----->	6
30022848	Really awesome mini golf game, If you enjoy Golf With Your Friend and Tower Unite, you'll certainly enjoy this one.Concept: The idea of using the golf club to hit the ball is what makes it unique and different to the others. Graphics & Art Style: Simplistic and very professional, similar to the Golf With Your FriendsControl System: It's a little clunky at the moment as you have to Click & hold the right mouse button to bring up the aim line, then click and hold the left mouse button to bring up the golf club and finaly pull back and shoot. it's not very fluid.Audio and Music: Suits the style of the game, very cherfull and puts you in a good mood   	----->	11
30023099	Nice game with an enjoyable multiplayer. Gotta try to make my own maps.	----->	0
30023256	This game reminds me a lot of Golf with your friends! It is better though, because of the editor you can have unlimited courses and unlimeted layouts for your courses!The editor is a little hard to get used to at first, but after you get the hang of it, you will be making your dream courses in no time.Keep in mind this is early access, so bugs will happen, but honestly I didnt see many in my first couple hours, so give the game a shot!	----->	1

30368378	The best Minigolf game I have played! Ofcourse it is in Early Access and not finished yet, so small bugs might appear. But there are updates for the game almost every day! And man -  I love the Controls! It's very intuitive and unlike some other golf games , you have no bars that you can memorize on how much power you need to play! It actually feels like  playing Minigolf!There are 5 standart maps to play for now + User created Maps! But the best thing about it  is the steam workshop and map editor! There are so many Features in this game and I feel with almost every updates it's getting more and more. Since it's early Release people have created tons of very cool own maps that you can play! So this game has also user created Content like for example the Trackmania games! This makes the Gamecontent last forever! I absolutelly can not understand some of the negative Reviews here, because Feature and Mechanic wise , it's the best Minigolf game so far! The Multiplayer ( local or online! ) with collissions on - is so much fun! For like 9 euros you should really give it try!	----->	16
30382527	[h1]Number One Complaint I've Read[/h1]The number one complaint I've read about this game is the controls for putting the ball. I went in thinking it would take me a few hours to get the hang of it. It took me about [b]30 seconds[/b] to understand how it worked, I cannot understand what the challenge is for some people in figuring it out. You point the ball in whatever direction you want it to go, left click to set it in place, and then the putter appears. You actually use the mouse to swing the club, so you have to move the mouse quick if you want to hit it hard, or slow to just tap the ball. [b]It's the closest thing I've felt to actually playing minigolf[/b], bar none, the best controls for a minigolf game. [h1]Rest of Review[/h1]I haven't got a chance to play any multiplayer yet, as I just purchased this a little over an hour ago. I went through the first 18 course hole, Grasslands, and it was fun to play through, even on my own. None of the holes felt poorly designed, or lazy. The physics from hitting the ball never went crazy, every hit went exactly how I expected it to go, depending on how hard I hit the ball. I was not disappointed, in the slightest, with my purchase after completing that course. I look forward to seeing what the other courses look, and play, like. Also, for whatever updates are to bring to this well-crafted early access game. I enjoy Golf with Friends a lot, but this game adds more to the genre, along with [b]a lot[/b] more customization, than GWF probably ever will. I've always wanted to enjoy a map editor with a friend, and this is the only game I've experienced with where that is finally possible. The editor is very complex, and you can get overwhelmed by the options presented to you, but if you're like me and explore/test things out, you'll figure most of it out within half an hour, at most. This editor is lacking in the tutorial department, by a lot, but I figured that will be added on at a later date. I spent around an hour just goofing around and finished designing a single hole, and was so pleased with the outcome. I haven't been this excited for a map editor since the first couple far crys.[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]With the lack of tutorials, I think that is this game's only downfall, as of right now. I didn't experience any bugs myself, but I didn't play for a long time, and I plan on pouring a lot more hours into this. The graphics were fantastic for a minigolf game, I don't know if it's the best out there, but it's the best I've seen. The soundtrack was soothing, I'm not a stickler for the game's having a poor/awesome soundtrack myself, but for other's sakes, I would say it fits with minigolf very well.I would give 'Golf It!,' in it's current state, a 8/10. After a few updates, and tutorials added for those who are having troubles with the game's controls, it will be even better. I look forward to seeing the progress of this game, and hope you enjoy it as well, should you decide to purchase it.	----->	33
30402097	This is an awesome game that we can enjoy alot with friends	----->	6
30408754	Golf It! is a fantasy themed mini golfing game.  The graphics are very whimsical-esque and range from an underground theme to a winter wonderland theme.  The game is in Early Access but it seems to be an EA game that has a solid standing, unlike other games that have weak releases or are very VERY early Alpha demos.   There is not a whole lot to say about the game, mostly due to its nature so I will list the pros and cons and then have a final note.Pros:[list][*]Easy to pick up and easy to play[*]Decent graphics that look good enough to enjoy without being hyper realistic[*]Interesting map themes[*]Mini golf sandbox (will talk about later on)[*]Steam Workshop capable[[*]Devs have positive attitude[/list]Cons[list][*]Certain levels dont feel balanced but no biggie[*]Minor bugs and glitches[*]Not much variety or challenge once you beat each course[*]Music used for each map theme gets very annoying after the first few times of hearing it[/list]Final thoughts:    I saved this part for the last since this is the biggest and best feature that the game has going for it.  Gold It! has a sandbox mode where you can make your very own golf course.  I only spent a few minutes on it but for those who have always wanted to make their own mini golf course design, this is for you.  You can choose a bunch of assets and visual effects and what not.  There are people who have already made a bunch of maps already, many of which are very enjoyable to play.   When I have time, I plan on trying it out myself, but for now, its a great feature for those with the will to make a course.In short, this game has a fair price and offers a few hours of entertainment, more if you are into creating your own maps.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys some casual mini golfing and for those who enjoy creating maps.	----->	22

30460523	I didn't know how much I needed this game before I had it.It's the perfect duel game. Fast paced, short games with lot of strategy both during the action and during your deck crafting.I only whish it was free so I could convince more friends to play it.	----->	5
30476440	Love this game! Controls are a bit hard to get used to at first, but I myself picked them up quite easily! It's unlike any other golf game and it's amazing in my eyes.What about map makers?The editor has multiplayer!? I did not expect that from this game at all! Yes, it's a bit buggy and a little glitchy here and there but it works amazingly well! The only thing I wish for in that (which it is under development) is that when you duplicate an object, it keeps it's properties instead of resetting to the default (ex. candles, rotators, transformers, etc.).The steam workshop integration allows for hours of amazingly fun gameplay and you should definitely gather a few friends and play a game! Even if it's only just you and one other!	----->	8
30516532	A great game with a better control system than the rival. The editor is already good enough for use and you can find a lot of maps in the workshop, so you can have fun a long time with custom maps. And who hasnt dreamed of building his own golf park?	----->	12
30571786	This is the best golf game on the market right now.Pros-The controls are fluid and you have total control over the ball-Physics are a tad heavy but it makes everything feel more solid-Multiplayer level editor-Steam Workshop -Super fun with friends-Developer is very active providing constant updates and support on the forumCons-Bit buggy but its early access so its to be expected-somtimes the ball can get stuck in a divit in the ground delaying the game while the clock keeps ticking -currently the developer has bought some art assets with the intention of hireing somebody futher down the line	----->	10
30608538	The game is fun to play but after a while you realize that it will require more time or money to upgrade. The match making is uneven. Players and bots with better weapons always win. Worth the $30 but the developers need to do more to improve match making.	----->	8
30623955	This is what this game is about:25% owning noobs25% getting owned and one-shotted by higher lvl players50% stocktrading (you need to - getting money by playing the game can be quite the grind)It needs more players, but 30 dollars are quite a barrier right now... So i would recommend waiting for the open beta to be released	----->	0

30763415	After numerous updates the game now, has a lot of potentialThere are a few Negatives:Not being able to see the ball in certain areas because trees or foilage is blocking your view.Workshop map makers tend NOT to check their maps before releasing, leaving areas unplayable, and forcing you to quitThe good news is:You can create your own maps, and even edit the errors on those worshop mapsAs long as you do not play with overly serious competitive players, you will really enjoy the game	----->	5
30820737	{Update} My account got hacked and lost all my progress they gave me random parts that do not match so can not make anything good so i gave up on the game so make sure to keep password strong and safe or will lose everything and devs will not help much due to the market that player based.[h1] I love this game [h1]Hello, this game is a lot of fun you build yourself up from little car to huge tank most of the things i disliked are gone and i'm really enjoying it and i can not wait for the OBT i say give this game a try i love this game and wil never stop playing it i have played it since the start almost and not stopped playing i got it on steam and still play many hours on it with my clan i hope they add more stuff to clan's that all i hope and i have no other problems with games i think you should give this a go because it's well worth it....

30884592	I was looking for a similar gome to a Twisted Metal for a while. And i finally find it. This game is totally worth the price. There is no games like this so far! Extremely fun to play, game runs perfectly no bugs no crashes 10/10. Can't wait for an open beta test to see more plareys in the game.	----->	8
30906376	Love it! I have this and Golf With Your Friends and they are very similar but both super relaxing, fun, and are very worth the small amount of pocket change that they are charging for it! Couple things Ive noticed that need to be fixed. Whenever you hit pause it doesnt stop the timer on your game, the textures on the Winterland map need to be fixed so that you dont see the squares in the snow. It needs to have a simpler way of knowing if the game you hosted can have random people join it. I cant tell if the check or the x is the thing that says its a private game with just me or someone else can come barging in. It needs to have a mode where you can reset the shot so you can attempt to get a hole in one at every hole on practice mode. I see no button that says restart course or restart hole. That would be great if you dont get ranked on your score on that map. I would also like to modify my ball and my putter by colors and shapes, there might be a possibility for a store where you can buy cooler stuff but I really dont want to see this game being turned into a pay-to-play. Overall its a fantastic game for relaxing. Love that theres a good workshop for it. Yes, you should buy this game.	----->	17

30948013	This game has so much potential. Sure, the mechanics aren't working properly every single time, which can be depressing sometimes. But the solution to it is just a matter of time. And the Editor has great potential aswell. I mean ... hello MULTIPLAYER EDITING! Best idea ever. I am looking forward to the future of this game. Gret thanks to the developer for this game.	----->	5
30948413	Awesome game so far! With a little bugfixing, it could easily become the best minigolf game out there. Best part is to hear ur friends rage when they fail! :) Maps are pretty well made too.	----->	2
30951514	Pretty neat game with a lot of fun when playing with friends.The editor provides constant addition since there's also workshop support.+1 for the leaderboards - adds a small competitive aspect.	----->	6

30982212	[i] Comparing to Golf With Friends [/i]If your like me and have previously played Golf with Friends then this game will do you well. Both have differences. This game is less buggy and much more fun. There is even an option to download maps from workshop or make your own. How great is that? The controls are a bit weird at first, for someone who uses a mouse mat with a wrist rest, it makes the game awkward.  [b] Recommend? [/b]Yes, I do. Go ahead and purchase the game. RIGHT NOW. It's worth and loads of fun.	----->	5
31007526	The exclusion of a power bar adds so much longevity to the game. You can't just memorize where to aim combined with what power in order to score a hole in one. The power is based off of your own physical motion, making each shot unique. Also, the ability to create and upload your own custom made courses is amazing. So much can be done in this game. 10/10 would stroke again.	----->	1
31008061	I wasnt sure about a minigolf game cuz no game ever could beat the fun of a real life minigolf game with some friends and some beers, but I was kinda wrong. Me and my friends had lots of fun playing this game and creating our own maps, which kinda feels like minecraft in a social way (just my opinion). Sure they still have to fix some bugs, but those 2 guys are bringing updates like every day, so I am sure this is one of the best minigolf games you can get at the moment. Keep it up. 	----->	14
31011976	It is great	----->	3
31053870	Only takes a few hours once you get the game to undertsand how stuff works fairly simple. But the online with other players theres only you and 2 or 3 other people in the battle with you and the rest is just bots needs more active players. It would be worth the 30$ if there was active player to battle with. Other than that game is very enjoyable and i hope it grows.	----->	4

31220559	Finally, a minigolf game with a swing interface that requires some skill and adds an incredible amount of depth to the play.  You have a developer who is constantly adding new features while squashing bugs in multiple, weekly updates!  Not only that, the dev actually listens to customer feedback, replies to discussions and implements many of the user suggestions in new versions plus he's a genuinely good guy:).  The multiplayer with friends is super solid, haven't had a single connection issue and pace of play is very quick which is a good thing.  With the integrated course designer that allows you to create the course of your dreams (or live cooperative design with friends, unbelievably cool) there should be a huge variety of course freely available to play as the game continues to develop a following.As good as the game is now there are some things that can use more tweaking.  I've recently been playing a round or two on Friday nights with a small group of friends and the most common complaint I hear while on Discord is that at times the golf ball doesn't bounce off walls with enough energy.  Another one is that the ball can take too long to come to a complete stop when on a slight grade.  Fortunately, these are both simple issues that I have no doubt will be addressed.  If you've bored to death of the same courses in GWYF and want a mini golf experience that requires a bit more skill you will absolutely love Golf It!   	----->	11

31316382	I've always wanted to design mini golf courses and the level editor in Golf it is super-flexible. The developers are very helpful and friendly, and helped fix a problem I was having within a day!The latest update is amazing might have to make some more levels.	----->	4
31319269	This is a really good game overall. It's a gaijin game though, so there are some pay2win elements but it doesn't seem to make much of a difference because the coin packs ingame are expensive af, so everyones grinds pvp matches and raids to make money selling crafted stuff on the market instead. Even when you are outclassed you can still win everytime with enough skill and good tactics. I haven't had any bugs or problems with the game other than some bad ai players that would get stuck often on certain levels rendering them useless teamates. The updated ai seems better now and they make less stupid mistakes but still needs more work.Hopefully the rough edges will be polished by the time the game is out of beta.	----->	0

31368258	This game adds a unique twist on the Putt-putt genre by making your mouse part of your stroke.It's addicting, calming, infuriating, and a time sink- in all the best ways. Enjoy playing tons of custom made courses, the official courses, or making your own courses WITH YOUR FRIENDS. That's right, you can make courses with your friends in the editor cooperatively. This game takes the cake when it comes to the putt-putt genre. It's a hidden gem that is only 2 dollars more than the competition. It wins across the board though with regular updates and attention coming regularly. Get this game, get some friends, get your stroke.	----->	7
31370332	Alright this review was suposed to be for the hamilton beach 33461 stay or go 6-quart portable slow cooker. I purchased this particular slow cooker after doing some research on 6-qt. units.

The replayability isn't very high, and the developer maps don't last long, however, there are custom maps. You can easily make your own maps with the amazing built in tools. It worked amazing and it didn't take very long to make a good 18-Hole course. Definitately worth $9 and I hope to make a whole series of maps in the future.	----->	19

31795447	Shooter? - CheckBuild my own dream machine? - CheckFree 2 play? - CheckFun to play? - CheckI don't know what more you can ask for. The game has a psuedo pay wall. To craft in the game  you need gold, gold is only obtainable with purchases at the store... but it's also the currency at the player driven market.So that means the only gold in the game right now is from players that paid money. If you're purely a free to play guy, and you have 0 intention of supporting a f2p game with $. You are going to have to grind your arse off to make it anywhere.That being said the grind while high is reasonable. Especially if you consider the time you would play in a year worth of play. And hey; if you don't want to wait a year to craft your legendary item that's totally up to you. Don't be such a slouch, chip in some $ and support the game. ;)TBH I don't mind the F2P model they have right now. The game is based on power score, if you can build something with 2000 PS with common items you are going to stand as good of a chance against someone that tried to down level their tier and using some blue items. They will end up making some very telling sacrificies to come play with you and your rig should be stronger in other area's.... also you shouldn't be trying to play solo. A smart player will always be better than some solo zerging wallet warrior.	----->	16

31831691	Absolutely brilliant game. Much more creativity and variety of maps in this game than in golf with your friends, so there are many fun courses to play. Also, you have to judge the power yourself by dragging the mouse, which makes the game enjoyable and challenging. It's much better than the power bar used in golf with your friends, as this makes the game too boring and easy. The custom maps are fun as well, as you can create your own fun maps, and play ones made by others. The graphics are good as well. I would highly recommend this game.	----->	20

31891125	So I will update my review for Crossout.If you have ever heard of Robocraft, this game also has vehicle building, a garage, and a base capturing gamemode.That's where the similarites end.Overall, it's much different from Robocraft, and apparently it is more pay to win. I can't have an opinion on that since I bought the Closed Beta Test pack and got 2000 coins when I first played Open Beta Test. There is very much a grind, if you want rare parts from the market, and even more so if you want epic parts.Vehicles are built out of parts of varying sizes and you cannot buy more structure pieces, you have to level up in a faction to get more. And instead of CPU/pFlop usage that varies with different cubes, there is a parts limit that maxes out at 80 when you level up in the Engineers faction.Crafting is interesting, basically you get the required stuff for what you want and then you tell the faction people what you wanna make. If its in a high tech workbench, you need to buy a thing that lets you use it for an amount of time.Have I mentioned the market? The market is not like the cube shop or cube forge, where prices are set in stone. Instead it is player driven and the prices go up and down. You can make offers and also directly sell the items in their most expensive purchase or buy on the cheapest sale. It also includes fees, so that the market does not inflate and it keeps people buying coins. The more rare or unobtainable an item, the higher the price, even if it is a common item. The more of an item there is, the cheaper it will be. If there is less of an item, you can charge more for people to buy it. If there is more of an item, you can lower the price of it to sell it faster.Try it yourself to see if you like it, it's free. This is just my opinion on the game and you might have a different one.	----->	6
31897630	For a game still in development, I've enjoyed this game very much with my friends (8 hours so far). It's a simple game, course design in interesting, a little luck is required (like any mini golf games), and even after becoming comfortable with the controls, I've come back to play it over and over. Worth it for the price if you're looking for a golf game with pretty graphics and replayability.	----->	6
31959556	good game !	----->	3
31975270	nice gameplay good graphics.	----->	6
31981300	Golf it is a pretty fun mini golf game where you can gather a couple of friends and talk nonsense while playing a couple of maps. The big advantage of this game is the level editor and though i haven't myself made more than a couple of holes there are enough map makers for there to be fresh levels when i want to play a bit with my friends. Hopefully this will continue to be the case. Overall the game does what you would expect a mini golf game to do and there is a bunch of map themes and gimmicks which can be used in maps.The game do have some problem and these are more visible in custom made maps. The hit boxes of objects often does not fit their visuals and tiles sometimes does not fit perfectly together which can cause the ball to go in unexpected way. You can of course blame it on the map makers but it is still a problem. Sometimes the physics also seems odd and some levels causes frame rate problems. I have also encountered some problems joining games but it has often been solved by restarting the game. The music can also get a bit repetitive.	----->	6
31984934	This game is pretty fun... for the first hour. after a while, you play every map. you get board and do everything. then go to the editor. but it is too hard to make something.. This game is way better with friends. I recommend this game is you have friends, and not a loser like me!	----->	3
32027037	good	----->	3
32041094	Really great fast paced vehicle combat game.Building vehicles is really great, theres a huge amount of parts and it does feel like u can really make what u want. Theres great variety on the weapons even including things like deployable drones and turrets aswell as modules like scopes and radars to add. Parts are shot off of ur vehicle so how u build it is very important to how well it functions. Smart design can really help ur performance.Has a fairly high level of grind but not uncommon for this type of game esp as F2P. However there are ways to deal with this, for example u can level factions which earns u a lot of parts quickly to get going and completing seasons (a series of challanges that reset every so often) can earn u very good rewards. There is also a player market to buy and sell parts so its possible to sell items u dont want to get the parts u do.GFX and sound r gd and the game runs really well.Overall great game well worth giving a try.	----->	25
32044699	My game won't run past the laod screen. Once I click play, nothing happens! Yet if I look in taks manager, the executable is running. I tried running the 32 and 64 bit versions. Nothing! I've uninstalled and deleted all local files too, then re-installed. I am running Windows 10 and just udate to the Creators Update. I think this is it, but I am not rolling back the update because of one game.I've been playing for months and never had this issue. Anyone else?

32681593	I own both Golf It! and Golf With Your Friends. Both are great games, but they have slightly different feels to them. My friends and I will switch between the two games depending on which style of gameplay we'd prefer for the evening (or sometimes play both!). GWYF is slightly easier to get into and the controls make the game slightly more reasonably competitive. GWYF also has a more polished feel. Golf It!, on the other hand, is a little more zany (for lack of a better word), and the controls add more pressure to every shot.With the addtion of extra clubs and considering the possibilities available with the level editor and Steam workshop integration, this game has almost infinite replay potential.	----->	2
32689331	Very fun game. The way your controls work is very fun and diverse.Also the customization of your ball is well done.Community maps? Over 600 items in the workshop; Awesome!Do play this with friends and you'll have a lot of fun due to different settings for the gameplay.Hence it being an early access game I'd still give it an 8/10.	----->	12
32689509	Picked up this game during the Summer Sale with some friends as a game to play as a group. After playing a few rounds, this game is officially amazing. Level design is fantastic, good complexity and a fun world to hang around in. Lots of laughs when all the extra settings like jumping and collision are turned on. Still a few minor bugs with it being in early access still but there aren't any serious problems, the game plays as intended. I give this game 4 Nike Swooshes out of 5. You'll be golfing like John Daly and having just as much fun	----->	14

32711647	Fun mini golf game, especially with friends. Features unlockables similar to rocket league. Decent amount of courses in the workshop so far. As for any early access game, there are chances of bugs and what not.

32813220	Basically golf with your friends but with steam workshop. I have no idea what the people are talking about with all these glitches. Other then the menu not being super smooth it works fine, haven't found anything game-breaking yet.8/10 because steam workshop and level editor	----->	2

32828690	I am enjoying this game so far.I bought GWYF too to compare the games.BTW don't forget to create games with 32 tickPros:✅realistic physics (better than GWYF)✅you can download maps from workshop (that means you can create your own map!)✅you have trials, hats and more other cool stuffCons:❌GWYF is a bit cheaper❌8 player is max in one game (in GWYF the max is 12 players)❌not many people owns it so you can't easily join in other peoples games❌there is only 1 type of golf ball in golf it but you can be cube, egg, cylinder, puck (ice hockey ball) etc. in GWYF❌there is no power bar✅OVERALL❌I liked this game more than GWYF because of the Pros I wrote down below.HOWEVER if you don't have any friends who owns this game, I don't recommend you to buy this because of the lack of players.There will be edits because both of the games are in early access7,5-8/10	----->	4
32836003	Great game, bought it a few days ago in the Summer sale and all my friends did the same.

32955619	This game is really fun to play with your friends. As an Early Access game I expected more bugs but most of them actually don't interfere in gameplay. There some workshop maps that are fun to play too. And it isn't really hard to create your own map. The only problem is, as a early access game, there is not much content yet, so I would recommend buying it if there is any discount.	----->	7

33046878	Fun mini/putt style golf game specially if you like Golf With Friends.  The thing this game has going for it over GWF is its steam workshop support so there's lots of levels to play on vs the 5 or so GWF comes with.  This game doesn't have as many customization options as GWF does and of course the putting style is different where's GWF uses a meter to determine how hard you it and Golf It uses your mouse to control how far back and how fast you swing which is more technical.  I'd say get both games but although this has a lot more course choices to play on me and my friends still play GWF 90% of the time over Golf It for all of its customization like ball sizes and shapes and hitting style.	----->	5

33173056	Golf It is essentially mini/crazy golf with a bit of ball customisation (skins) and a few other rules such as ball jumping, changing club and hitting your opponents ball out of the way or knocking them back down ramps and obstacles to troll them to hell. As a single player game it only has 4 courses and will get boring quite quickly but add a few friends, discord/skype and a custom map and it's great fun and well worth £5. I'm not saying the average player will get hundreds of hours out of it but its defiantly a game to kill the odd half an hour here and there. Me and my friends do a Sunday evening online Golf It session every week as the course designer and builder allows you to download new maps from the Steam workshop and create them with your friends... coop map builder how cool? something Golf with your Friends does not have.I think it's a better game than Golf With Your Friends purely because it has Steam Workshop content and you can build and download custom courses. There are currently over 1000 courses on the Workshop made by players. It plays pretty much the same as any other mini/crazy gold game on steam.The devs have basically taken all those browser and webpage mini golf games added a few rules and allowed friends to play and troll you by allowing players to take shots at the same time and race to the hole.New players can download my courses from here http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198130063094/myworkshopfiles/?appid=571740Cheap, fun and simple but works well.	----->	6

33370444	First and foremost, this game is not pay to win. Obviously, if you do pay then you can get things quicker, but it doesn't really have any major influence on winning or not. I have been using a combination of cards that is mostly made up of the ones that I started the game with and have won more than I have lost. With regular playing and completing the challenges, you can build up a good deck and save shards and rubies to open up new characters and arenas. Obvously, if you are impatient and want to get everything immediately, then paying for the premium upgrade will help you to unlock all the main masters and some arenas. Some grinding will always be present in games where there are unlockables.A lot of people have made the comment that the game is dependent on luck, which I don't think is entirely true - tactics can win the game. Spamming low cost cards will sometimes work, but carefully using the deck will get around this. If you don't invest time in the game, then it will feel superficial. Give it some time, try out new masters and card combinations until you find soemthng that works and then go with that.The graphics are great, the animation is smooth and the community isn't full of people shouting obscenitites at each other. Gameplay is well paced and balanced - but it does take time to master.An excellent game that I look forward to seeing grow. Highly recommended.	----->	22

33407045	This is definitely a game that needs to be played with friends. The levels are tough at some points, but nothing that is too difficult. This is a game you play before a big game or after to destress. I don't regret my purchase. I've played every level multiple times, and they are all lots of fun.	----->	-1
33415962	Great game. Fun with friends and with loads and loads of crazy maps on workshop it will provied countles hours of fun.Perfect to relax after a competetive games of something like OW or CS:GO	----->	0
33444107	Golf it is another fun minigolf game on steam. I do enjoy Golf it as it is harder to play than most so there is that challenge part. The game is easily in Early Access mode as my friends and I have found many bugs, but we expected that and actually came with some extremely funny moments. I do like the maps already in the game and cant wait for new ones. With the workshop there is an endless amount of courses so it is not as boring as Golf with your Friends. I enjoy this over GWYF for some reasons, but vise versa for GWYF. I would have to say GWYF is my favorite as the controls just seem better, but with the workshop this is a CLOSE second.	----->	12
33446078	Wasn't a big fan at first coming from Golf With Friends but now I've seen the light. This game is with out a doubt the best social mingolf game on Steam.	----->	6
33447070	Golf it! Is a game that is basically what its name is. You have to get the golf ball into the hole. You can play with friends or by yourself (i think) its a bit of a rage game but you can do it. :3	----->	-2

33524007	Hey cool game ive been playing alot of it with my friends im enjoying the workshop content alot. Some things i would love to see if possible are i know theres a custom menu, can we have the ability to use A/D to move the ball added into the custom options aswell? or maybe the option to add some sort of backspin on our shot just so we can fine tune the game a bit more in custom because i think that would add alot of fun to the game. Also i hate to compare your game to others but will their be different ball options? like hectagon, square ect.. because there are other games in this genre that have that option and i think its a ton of fun :) or maybe some sort of gravity physics option? just some ideas take em or leave em. Love the game! cant wait to see more and a final release :)	----->	16

33632292	pros: - content; although theres only about 5 standard courses the workshop is already full of user created content thanks to the - easy to use level editor with an easy sharing feature (lots of user content including imported assets thanks to ue4) - constant updates/fixes so far although it looks like a small dev team ( 1 person? ;) ) - great replayability - different playmodes and alternate clubs (giving course creators a lot of possibilities)cons:- playerbase; at the moment there sadly aren't that many people playing this game- performance on some of the custom maps- buggy ui - initial loading time (takes about 2 minutes for me to load the game - after that everything's fine)if you keep in mind that this game is early access and the cons will probably be adressed on release,this is a great game to have some fun with your friends, and if the playerbase keeps growing even for some solo adventures. ;)	----->	19
33649127	The idea of this game is decent, it's quite fun to play in your spare time but it justs gets boring, personally I belive it died due to the rise of clash royale. If you want a pc version of clash royale basically you should buy this, I got this game for 39p and with that i got a free copy, so it is quite cheap and comes with 2 games. THis game is pretty fun and is easy to run.	----->	5

33825361	Post-apocalyptic Lego, where you build a vehicle and battle AI or other players.Reasonable system requirements, atmospheric visuals, good physics and the pure joy of building craft, checking how it performs and browsing ideas of other players.F2P game where grinding is involved, no big surprise. You can also buy stuff with hard cash if you so desire.An addictive 7+/10 for me right now. After the addition of more game modes and perhaps some parts, this might become a juicy 9/10. We shall see, for now - recommended.	----->	4
33827783	A reason so many are QQ'ing? They cry P2W Pay to win! omgoose! Pay to win = Items and or buffs you can only get via real money, and this game lacks that entirely. Paying players get stuff right away! Yes, yes they do. But it's 100% nothing that you cannot grind for on your own.Fun game, weekly / bi-weekly patches, free form building, good weapon selection that's only getting better very soon.  What's not to enjoy?, if you can tolerate the grind.Only down side is really that the general chat on average without GM intervention becomes as cancerous as chewing tobacco ;o Well that and seal clubbing at low gear scores happens fairly often. Group up if you want to live :D	----->	11

33895518	It's good fun, but I do not like that I have to play this 6h a day to get money. It is a good game, but it's pay to win at this point! But.... if you play for like 1:30, you get around 100k. When you start out, use your starter money to get good! guns. Trust do not spend it on to make your car/truck to look good, just guns.	----->	13

33919366	This game really isn't pay to win as some reviews would have you believe, you can get premium cuurency just by selling the stuff you get from grinding.

33957135	Fidel is a puzzle game with top-notch design, strikingly gorgeous art, and a lovely protagonist. It's also wickedly challenging, the sort of game that can be equally maddening (in a good way) and extra addictive. I wholeheartedly recommend it, especially for players who love squeezing out every bit of gameplay and hunting for secrets.Fidel manages to be rewarding in a way few games can.	----->	10
33957655	As someone who really enjoyed the Witness it's great to see the not only the line-drawing mechanic reinterpreted as a fast-paced dungeon crawler, but to have many of the same revelatory moments occur in a completely different context. It's a perfect median between very contemplative puzzle-games, and action-oriented roguelikes.	----->	6

33961331	A creative and fun puzzle game that looks simple on the surface, but becomes more complex with it's different mechanics as you progress through the game. Each run for me has lasted no longer than 5 minutes, but I find each of my runs improving in length as I learn the patterns associated with each enemy and puzzle presented to you. Easily worth the price.	----->	9

33974492	Wow, this game is fun, fast, and tricky! Dev once said that the original inspiration for this game came when he was designing a puzzle panel for The Witness. I can see the resemblance! Finding the best path is a real joy, especially because you can take back moves after you make them so you're not just staring at a screen trying to solve the puzzle. Instead, Fidel is always adventuring, trying to find the best path, and maybe sometimes barking. Like all great rouge-likes, the real joy comes from understanding all of the interactions in the game. Like when I discovered if I combo three enemies in a row, the red spiders flip over, vulnerable, until another enemy is killed. It's worth the money!	----->	13
33974657	Fidel: Dungeon Rescue is a strategy/puzzle dungeon crawler in which you play a dog called Fidel who is attempting to get through the dungeon to rescue your human. There are 16 levels and each one has a different type of monster and different concepts. In order to survive, Fidel has to find the most efficient path. He cannot go back across his own trail and must try to get to the end whilst gaining as much experience and coins as possible so that later levels are easier, but with limited health and a lot of monsters in the way this can be a real challenge. Some monsters have different tactics that you need to get around them, for example the man-eating plants which need to have their flowers killed first, forcing the main plant to close so it can be killed or the three-headed turtles which can be attacked without taking damage from the tail. There is a reasonable range of opponents, with each level being quite different to the last. There are also buttons and switches, traps and walls to navigate.You can take your time to try and find the most efficient strategical path to the exit and if you make a minor mistake you can go backwards and try again. If you die however, you have a very brief window before your ghost catches up with you to make it to the exit. Failure results in starting from the entire beginning, giving it that roguelike quality. As you progress through the level, you can unlock useable items (with coins you pick up) and level up, giving you more health - but nothing persists through death.It's a quick game. You can play for a few minutes, die and put it down. Playing it in short bursts was the most fun for me - perfect considering I'm currently on maternity leave looking after a tiny angry human, so my choice in games lately is definitely more on the side of things that can be picked up and put down very quickly. I'd like to see this on the mobile market - I'd definitely pick this up on the iOS store.  The main downside I can see is that some people may not consider it amazing value and depending on how smart you are, this could be a fairly short game. At £5.99 it's a little more expensive than I expected and some may prefer to wait for a sale. There are also no resolution settings; although you can change the size of the window.Other than that, this is a fun, fast, casual strategy game with decent retro music.[h1]My verdict - recommended to anyone looking for a casual game that still requires a decent amount of brainpower. If I had to give it a score rating, it'd be a solid 4 / 5.[/h1]♥♥♥ If you're a weirdo who wants to follow my reviews, please clicky some links: [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28971565/]My Curator Page[/url] and [url=http://www.twitter.com/playwithath]My Twitter[/url].

33975525	It's not really a puzzle-puzzle game, but it does make you think alot. Kind of action puzzely. Surprising amount of depth.Although the gameplay is extremely different from tetris. The closest game I can think of is tetris, where you want to work out some puzzle-like stuff, while going at a pace. Therefore being a action-puzzle game.Similar to tetris, this game have given lots of people (including me), tetris syndrome. Play it!Edit: Probably my goty 2017.Edit Edit: Some parts of this review is no longer that true because there was an update to give the player more time each level. But it's still a great game nonetheless, still dipping back for a run or two even in 2021	----->	5
33976159	Beautiful combination of a fast paced puzzle (yeah, they made that work somehow) with a roguelike game. Very quick runs turn this into one of those games where you just HAVE to play one more round.Some more clarification on certain things would be nice, maybe in the form of quick hints as you play. For instance, I discovered after several matches that if you press enter you can switch the start and end squares, which is useful in some levels since the positioning of the enemies and loot is not symetric. I'm also still not sure what the last item that you get when you collect coins does.In any case, extremely recommended game. Now if you excuse me, I *know* I'm going to beat it on the next run...	----->	2
33979809	Really nice game, love the pixel art and the fact that it fits in a small window. Very bad for productivity hehe!I really like the puzzles, I love all the things the author did with a few rules. The only things that I don't like are some punishing mechanics, like not being able to go back if my doggy dies (I go back but the ghost always catches me), and having a time/steps (not sure) pressure to complete a level (hate that ghost). Another thing that I felt is that there is a big increase in difficulty from level 1 to level 2. On my first try it was a bit intimidating, maybe on the first try I would have liked a few intermediate levels.Overall a really good game, if you like exploration, pixel art and logic puzzles, definitely check it out!	----->	19

33982569	It's original, it's quick and pretty well done.I enjoyed the 20 minutes or so I spent playing it, but I won't be returning. The levels are all randomized, which to me is a cardinal sin when it comes to a good puzzle game.Still, it's worthy of a recommendation and some folks out there may really enjoy it a lot!	----->	8

34002527	Amazing art, challenging puzzles that always change. I can not get enough of this game!	----->	0
34004311	If you like thoughtful games with tight design do not miss this!  The gameplay is quick but requires careful decisions.  Fidel also achieves an old school sense of discovery about the way enemies work and little secretes that arent always immediately obvious but feel incredibly rewarding and exciting to discover as you play.  Definitely grab this, very well designed game that seems small at first but surprises you as it expands its world  and depth with secrets.	----->	8
34004510	It is indeed a good game. Jonathan Blow does not lie.It's really easy to pick up start playing, the core rules are simple and from then on everything flows in a very intuitive way. The sessions are relatively short, so you can squeeze a couple of runs whenever you have a few minutes to spare. And each time you learn how to interact with the different enemy, hazard and feature of the levels, which make you plan your moves in a different way. Soon you realize that the game also has a lot of depth, which makes the game challenging even after quite a few hours. Plus, lots of secrets! And the art is just great. The sprites, the animations. Super cute. Just look at that dog! Hard not to love.	----->	4
34004805	Excellently addictive puzzle crawler with fun secrets to uncover	----->	4
34004812	I really enjoy this game. its a creative, fun, and intuitive game with an interesting world. many people complain of the games pay to win features, but in all honesty, ive never purchased a single item in the game and i am perfectly competitive with anyone in the world. the game does rely pretty heavily on your abillity to design a functional war machine, and ive seen many of the same people who complain of the Pay to win issue are also people with realitivly low quallity machines. i would recomend this game and would ask many people to ignore the other various claims because at its heart its just a fun game.	----->	14
34006658	this dog can bark. 10/10 (Level 16 of area 1 Makes me want to cry)	----->	1
34006716	Long time I haven't been so hyped by a game.The strength of indie video games comes from originality and DAMN, this one is original in many ways.If you like puzzle games, to discover secrets, to laugh, to save grandma and to SCREAM AT A F***ING GHOST, then you should stop reading this review and start playing it.The game teaches you the basics in a very short puzzle, after that you'll have to learn what monsters do, how mechanisms work, how to gain the most XP possible, by yourself.It is adorable, intriguing, smart and funny.I played it for 9 hours for now and there are still secrets to discover.Well, it's time to save grandma now, see you!(And don't forget to bark.)	----->	9
34008320	Simple premise, lots of depth, brutal difficulty, cute dog. What more do you need?	----->	2
34008459	Fidel is a fantastic, fun, and fiendishly difficult mash-up of the puzzle and rogue-lite genres. The art and music are cute, but don't let that fool you. This game is no joke and will kill you quick if you don't think about your moves before you make them. The experience of playing Fidel is a great combo of the desire to take time and strategize your way through each level, along with the time pressure that if you take too long trying to perfect your route, a ghost will show up. This aspect is obviously similar to Spelunky, and although the game takes a lot of inspiration from there, I'd say it holds its own in that comparison, with a similar level of variety and challenge. I may actually enjoy it a bit more since it doesn't have nearly the focus on reflexes that Spelunky has. Overall, I'd say it's a great game and definitely not to be missed.	----->	7
34008700	Great game! I thoroughly recommend it.Brilliant enemy design leads to very diverse puzzles. The ghost applies enough tension and pressure to force you to use your instincts instead of ratholing on a single level. There’s no handholding – discovering the mechanics is part of the game and really interesting and surprising. 	----->	-2
34008823	A very tight, very demanding puzzle-ish game that uses a simple, easily learnable set of mechanics to force you to make mind-destroyingly difficult decisions; getting near-perfect completions of most of the later floors requires you to think five steps ahead, but you don't have to be anywhere near perfect to progress to the next stage, which is a pretty lovely nugget of design. You gain items and health for doing earlier floors better, so performance on early floors affects your ability on later ones, and even when you can't figure out the perfect solution you're always pressured to do as well as you possibly can.The randomly generated levels will occasionally throw you a floor you can wipe in one try out of instinct, and occasionally something that has you completely stuck, which can be demoralizing near the end of a good run. There's also a timer on each level, which I guess is there to make sure you can't be TOO cautious, but getting wrecked by a ghost when you're 3/4ths of the way through a tricky level can feel frustrating all the same. Despite these gripes, each individual puzzle is still a joy to solve. I don't know if I'll ever be able to 100% this game, but I find that just loading it up and playing a few floors is satisfying even when I don't get very far. I absolutely got the Tetris Effect going the first night I bought this, when I played it for an hour or so before bed.	----->	16
34010455	This game combines the mystery of rogue-likes with the discovery of puzzle games in a way that takes the better parts of both genres and ditches the worst.It's real good.	----->	2
34011446	It's a good game.	----->	3
34014044	Lovely game so far and perfect for just a quick session here and there. I love that I'm slowly able to get further and further as I learn the game and discover new things!	----->	6
34014247	This game is  just plain fun, with a deceptive amount of depth in the puzzles.  I'm looking forward to playing this with my kids who are also excited for this game!	----->	3
34015203	It is an interesting game. It's challenging but has a good deal of charm.	----->	5
34015922	Great puzzle game to play on idle time. Short download, instant startup! Great aethtetics. Easy to play, hard to master. It's very rewarding when you progresively succeed in getting your head around its mechanic.	----->	1
34015932	The level design is as tight as it gets. You may go over and over through the same levels, but you always find a new way to play it, or in the worst case, they are still entertaining.The sound feels very good, i love the BARK of the dog.Also, best main menu ever.	----->	3
34016535	It's a very good game. I can't stop playing it, gotta 100% it.	----->	2
34018854	Fidel's devs somehow managed to make procedural levels that feel hand crafted, that leaves you wanting to play better every time, learning new secrets and discovering the underlying rules of this world. Start casual, die quickly, and start to become hardcore. And don't forget to bark!I barked at a spider and it pooped itself: instant classic, GOTY, 11/10	----->	-2
34019605	This is an excellent game.  It is a fun challenging puzzle that I am having a great time with.  The game does interesting and surprising things.  I don't really want to say much more than that. :) <3	----->	13
34019907	This game is brilliant. The rules are simple yet the game has a ton of depth. There are some genius enemy designs here (especially the vampires!). Oh and there are secrets, lots of them! I recommend this for anyone who liked games like The Witness, 868-Hack, Spelunky, or even my own game, Trainyard. PS: Make sure you try barking at EVERYTHING. You never know what will react!	----->	4
34020154	TL;DR -> This is an excellent puzzle game. <-It may look simple, but this game is amazingly deep and complex. It just has way to much to share with the player. Much more of what you can see at first glance.The game grows in complexity with the player experience, so, every time you start the game all over again, is going to be matched up to your current hability.It will always be a great challenge, not matter how many times you finish it.Everything else is just right. Simple, but charming.I don't usually expend time writing reviews, but i actually feel that it's my duty to recommend this game! If you like challenges and puzzle games, you have to try this one!!	----->	12
34021147	A great little game that has that 'One more go' feeling in spades.Cute animation to boot.	----->	4
34021477	This is a wonderfully designed game that's tuned to near perfection. It's an absolute steal at the price and a must-play for anyone who likes puzzle games.	----->	0
34021578	This game was such a joyful experience for me from beginning to end.Fidel doesn't hold your hand but it's extremely good at conveying all of its mechanics through encouraging experimentation. This is a fast-paced puzzler which grows with you and every time I close the game I immediately want to open it up again for more.You should own this.	----->	7
34021727	Fidel is a game in the style of The Witness and Stephen's Sausage Roll, where the game has a certain set of mechanics, and the consequences of those mechanics are explored. Sometimes this results in great comedic effect -- particularly with the Alien boss.Gameplay is super fun and not stressful. Each run lasts about 5-10 minutes, so dying isn't aggravating, since it's usually pretty quick to get back to where you were last run. All of the rooms feel very fair, and it's possible to progress through them without a perfect route.The art and the sound effects are excellent, and really contribute to the feeling of joyful exploration.There's also a good amount of replay value, since the game has plenty of optional challenges that stack on the difficulty. I found the default mode pretty easy, but the challenges get pretty tough.I recommend this game. It's a lot of fun.	----->	28
34023747	I love puzzles and strategy. (And secrets) and this game is perfect from what I've seen. I will be playing much more of this. :)	----->	6
34026592	This is a fun little puzzle dungeon crawler. Lots of interesting mechanics and secrets to discover, with a very cute and polished presentation. My only gripe is I wish it was on a mobile platform where you could pick up and play more easily, but otherwise recommended!	----->	9
34026902	I'm not sure if the term rogue-lite applies here but there is definitely a random element to the game. At it's heart Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a puzzle game, a very good puzzle game, It puts a board in front of you allow you to attack it as you see fit. You are also able to rewind moves as you make them, and you will definitely need to rewind. I have beaten the game multiple times but still feel compelled to play more of it. That is the mark of a good game for me, and that is why I am recommending it.	----->	5
34029146	Fidel is a really well-designed game. It's hard and you die a lot to learn how things work, but play sessions are short and there's a ton of depth and subtle details. Highly recommended!	----->	-4
34029513	10 runs in and it's amazing so far. Super tightly designed. A lot of value out of a small package, could easily be sold for $20 and still be worth it.	----->	6
34030762	Fidel is a very well designed hard puzzle roguelike with a good presentation. This game is also not as simple as it may look at first glance. Recommended.	----->	2
34031232	Okay, so I haven't beaten this yet, but it's really good.Puzzle-crawler is actually a very apt descriptor of Fidel Dungeon Rescue. If you like either of those types of games, you're in for a treat. Fidel's design is simple, devious, and very satisfying. The art, sound, and gameplay all form a very coherent package: short and sweet, and ridiculously replayable. You may not understand what you're doing the first 10 to 15 runs, but then the game's design begins to reveal itself. That's when Fidel gets its hooks into you. I might come back to this review. I just urge you to give this a try if it piques your interest.Edit: It's still good, actually it's better.	----->	0
34031284	Great game. Each level is simple, yet challenging. As the game progresses you learn more and more about game mechanics that are either new or something you didn't realize was possible. No story, no instructions, but the way the game is set up intuitively allows you to learn. Would recommend to anyone who loves a good puzzle game and dogs.	----->	4
34039961	++ Fun to play with your friends, the big plus is the map creator. You can really create whatever you want and it's quite easy to get the hang of it. Plus you'll never run out of holes as the steam workshop is full of well-built creations from the community. -- Can be laggy and lack optimization overall. There could be more default maps, but they promised to add a few more. A lot of people seem to criticize the aim & shoot system but I think it's just a matter of experience; you get used to it after a few games. To me it's even better than a classic power bar where you just have to click to shoot; here you actually have to move your mouse and imitate a swing movement which is quite fun.I would definitely recommand this game, but only if you play it with friends. The game is not really meant to be played alone.	----->	2
34042621	Greatly recomended for a cute lunchbreak roguelite. Rounds are short and challenging. Something you want to get if you have that one [i]small[/i] gap of time in your life where you can't find anything to do.Also, you are a dog. (Which I mean that is one of the greatest pros about this game tbh)	----->	6
34042671	Fun short puzzle game. Watch gameplay before buying cause it's a hit or miss. Game is well made so no problems in that department. Don't forget to bark.	----->	-4
34055691	One of the (if not the) best tug of war available on PC.Pros:- Free.- [b]Not pay-to-win[/b], this is a very important point. Many reviews claim that this game is pay-to-win, but top tier players can reach top 1-5 with almost only basic cards.- Very quick battles, often over in under 5 minutes.- Good card variety allowing for different strategies.- Your deck consists of 10 cards, and your hand of 4. This means you can quickly cycle your deck, and the game revolves a lot more around skill than luck of the draw, like other card games.- Next to no RNG. Some cards are pure RNG, but they're a gamble you chose to take. The only RNG that's forced on you is the initial hand and draw. Some decks rely on a single card that you buff / heal, if you don't draw this card first, this can be a problem. However, this is also a risk you chose to take. You can make a versatile deck that has an answer for almost everything, so any draw can be useful with those.- Looks great, and sounds nice.- Draft mode and 2v2 if 1v1 isn't your thing, this means you can play with a buddy.- You can customize your arena, as well as your master. There are also emotes you can use while in-game.Cons:- Some balance issues, as is often the case in PvP games.- You need a good computer to be able to run it on max settings.- Not a huge playerbase, this means you will see the same people often. This is a bad thing for some people, a good thing for others.	----->	15

34096852	I wanted this to be a relaxing puzzle game but the timer/ghost changes that dynamic. I know many players like a little pressure and say it's not a problem if you get better. For me it's an immediate turn off and I'm not interested in playing long enough to become ghost-proof. I'd rather have an option to just disable the ghost, so no timer and instant death. Making a mistake and then trying to correct it in a handful of seconds is just not fun for me.Other than that it's actually a cute game that broadens the line puzzle concept nicely. Discovering how the different enemies work and the imperfect levels forcing you to choose are clever additions.	----->	2
34096934	Ever wanted to just calm down and play some golf, but your too lazy to get up and actually play some golf? then here's your game. (And dont forget to buy a poop hat on the market, it helps.. definitely) 7/10	----->	0
34103252	Love the game! Please give us a Daily Challange! BARK, BARK!	----->	0
34103718	Really neat and polished crawler/puzzler/roguelike full of surprising mechanics. The quick sessions, semi-random dungeons, and a Spelunky-like progression allow a casual play without being too addictive (thank god). I was expecting a short iOS-style game but it keeps going: I'm 3 hours in and I still haven't gotten to the end (there is a story). Definitely recommended!	----->	1
34109892	This is an incredibly clever game. It's genuinely impressive that the creators have managed to make this concept into a working game. The complexity required to make a puzzle/rougelike that works and is consistently fresh each run is executed extremely well. The game never feels unfair, every mistake is something you can see in advance.It took me around 8 hours to complete the game in its current state, although I haven't done the extended challenges. There's definitely room for some more mechanics and ideas to be implemented, and I hope the devs are still planning on releasing a bit more content. Overall, it's a fun and short game, that doesn't get boring before you finish it. Also, bark at everything.	----->	7
34117502	It is a fun golfing game. It is the most realistic, sort of cartoony golfing games. I would recommend this game over Golf With Your Friends.	----->	6

34135916	I haven't seen many games with gameplay as polished as this one. The quick gameplay sessions allowed me to play it in my spare time, a thing I can't do with many games. If you don't have 60+ hours to put into a game but still want to enjoy a great experience, this is THE game to make that happen. Thanks for bringing this to life!	----->	6

34152484	A good game that could be better if they fixed a few things:-stay in party after a course is done-I noticed quite a few times on the first three courses that it wouldn't register that my ball stopped moving, so I would have to reset. I couldn't even do a hole one time because it wouldn't set the ball at the start-balls for opponents are extremely laggy and glitchy	----->	4

34161338	Tight design, nice aesthetic, well-tuned gameplay.	----->	3
34176971	Tentative recommendation simply because since the official release there seem to have been some questionable decisions made with regards to FTP progress, I will update this if my opinion changes on the matter. I purchased the early access package when this first came out and I loved it, it's something different for sure, you slap all your pieces on your vehicle and have at it to see how well you do. Now granted, I did spend some money on this when it first came out, so I haven't had any issues with currency so far. What i'm afraid is this is one of those games where it may be FTP but you practically HAVE to get stuff, so I'm going to have to keep playing to see if I hit a paywall I guess.TL;DR, I play this casually and enjoy it, it's pretty unique and the fast as hell rounds make any questionable balance things bearable. I'll change the update if I hit a paywall.UPDATE 6/11/19: IMBA like most of this dev's games but satisfying.	----->	-2

34208486	I don't like puzzle games, but this one is so deftly designed! Simple rules, great depth, some randomization to make it replayable, short sessions, lovely graphics - that's lot of positive elements, but believe me: Fidel adds these up to a much greater sum. Very cohesive and enjoyable experience.	----->	13
34208621	This game is a great pick up and play kind of experience. Each session might last anywhere from 5-15 minutes, it's great if you're sitting down with a laptop on your lunch break or waiting for a game to download. The music is catchy and the art style is fitting. Most importantly, the developer actually cares about his game. He's asking for recomendations from the fans, updating on a regular basis, and fixing bugs that arise in his game. The game is a solid reccomendation for anyone who likes challenging puzzles, and also for people who enjoy rouge-likes such as The Binding of Isaac.	----->	16

34217967	A simple but fun puzzle rogue-lite dungeon crawler. Prepare to die a lot, learning about the ghost and other enemy mechanics, but eventually you'll learn you have plenty of time to thoroughly consider your route on each level. Soon, you'll become experienced enough to rush through without dying, and beat the game on its normal difficulty, and that's when the real challenge begins! I haven't even beaten the unlockable hard mode, and with all of the secrets along the way, there is plenty of content to be had here, for a good price!	----->	-3

34275520	I have linked below to a video of my first twenty minutes in the game if you want to get a feel of what to expect.

At first the controls felt wonky, but if one researches the forums and discussion groups they will find ways to use alternate control schemes similar to Golf with Friends. I love to play this game and itis worth the buy!	----->	1
34472764	[i]Fidel[/i] is an excellent dungeon-crawling puzzler that respects the player's time. It loads nearly instantaneously and returns the player directly to their position at the previous logout without wasting a single second on menus or engine credits. The meticulously designed low-res graphics create an environment which enhances the gameplay mechanics without ever distracting, and the minimal scoring/survival system makes it easy to progress and hard to truly excel. [i]Fidel[/i] is a near perfect model for good game design and a fantastic momentary escape.	----->	13

34487080	Fun & quick game you and friends can spend countless hours in. I love this game over other golf/putt-putt games because you have to phcically pull back your mouse and slide it forward to swing the putter. With this mechanic, every hole will be played differently than the last time you played it. Game has Workshop support which is a must, gives you the ability to download 100s of awesome maps and even design your own. Absolutely recommend	----->	13
34524191	I have been playing this game since CBT. I don't normally leave reviews but with all the negative I got to say something. I personally think the game is amazing! It's a very grindy game. You can get everything from putting in many hours and have goals set. This isn't a pay to win. It's a pay to not grind. If you want stuff right now then you need real money. If you have time on your side and just enjoy playing the game. Just figure out the Power Score. It's a very fun game to play. You don't need the biggest vehicle with the biggest gun. Having a rare, epic, legendary or even relic gear doesn't matter. It's all about play style and being creative with your builds. I have logged over 900 hours into the game and don't have that many legendary weapons but I'm still having a ton of fun. Almost never use the legendary weapons cause it doesn't work for my play style and i make multiple builds every day.	----->	4
34530614	Totally worth the 9$. Pretty good Mini Golf Game, I played it with some friends and we had some funny\hilarious moments. :DBut watch out, this is a kind of game that breaks friendships!!! xDD	----->	7
34541938	I don't know what I can say about it, but I want to leave a positive review. It's a fantastic simple puzzle game, but if you want to be some crazy perfectionist and get all of the achievements, you can spend a lot of time figuring out the perfect route through all of the levels. I'm not that insane, but I spent what was probably too little money considering how long I played it.	----->	8

34560103	I enjoyed playing this game. I'd say I was probably playing the main content of it for about 7 hours. I really like the art and the music, and think they compliment the gameplay very well. When I first started playing, I was immediately interested because I did not find almost anything in the game to be filler/uninteresting. This lack of filler is great for very short play sessions, but I also enjoyed playing for 2 or more hours at a time.	----->	5
34560969	No idea how this fares as a single player experience, but with a handful of friends, loads of Steam Workshop custom courses, and most importantly COLLISION TURNED ON, it's a real barrel of laughs. It's become the perfect steam off-blower around the office with coworkers in the evenings.Mini-golf game-wise, it's no better or worse than any other, although the miniscule development team of 1 makes it a little rough around the edges sometimes. What makes it so interesting is the simultaneous play of all players in the multiplayer mode I mentioned, so you can be a dick and race to the hole, blasting others out of your way. That and the fact that all of the 18 holes have to be laid out on one physical course like real mini-golf means you can make all kinds of terrible shots that land in the green of another hole, which is hilarious.It's wanting of a little visual polish, and very much looks like a basic Unreal Engine game, but man it's good fun with friends.	----->	7

34566031	A really good sit down for 5 minutes to an hour game to play, with a very cute little doggo. It's challenging enough that it keeps me engaged, but easy enough that if it was a long work day, I don't have to think or work that hard to play. Also great for playing while waiting for queues to pop in other multiplayer games. 	----->	8
34579538	Minion Masters is my go-to game when I have a few minutes.If im expecting a call or waiting for a download or whatever. Minion Masters perfectly fill the gap. No more boring moments of waiting, pop in, play a round or 2 and continue your day.	----->	0
34599952	I'm having trouble finding a single issue with this game! It is easy to jump into and learn, but difficult to truely master. The gameplay is smooth and simple, while the strategy is complex and rewarding. While you CAN pay to unlock cards immediately, it is absolutely unnecessary. You can unlock anything through playing that you could buy, and I don't mean you have to grind 1000 hours to get them either, it is very reasonable when it comes to the microtransactions. The game places you in matches with similar level players so that no matter what, you're going to have a good time playing and not have to worry about someone ages ahead of you completely wrecking your life. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Duelyst, Hearthstone, or Battleforge back in the day. Also anyone who is interested in just trying something new. You won't regret it!	----->	1

34830940	This game has an amazing way of teaching you how to play. It manages to teach you the often subtle mechanics in a intuitive way, without forcing you to read long walls of text or sitting through tutorials: You play the game to learn the game. I did at no point feel like I didn't know how to proceed, something which I can not say for most other games.The core game is not that long (took me 5 hours to finish it all), but I still think the game is very much worth it. Additionally, as far as I am aware there still are a bunch of hidden easter eggs and challenges which I have yet to find/complete.	----->	7

34860614	I don't usually write reviews but I felt like I had to make an exception for this one.  If you like playing with a friend or preferably for this game, a small group of friends you're in for a treat.I bought this for myself and 3 friends and holy crap we had a blast. It's early access as of this review and I saw some people having technical issues, but none of us actually ran into any. The only thing was that one of our friends has a rather crappy computer and he would lag in our games. We figured it was his internet connection, but after looking at the forums and finding a post by the developers addressing this, he only had to turn down his graphics and everything was peachy.Turning collision on and playing this with a group of friends is probably one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had in quite a while. We were laughing and shouting so much! As of this review there are 5 18-hole courses with different themes. You've got the default grassy plains, winterlands, mines, graveyard and pirate maps. These are a lot of fun, well thought out and I could actually feel myself wanting to master them when not trying to screw over a friend.Then there are the workshop maps and we've only just gotten started on those. I can image that as this game gains popularity and players there will only be even more awesome courses to play and the potential here is great.Anyway, there's a reason I usually don't write reviews, I just blab out my thoughts as they come, but in any case I just wanted to leave a thumbs-up for this game. 	----->	7

35035935	Ignore the reviews with only a couple hours playtime... here goes.Finally acquires the perfect melee build(imo). Sets up a coordinated ambush... wait for it... BOOM! I get blown up by a cloaked explosive enemy melee build instantly! 9/10 would be blown again!Love the game, it is absolutely awesome. I was a huge twisted metal fan growing up and this has revitalized that vehicle combat genre I grew to love and then some. Lots of reviews just throw around that this game is pay to win. However you can't purchase skill off the shop... yes to be successful in Crossout, you will require skill. There's a learning curve here. Some catch on, some never do. Some just complain when the exploits players use get patched. So glad they actually address the exploits and patch them. Lots of strong pvp builds used to get rekt by the exploiters of particular build styles. So glad that sh!t is gone and its back to a skill based game. PROs:-nearly unlimited vehicle creation possiblity-Want cannons? Rockets? Machine guns? Mini guns? How about an auger or explosive spears? Better yet how about a rotating assembly off a combine harvester? They got em all!-Good updates, game is progressing and well thought out before they drop them.-Map diversity, some bigger some smaller, lots of nooks and crannies to keep you in cover or set up the perfect ambush.-Can play as fast burst damage combat, sniper, mid range support. Theres nearly endless fluid playstylesCONs:-Can be laggy at times, although this has gotten much better as of late.-in game voice chat is pretty much junk. Discord, problem solved :D	----->	14

35121890	TL;DR: The game is totally worth it if you are into golf games or simply want a good time pass game. With friends it just gets more fun. On sale you should definetly get this. You just need a fairly okay PC for this, something that can run 2010's games.Its a golf game, quite simple. There is a ball you hit it in the hole. Well, unlike other golf games, this doesn't have a power gauge, it depends on you that how hard you hit the ball, which is really fun! If this had a power gauge you could always memorise trick shots and always get a hole in one or two.This is quite taxing on the PC as this uses the unreal engine but the end result is a beautiful looking game. Another plus point of this game is that it has steam workshop support which of course allows you to share and download courses (maps) made using the in-game level editor.The devs are constantly taking feedback and listening to the community, they have added a few new maps and many tools in the level editor (the events thing being my favourite).Some people may have trouble looking for people to play this game but there is a dedicated Golf It! discord server which has almost a 100 people! I have linked the discord link in this review.Discord link: https://discord.gg/BU8d88H	----->	7

35131833	Never been much into deck building games before. Never been much into F2P games before.

35142304	More challenging than Golf With Your Friends because you don't have a meter for power. Simply pulling your mouse back and pushing it forward determines power.

35219340	Pros:This game is pretty awesome mini golf.  How hard you're going to hit your shot does take a bit to get used to but overall I really like the extra pressure it adds having to be precise with how far you pull back and the tempo at which you push forward with.  I enjoy all the base courses except for the one with cannons and teleporters. Personally I don't enjoy the cannon or teleporter mechanics.   The workshop also has a lot of really good courses, so there is a lot of good content here.Cons:Early access means there's still a few bugs in the game.  The only ones I have encountered have not been game breaking though, but I have lost a few strokes from the ball going in the hole and registering as out of bounds on occasion.  The UI also needs some work.  Chat can break between shots and holes.  No way to kick an afk player in the middle of the match. Overall: 8.5/10	----->	12

35338216	This early access game is very creative but it should give you more help on creating your own map because it is very unclear. The thing that really annoys me is when the public chat stops working mid game, i dont why but i just stops working. Needs to be fixed. It would be great to have voice chat so you can chat with people in game, but so it works and not stop working mid game. Unlike the game chat. It would be great if there was more game made maps because it gets a bit annoying when the custom maps lag, i dont like it. I would suggest this game to others its very enjoyable and should be a bit cheaper to say its early access, but other than that its a great game.Written Tuesday 7th November 2017	----->	8

35369324	Good game ALOT of fun to be had. Loads of user created maps to choose from. The handling is crazy and I'm still not used to it now although thats half the fun when playing with friends.	----->	6
35373679	Pretty fun game my friend got me into, although I've ran into a few problems with it including the collision just not working or just straight up on making me suffer and some of the floors dont actually move me. Great concept but i think theres more more needed here. Hopefully they don't abandon this game because it has plenty of potential for something as simple as a minigolf game!	----->	-3
35384961	Its pretty good huh?I love the game and i wont more like this	----->	9
35385774	this is a game about friendship and betrayal. 10/10 would lose my friends over a game with collision on again	----->	-2
35403435	Golf It is an absolutely thrilling game to play with friends. The fact that it allows its community to create maps and submit it in the workshop is a great merit to this game. Although GWYF was released earlier than this game, I believe this game is much more fun to play. I hope more people find out about this gem of a game so that it continues to grow much more.	----->	9
35404587	THIS GAME HURTS YOUR BRAIN	----->	0
35405921	Let me start off by saying that this game is amazing for a time to relax with friends. By no means is this game a single player or something to be enjoyed by yourself unless you enjoy something like the forge mode from Halo, because they do have a very well designed map creator. With friends is where this game shines. They have a wide variety of maps to download (subscribe to) in the workshop and well designed maps that come default with the game, along with scoreboards at the start up menu. All that being said, buy it for the freindship and relaxing golf setting, but stay for the more hardcore and challenging maps that you and friends are bound to have fun in.	----->	11

35420258	Purchased this game over the weekend was looking for game couple could play together. We both enjoy playing in the real world but was skeptical about planing on digital media.  Was pleasantly surprised by it. The courses are challenging paring up for a multiplayer match simple and well worth the 20 dollars total we spent for the game for two systems.  Highly recommend this game if you enjoy miniature golf and you can customize your game experience and your balls to different colors.	----->	6

35465060	If you like being heckled, frustrated, angry or love questioning life - then this game is for you. The fun and frustration is shared so you really come across some pretty funny experiences. It's a good mix of fun, strategy and multiplayer antics. This game is like Tiger Woods PGA Golf made for 5 year olds but you and your drinking buddies play it.	----->	14

35563457	I absolutely love this game. I play it at least a little bit, pretty much every day. :) The art is simply adorable - I love corgis! - and the whole vibe of the game oozes feel-good charm. I was also surprised by how much I enjoy the soundtrack. I've forgotten my strategy plans more than once, because I was distracted jamming out to the soundtrack. While the game *is* tough, and there's no tutorial to speak of, it's more than worth the effort to figure out and will keep you coming back for more.	----->	10

35578819	Great game. The strength you hit the ball with is determined by how hard you move your mouse. This makes it always a different experience cause its hard to hit the ball at the same speed everytime and causes some funny moments when playing with friends. The map editor with workshop support is a great addition to this games and adds endless maps so it wont get boring.	----->	11
35581272	Best game ever. It's so nice to play with friends. Just do it. Amazing game.	----->	3
35592460	remember how the gaming websites and magazines ( look at my name b4 u comment ) called mario kart and smash bros games that destroy friendships? this makes them look tame in an evil yet fun way.once you figure out the mouse putter this game can be easy.....if u are alone. with friends : damaged eardrums, damaged equipment, and damaged friendships.it is a great game....as long as you remember THIS IS A GAME!!!!7/10 ( still early access giving it room to grow!)	----->	1

35600074	Know what I love? How ignorant you are. You think you know the answers to the world just because you play a round of golf? Well let me tell you something. Golf doesn't even exist. It's meaningless gestures and motions that don't have any purpose. Maybe when you've gone to school and actually educated yourself, you'll understand what I do. You won't change a thing by golfing. Not one damn thing.	----->	-8
35604250	I play this game with a friends and vocal chat. I have to say that we are having a very good time playing, laughing and joking. The maps in the workshop are essentiel and some are actually really good.  However the menus require some optimisations but the game is still in early access so I'll still recommend this game.	----->	6
35604641	Gofl WIth Friends but better because it has a workshop, where users can submit custom maps and blueprints for others to play on. 10/10 I bought it fro two of my friends and we play it here and there, and every time is a new experience.	----->	2

35624467	Addicting! A little glitchy and buggy (what game in Early Access isn't?), but I rank it better than Golf With Your Friends if not only for the fact that it has Steam Workshop integration. Good way to blow off steam!	----->	2
35624637	While i know drones are broken, hovers have been in the concept since day one and im actually really glad that the devs added them in. The origional loading screen featured many cars that were not possible to build but now are thanks to the devs adding new parts and factions. On that note, balancing still needs to occur soon.	----->	5
35625630	Great game for something to do when your favorite games server is down or under maint, or if you are just bored and looking to have a little fun and relax. Have a battle of the courses currently with a buddy and we are having a blast. Its still has its bugs and qwerks but what early access game doesnt am I right? Havent played around with te course builder myself but i have played a few custom courses and they are pretty fun and see a lot of room for people to get crazy creative and look forward to seeing what the devs and people have in store for this game.	----->	8
35627430	Definitely worth if your friends buy it as well, jump in a voicechat and turn on collision.	----->	2
35631572	Very fun game especially with friends.	----->	4
35633607	i find that this is a great game to play with friends and to have some fun. Overall well put together the only problem is, is that most of the map creators are really bad at making maps and have no idea how to make a simple fudging hole. if only half the map creators would know how to make a decent map this would be a very good game. ALL BAD MAP CREATORS ARE BiMBOS	----->	0

35712171	Golf with friends is a fun, fustrating and frantic game.unlike other games with the same style this game invests in game knowlage rather than pure skill this is quite a nice feature as once you learn the skills shots it becomes quite rewarding.although these shots make the game alot more rewarding it is easy to look up a guide for these shoots ruining the game.overall 7.5/10	----->	3

36037826	Surprisingly good game, easy to get into, but has depth to keep coming back. Players play at their cards (minions) at the same time so there is no waiting for on your opponent like most ccgs which is an added bonus. Has a nice PVE option as well as 2v2s.	----->	8
36054218	It's fun to play and not expensive but it can sometimes lag. There's a lot of maps to choose from which makes it fun to play and you can build your own map.	----->	8

36086775	For a game that is priced  relatively low, it provides so much more entertainment and value than what's it's worth. The in-game matches are short and enjoyable with lots of different combinations of strategic play and cards/decks to always allow you to play every match differently as you see fit. Of course, this game is only in beta and there can only be more and more great additions that can be made to take the game to another level. Keep at it devs for continuous innovation of cards and all the good work that has been accomplished so far!	----->	10

36102151	Alltough I've only played three games of this so far I must warn you if you were headed to this game as a casual expecting an experience like Blacklight Interactives Golf With Your Friends you should go away because this is like Golf With Your Friends hard mode. [Spoiler] It does this with an innovative putting technique where the player has to move the mouse back and slam it forwards to hit the ball making it far more difficult than Blacklight Interactives old school method of having a charge table and a grid as a floor almost as if you were asking for sombody to make a spreadsheet for it. In conclusion the experience given from golf it so far has been great and I reccomend it for pros of the minigolf genre as it is not a space for casuals.[/Spoiler][NOTE] I will make future edits as the time I play this game goes on.First edit: added in spoiler warning for potential spoilers: 30/10/17	----->	0
36105431	Nice job on game! Good idea, good executed, there some things that need to be fixed( random bugs, glitch spots...) I would llike to see more officialy maps because they did good job with that maps. I personaly think that the game should cost around 5 euros. Anyway great game and I look forward too se it in full release!!! :)	----->	9
36107933	The IU needs a lot of rework imo, not really smooth and often laggy. But the game in itself is actually a tons of fun! + The ball customisation (hats/trails) really makes the game worth a try since you can sell everything you drop.	----->	2

36135457	Reaching almost 500 hours since OBT atm. I think I'm ready to write a review about this game, but most people won't like it.Overal, I highly suggest this game to everyone! Yes the game is a huge grind even if You are so called p2w player.There is no such thing as drone/turrets etc. problem, if You learn how to counter them. Most people who complain about this issue are Canon players who can't aim.Many people also will say that Hover builds have way too much armor, but they don't know what they are talking about. To put it in simple words at 10k+ Power score ground Vehicle easily can have 3000+ structure, where good Hover builds will have only around 1000. But even if people can't counter Hover builds, changes are coming to the parts and fairly soon I guess.People also are saying that weapons like spears are now useless against hover builds, but they might be surprised how effective they can be if mounted high enough to hit hover builds.Reading some reviews I also see that people are saying that after 3k+ PS drones and hover builds are ruling the battlefield. ALL of those people are wrong! as I said I have almost 500 hours in the game and 80% I played missions with 3,5k-4k PS and honestly if it's not for a 4man groups Hovers and drones was never a problem to Me personally!So now to my personal review and why I am making it positive!1. Ranked battles for competitive players! Yes it will take months to grind before You can participate and get in top 100, but it's possible, I personally only recently started to participate, so I would say that for ok player it will take around 400 in game hours before You can do good in Ranked battles.2. fast matches - PVP match only lasts 3 minutes, so You have to move around instead of camping! Many people still either camp, either suicide!3. skill to win! Yes many people think that there are a lot of cheaters in this game, but I don't think so! In my around 400 ranked battles so far, I haven't seen even once aimbot or anything from that sort. Yes there have been some lucky shots that got Me killed, but I haven't noticed visible cheating. It really takes skill and a lot of practice to do good in hover builds, specially combined with Tsunami canons!4. season missions - I completed every season mission since OBT start, it's a great way to earn a lot of crafting materials together with some containers. It used to be every week, now changed to every 2 weeks, means that You really need to spend only 1 hour a day in order to earn in 2 weeks a lot of scrap, wires, enough electronics and on top of that 1 rare and 1 epic part, which can be sold, meaning that around 400 coins every 2 weeks besides selling earned crafting materials.5. In game market - Market is an awesome feature that can help You if You use it right. Before a major update selling some of Your stuff will benefit You greatly, after new major update drops, quick buy/sell is a thing and can earn You a lot of coins in short amount of time. My quick example would be right after Dawns children update dropped I had 1300 coins on my account, new pack came out and people sold their Icarus hovers. I used that into my advantage and did a quick buy/sell with these hovers in first 2 days I earned over 2000 coins by just buying and selling these hovers.6. Brawls - Specificly The big black scorpions brawl, where everyone is equal and it all depends on Your personall skill.If You haven't tried it, try it and thank Me later.Overal Awesome game, still needs a lot of work at end game, simply because there are only 3 good building options currently for it. More works, but to do very good it's either Double Tsunami hover builds, Double Hammerfall builds or Tripple Spark builds. Drones etc. works too, but because they are passive builds it often leads into defeats. mandrake builds also work good if people know how to use them right, but then again skilled players normally know how to counter that.I could go on and on, but simply it takes a lot of time to learn the game, but when You do it's great fun and well worth effort!	----->	46

36335185	Played for a couple of hours. Game seems like its really well balanced, I won all 15 or so matches I had ranked. I also won a epic halloween skin so the odds dont seem too terrible for things.The game is fun. It reminds me a lot of Starcraft 2 Desert Strike. I love it.	----->	8
36337015	basicaly a better clash royale. no pay 2 win, singleplayer experiences, 3 different ladders with random 2v2, premade 2v2 and singles battles. only costs 0.49€ in sales or with coupons. the basic cards are strong enough to get through wood/stone/bronze and silver. (i'm in gold 1, i bet if i play a bit more i can reach the next league too with that) it gets frequent balance updates and new stuff. many freebies to grab. overall just a great experience... and the visuals are just awesome. it's so fun to see a big minion hit something small and have it flying off screen or against a building of the surrounding of the map. had many laughs with my friend already :)(oh and if you purchase, you get a 2nd copy to gift to a friend for free aswell)	----->	13

36436974	I was allowed to play this while in development but have made it to the finale and I think this is a very fun game. It provides a great challenge and I really like the style and gameplay, very unique and enjoyable. However, after completing it I felt content with setting it down. Really good for quick play sessions when you have some spare time, gradually improving each time.	----->	13

36495509	This game is fun.For how cheap I was able to get it, it was worth it.The recent econemy changes have made this game much less fun.Draft rewards are lack luster and the new expedition mode is slow and a gold sync.Even the expedition PvE battle are super boring becaues they made them super easy.On top of that they're pushing you to play expedition.Until changes are made and the recent changes are addressed I cannot recommend this game.(Edit 10 Dec 2018) Been playing for a few months now and besides some stale Grand Master decks this game is super fun and has come a long way! Totally would recommend this game to anybody. It's casual friendly at lower ranks if you're not looking for a super challenging experience.+1 to the Devs.	----->	22

36655902	Pros:- You start off with the most OP champion in the game.- Game has above average grahpics- Fun for the first few hours.- Has potential, but I sincerely doubt the developers can steer it into the right direction. Hopefully I will be delightfully surprised in the future.Cons:- Pay To Win- Leveling up in Ranked is incredibly easy, you stomp your enemy so hard you feel bad for them. This is the case until you reach a full stop. You get to a point where you just can't climb anymore because the tables turn and you get stomped instead.- Stomp or be stomped, the chance of finding an equal match is like finding a sasquatch.	----->	0
36685954	It's a virtual golf game that actually takes skill and you can screw up your friends shots so obviously 10/10.In all seriousness though, it needs some optimization graphically, i shouldn't be maxing out my RX480 on this game.But beyond that, and overall good time waster for playing with friends.	----->	3
36695738	This is a through explanation on the gameplay:It's like clash royale but more simple. You have no archer tower, you only have one king(master) tower. You can choose your king(master) from a variety of kings(masters) and each of them have their own different skills. Also your lane and the opponents lane are connected by bridges. You will have control over a bridge if your minion is the last one there(standing or passing over the bridge) and vice versa. Controlling the bridge will make you level up faster. Yes your king(master) have level. Everybody start on level 0 and will start gaining xp to level up with the max being level 3. Each king(master) will have 3 skills and you'll unlock your first skill on reaching level 1 and so on. Your king(master) tower have more HP than in clash royale. Also, unlike in clash royale, your cards dont have levels, meaning your opponent cant have an advantage of having higher level cards.TIP: This game is more of spamming your cards (units, spells, etc), because there's not that much space to let you strategize a lot (strategizing don't have that much of an impact on the gameplay, unlike clash royale). Also, unlike in clash royale, if you get swarmed, you'll most likely end up dead, so don't get swarmed. That's it.Overall, fun experience	----->	-2

37377494	For what you pay this game is well worth it. Graphically it’s beautiful, the selection of courses in the workshop will give you many hours of play time with some being harder and/or puzzling then others and the controls are straightforward but it takes time to truly master the ingenious system that is used. The only complaint ((really a gripe)) I have is that this game relies on you having friends to play with. You can play any course you have downloaded by yourself but this gets old fast. There is server selection so you can find people to play with but it reminds me of the old Uno online play. Some people either are just not playing, taking to long with shots or just being obnoxious in general making it an unpleasant experience. Overall I say buy it, its worth the few bucks just make sure you have someone else to play with.	----->	0

37569066	I... I don't even care much for golf IRL.Somehow this game is still so engaging, so enjoyable, so much fun! There is ridiculous potential in the game we already have here in Early Access. The level design is intelligent, the soundtrack is right on par (get it...? Okay, sorry), and the gameplay itself is responsive and in remarkable shape for what it is trying to accomplish. A lot of the unpredictability with making some shots is most likely due to an old mouse I'm using, but honestly I have never had the ball itself bug out.Golf It! is truly something special; you should definitely be a part of the experience.	----->	3

37604866	I've nominated this game for the ''the world is grim enough lets just all get along'' reward. I did this because obviously no combat or violence will happen within this rally of emotions. If those may happen outside of the game I did not say, as this game can break friendships apart in less than 15 minutes of playing together. So be warned, if you're the one getting f*cked over by your friends be ready to slam some desks. When you're the one f*cking over your friends, you will have a jolly good time though. In the end, you will lose track of time while playing this game, and you will have a great time if you've got some buddies to play with! 11/10 would break my mouse again	----->	1

37656335	I recently bought this game on a sale because its extremely cheap but I didn't expect the game to be this extremely good. Minion Masters is a fantastic fast paced card-based real-time strategy game. You will play as a minion master and you can choose from the nine different masters that has their owned respective perks to suit your gameplay style. You will build a deck of cards that have different minions on it. Each card has their own ability so they have their own different strengths and weakness. You need to strategically play your cards to gain an upper hand against your opponent. The first player to drain the other's health wins. Some says the game is pay-to-win but I disagree because you cant buy the cards directly. The game might provide an edge to the players who puts money on the game but it doesn't mean the game is entirely pay-to-win, it just makes their grinding a little bit faster compare to the others. Overall, Minion Masters’ fast paced and humorous, colorful style creates a bizarrely fun addicting game. It's still in early access right now so Im still expecting major improvements over the course of time.	----->	12

37752788	Best 49 cent I ever spent !I really didn't expect much from this game when I got it.Minion Masters completely took me by surprise. You are forced to duel against npcs or players on a small field. The goal is pretty simple kill the other duel master but it has a fair amount of strategy involved.Minion Masters is a very impressive early access game with a lot of potential.I have only played the game for 14 hours and it has already become very repetitive.The game only has a handful of masters and cards to pick from. Minion Masters only has one map with a few different settings for me this is the games biggest problem.Addressing and fixing the lack of maps for this game has to be the first step.Adding new masters and cards will also be a key issue mainly will players be forced to buy these cards or not.Hearthstone is a major card based game but buying cards is a big part of the game.Minion Masters will have to decide if they will also force players to spend real cash to obtain those cards or not.Hearthstone will say players can earn those cards but they go so far out of thier way to restrict those players.Hearthstone puts out insane OP quest on hardest setting with new OP cards just to force players into buying.Hearthstone restricts players progress to further force them into buying cards.I realy enjoy Minion Masters but if turns into a cash grab like hearthstone I won't stick around.Giving players the option is fine as long as they don't start restricting and punishing players for not buying cards.Minion Masters needs to add new bigger maps with new objectives and ways to fight then a few masters and cards.Early Access so hopefully will we see a lot of new content in the future.	----->	1

37765707	I wish I hadn't recently been laid off, or else I would have put more money into this game.Not that you have too, considering most of the top tier decks all use the basic cards and free champ ;).This game is one of the best definitions of balanced games. Like wow.As long as you understand the cards and strategies behind them, this game is incredible.It's not too difficult to get cards, I think that could be worked on a bit.Otherwise, great fun game.In 2 days, made it to Master Tier in Ranked without spending any extra or having that awesome premium upgrade.Also, if you stream you can ocassionally giveaway free copies of the game.I usually stream after 9PM EST, if you wanna give it a go :)	----->	18

37780296	This game was OK. Just OK. The music were pretty stale, not fun and not boring. The courses went from easy to hard at random, no inbetween pretty much. There's nothing special about these corses so don't expect too much. On the Pirates map it stopped being minigolf, play the game and see what I meant. Around 1 hour to play trough all the maps and courses. The enviroment and graphics were lovely on the first and second map, grassland and the winter one.The online weren't pretty much there, some active games with passwords.I personally doesn't like the controls, I prefer having a power bar or such that shows you how hard you hit last time. In this game you hit randomly hard or soft, on feeling. Please, make some more enthusiastic music and look trough the courses difficulty.Only one map (the one with many holes in the mines) were anti-free cam, the rest you could just free cam trough without any hazzle. Some maps you gave players a choice between left and right, it has no meaning because of the free cam and also because the choices were identical, this is really bad for the course interactivity.I only recommend this game because it has potential to become better.	----->	12

37836055	Golf It is a multiplayer mini putt game that's a lot of fun to play with friends.Pros- Mimicks real world mini putt but with crazier holes than you can find in real life.- Swinging your putter by moving your mouse back and thrusting it forward is great.- Tons of custom maps due to the powerful level editor and the active community.- Simultaneous play and collisions between balls makes for a fun time with friends.Cons- Not able to reconnect to a match in progress if you're disconnected due to connection issues.- Level editor is powerful but lacks a couple of essential features (like Undo/Redo functionality).	----->	11

38035300	Back when I first played in closed beta the game was very unbalanced and weapons and other needed items were nearly un obtainable unlss you were super rich. Combat was scary due to the unbalanced weapons and power scores and was nearly impossable even for a closed beta player like me to get a match victory. I ended up re downloading the game again after a long break from the game and lots has changed and for the better. The combat is far more balanced and the price for weapons and such has been reduced to a more real cost that wont bankrupt you. My friend and I have come to love the game again and have been spending much more time on it. Remember kids, its about the build you make not the weapons you toss on it.	----->	2
38042933	At first I thought the game is worth the 99 Cents I paid for it and not even one cent more. Wrong! The game is great. You can either play it as a filler if you got some minutes OR for hours in one session. The different masters offer different playstyles. And with different I mean different and not like one style to play. You can basically have success with a lot of combinations and if something feels too imbalanced its getting rebalanced pretty quickly. Content updates are regularly coming. You can either play 1on1 or 2on2 with a random or as premade group (different ranks). Even tho I think the newest addition to the game, which is some sort of half exploration/half PvE thing isnt that great, the game in total still rocks.10/10 for that price	----->	7

38056744	I was cautious and skeptical about purchasing this game, considering it's early access and my poor experiences with them. However, I was blown away by this game.

38166838	It's very good. It's not sokoban, it's not hitman-go, puzzles are different every time and it's the kind of game where you can drown in nuance and depth.	----->	0
38201225	When it launched, this was a game with loads of charm, a few hidden delightful surprises, and a brutal difficulty curve. With the recent 2.0 update, the ramp up from zero is a lot smoother and (frankly) more fun. There's also a ton of new stuff to do, surprises, and novel permutations of the core ideas. It went from being a game I rather enjoyed but gradually grew bored of, to one of my favourites of the year.	----->	0
38218035	This one is kind of a mixed bag. The controls aren't as friendly as Golf With Your Friends, but the hilarity when you accidentally blap a ball outside the map definitely makes up for the lack of granular control.In short, this game is fun, should not be taken seriously, has loads of content (a significant amount more than Golf With Your Friends), and is fun to play with your friends. Fantastic for drunk Friday nights!	----->	3

38243886	Not very competitive as it's very easy to hit high ranks in under a day of grind due to the player base and ranking system with win streaks.

It is carefully designed to reward your time and attention and respect your intelligence. It's relaxing without being boring and fun without being childish. And on top of that it's full of warmth and charm. In a better world this clever and faithful hound would be the centerpiece of a vast media empire, a global pop culture icon.

38426156	This game is only 9 bucks at full price and it's worth it. The custom map editor means that there are always new maps to try, due to the active community. Turn on collision, when playing with friends, for a silly time. Since you shoot simultaneously, running into each other (on accident or on purpose) becomes a whole thing.	----->	-1
38430472	Unlike the many other tower/card games out there on the market, Minion Masters comes with a refreshing take on the genre without the endless progression/paywall that you see on many app style games. The game is rather generous at providing the coin necessary to get another power token for an additional card. Also, the cards once found are none upgradable. That means a person spending cash cannot wipe a person to the floor with their upgraded versions.There is 1v1 and 2v2. There is also expidition mode where you bring a chess piece around the map for additional gold and cards by using supply points received by leveling up and fighting battles.Balanced, fun, easy to pick up with a high skill ceiling, loving it!10/10	----->	5
38430509	Golf It! What can I say? Out of all the golf games on the steam catalog, this game takes the cake! Polished, graphically pleasing and a plenthora of player created maps on steam workshop, you'll be playing with friends and enjoying yourselves for hours upon hours of content.The game also has customization options for the balls including hats and trails.A must have for mini putt fans.	----->	2
38434612	A really good thorough puzzle game that is easy to play and hard to master. The graphics are very cute, the level design is strong and the extra modes are good fun. Definitely worth getting at full price as it isn't that expensive for a lot of content!	----->	10

38563041	This game was a lot more roguelike then I expected, very fun and challenging at the same time. I also enjoy learning how to face enemies and bosses without the game holding my hand.

38564519	Choosing between catchphrases for this game:- 50% hearthstone, 50% Dota, 100% fun!- Hearthstone, eat your heart out!- Move over Hearthstone!I bought this game on sale for 49 cents, figuring if I hated it, I wouldnt even bother having to return it.Instead, I was instantly hooked. I'm currently considering buying a bundle before they go off sale.Pros:+++++++++++++++++++ Familiar but legallydistinct characters+ Announcer has good (not great) voice acting+ Fast load times+ Fast match queues+ Holiday events in Beta?!+ low low price of 50 cents!!!+ Simple to learn, difficult to master+ Totally original gameplay+ Auto loads bug forums when crashing+ Can play game with one hand, eat cheetos with the other.Cons-----------------I crashed once, the game recommended lower settings, and suggest I report the bug, taking me to to the bug report forums.- Graphics and interface could use some polish (my biggest complaint so far)- Game should auto generate/submit logs regarding crash, for Quality assurance.- Will probably go free to play after release	----->	0
38582663	I haven't played it for long yet, but so far I like it! I'm playing 2.0 which is supposedly a bit easier, but it's still quite hard (for me), a real brain teaser. I just managed to beat the first boss and play on a bit further. I'm sure there's lots more to learn as I haven't even figured out what the bark is good for yet. It's interesting how the levels are procgen but still retain a theme, so it's different yet familiar each time you play. Also I like the pixel art, it's clear and good.	----->	9
38597952	Quick review: Definitely worth the price. Works well on my modest laptop with the quality settings lowered. Twitchy controls can be tweaked in settings to make them feel more natural, so that's good. Multiplayer works well. No dedicated single player mode, but if you start a lobby for one player you're good to go and practice on your own. I haven't tried the editor yet, so can't say much about that.Feedback for devs: * The ball feels like it takes too long to stop. A slight tweak to the physics would be welcome. * An up and down option on the free camera would make navigating the camera less awkward.	----->	8

The game features local multiplayer, online multiplayer using a server browser system, customizable game modes and items, and Steam Workshop support for an unlimited number of custom maps to enjoy.Definitely worth a buy at the normal $9 price tag, a no-brainer on sale.	----->	11
38639323	its good	----->	3
38639813	Like a good puzzle game, just when you think you understand all the rules the game throws a twist.The game is hard and contemplative, but never slow. The replayability here is really, really high.This product is exactly what it says it is -- a zero grind puzzler with perfect pacing.Best of all, this game deeply respects the player's time. Buy it now.	----->	5
38656506	Very fun game, as far as card games go the pay-2-win is almost non existant (just get more cards) and all cards, including starting cards, are viable.Favourite thing: Physics in the game are spot on. When a Golem smashes a person he goes flying.Worst thing: Small playerbase. Sometimes low ranks team up with / verse high ranks.In conclusion, definitely worth picking up especially on sale.	----->	6

38707148	Golf It!Golf It is really good golf game. It has the same idea as golf with your friends. This one has better graphics and souds. Golfing itself is easy and simple, you only have to use your mouse to hit the ball. There are a lot of levels to play through and you can make some by yourself, which is really nice! One difference between golf with your friends and this is that golf with your friends has more players and in this game you will get kick out of the lobby so many times. It is hard to play with random people. Overall this offers really fun and nice times. Grade: 7/10	----->	10

38716316	It's as good as it promises. Quick play sessions with (at least for me) difficult challenges makes for a satisfying game to play for <30 minutes, or longer when you're doing some other low attention thing (eg reading an article or listening to a podcast eg). When you're afk you can also think about the game and get new ideas for next time (or just keep playing when you want). It's quite addictive and very polished (the art, sfx and ui is quite good, and it doesn't glitch or crashes afaik)With the content updates so far (chirstmas 2017) I feel it's worth the full price tag I payed: 9€ EUR	----->	4
38727344	Fidel dungeon rescue is a great example of an underated game, it's amazing! Fantastic! And it's shocking that not that many people have heard of it. The first time I played through it, I found the game to be a little too unforgiving, 9 times out of 10 I wouldn't die from a mistake I made, but from moving the wrong way by accident...But thanks to the update, the game is less unforgiving, there's loads of new content, bug fixes, and little things that were polished up, like some of the animations, effects, and even gameplay.I'd say it's totally worth the price, I thought it was high at first, especially for the game before the update, but now it's a better match for the price. I definitly recommend picking this up if a rogue-like puzzle game sounds fun to you.	----->	10

38843303	Easily one of the best strategic experiences I've had in a while, despite still being in EA. Ideally it will have some better training and dummy modes in the future, the Expeditions will get fleshed out a lot, and there will be some balance passes (why can people mirror their teammate in doubles? :V), but the game is just really, REALLY good. Plus, at the time I write this it's on sale for a staggeringly dumb 50 cents, so there's just shy of no reason NOT to play it. Go sell a handful of trading cards from other games and get this one. 9/10. :P	----->	0
38845607	I am loving it even after spending a very long time watching it and golf with your friends on youtube. My only question is how do you or can you yet, find custome maps already made? Not to mention the people in chat are very nice and helpful. I did have a problem getting my chat tab to show up for a while but it works now so I'm happy.  con... lil slow on load during peak gaming hours and dunno how to find the custome maps yet but thats it. 9.5/10	----->	3

38908413	I have to say that I own both Golf It! and Golf with your friends, so here's a little comparison between [b]Golf It![/b] and [b]Golf with your friends[/b]:[h1]Golf It![/h1][b]PROS[/b]➜ The power that you hit the ball is measured by the movement of your mouse, which means that you have more control over the power that you put on the ball, also means that the shots become more skillfull rather than with a power bar like Gof with your friends;➜ It has workshop and a level editor, which means it has loads of different levels to try and create;➜ The physics are great.➜ Ball customization is alright, it doesn't have loads of different customs but probably they will keep adding some.[b]CONS[/b]➜ The lack of more mods that you can put into the game, like different shapes, ball jump and many other aspects that Golf with your friends has for example;➜ The loading screen is quite annoying, it takes so long to load into the game when you open it (although I have to say that when you start a match there's almost no loading time), I decided to put in the cons because it could be improved.[h1]Golf with your friends[/h1][b]PROS[/b]➜ It has loads of in-game mods that you can add to each match to make it way more fun;➜ The physics are quite good, but not better than Golf It!;➜ Ball customization is great, it has different colours of trails and loads of hats.[b]CONS[/b]➜ It does not have workshop, which is a shame for the developers for such a good game like Golf with your friends;➜ Lack of new maps, caused by not having workshop![h1]Conclusion[/h1]Don't get me wrong, both games are so much fun and they are really great games. I am just trying to help those who are in doubt between those two games. I would get both if possible, because some features lack on each game.🎮7.5/10 on both games🎮	----->	12

38983208	This game is way more fun than it really should be when you have a group of friends over.  Ball collision physics need some work though.  Try to hit enemy ball on left side to make it go right, but I hit enemy ball on the left side and make it go left into hole.  That was a sad day.	----->	-4

39052386	As one who has never been to fond of this type of game, I find it very enjoyable.Queue times are short in any of the three game types. Each of the Masters have their own cool little perks that can help you win a battle.There's a lot of variety when it comes to cards, and it isn't too difficult to get new ones.Personally, I enjoy the 2v2 aspect the most, but 1v1s are fun as well. I definitely recommend getting this game with a friend if you want to get into something for a few hours.	----->	17
39059137	Saw this from youtubers and didnt think it would be that fun.I bought it and i can say that it is a lot of fun with your friends.It's a great party game goofing around with your friends.Even taken seriously it's a really great game although a very simple one.Golf it is a great game for someone that doesnt want to spend much money but have a lot of fun.	----->	14
39060985	The only problem with the game is that they score golf incorrectly.	----->	-2
39066663	really good	----->	3
39070061	Awesome game. Having the game be mostly based on Workshop items is awesome. It beats Golf With Your Friends because of that aspect. Controls are fine and easy but it does take a few rounds to understand how hard you have to hit it.	----->	2
39094260	This game needs friends. I'd only recommend this if you have a group of friends you play with often. It's not much about golfing but about having fun with your friends. It's very enjoyable, with the right moments and with a lot of laughter with your friends. The custom maps (community made) are great, most of them are of great quality. You have fun levels where you and your friends can be real competitive mini golfers as well as being in a level where you're just waiting on your friend to come around the corner to hit him back to the front of the hard part he took 10 hits to hit. It brings Steam inventory items as well, you can customise your ball with hats and colours, all being funny, classy, presidential or scary. It's definitely worth buying. It would also be nice if there was a 4-pack available so you could buy it a bit cheaper for your friends.	----->	19
39104878	this is a great game with friends especially since i got it on sale, i bought some for friends and we love it. as it stand you have to set your mouse to higher dpi (sensitivity) to be able to have control or hit your ball really hard as required sometime. had a few friends complain about the controls since its such a delicate balance, but i love it and most my friends do too	----->	6

39162195	Excellent game with high replay ability. Expect bugs obviously because of Early Access, but my friends and I have had few issues. My 50+ hours have been playing with friends over the internet, so I don't have any experience with playing games with random people.Pros-High replay ability. In 50+ hours I have never replayed the same map. It's not to say maps weren't fun, I've enjoyed almost every one, but there are so many great maps being made all the time.-Nostalgia. It has the fun and feel of traditional miniature golf with the bonus of having different putters and jumping.-Vibrant Settings. The colors and design of the game take the cake for me. The textures are all well made and the whole thing is very pleasant to look at.-Course Editor. This will probably be what keeps this game intensely popular. A strong base of designers.Cons-Steam achievements for building courses. I wish there was a better way to have a reward for designers. Although I haven’t come across it yet, it seems like this could look to people churning out 20 mediocre maps just to 100% the game. Maybe give them achievements based on how long they have a 5 star rated course or something.-When my mouse view is far away from my ball which is behind a wall and my view shows a see through version of the wall. I don’t know if that’s ever helped anyone because it’s too difficult to see through still. Maybe have the mouse force a view to where the player can’t scroll back through the wall.Possible Additions-Nudge. I can't tell you how many times I've been 1 pixel away from sinking a putt; if nudge can be added as a custom map option like jumping I think it would add to it.-Teams. It would be fun to add a team mode so 2v2, 3v3, etc. can happen. It doesn't really add anything to the game other than adding an additional competitive element.-Prioritize Steam friends servers over random servers, even if those servers are overseas. I play with a friend who lives very close (in the USA) and another friend who lives in England. I usually host the maps because when he hosts them it makes it a bit more difficult to find.-Alphabetize the custom maps when hosting a server. I understand that the most recently downloaded map goes to the bottom, but just making it alphabetical would make finding multiple newly downloaded maps easier.Overall OpinionIgnore everything I've said above and keep doing what you are doing. The game is excellent.	----->	25

39347196	I reccomend this game. I actually bought three copies for my friends.Graphics are mehOptimisation isn't that greatBut, physics is pretty good, mechanics are solid.

39349169	Pretty good so far, met some great people :)Had a really good first experience.As far as my experience goes, the community is alright.If you want a game to play with friends this is the perfect game for you :)	----->	13
39358178	I first received the Humble Original version in Humble Monthly and enjoyed the early version. The current version feels more complete and a bit easier to learn, although I'm still struggling with the dragon boss. Game mechanics are learned through trial and error. Puzzles are randomly generated, but have multiple solutions. However, only good solutions will level you up enough to beat the latter bosses. If you like line puzzlers, then I'd definitely recommend this.	----->	6

39455229	EDIT: Since this review Minion Masters has become one of my favourite games of all time as you can probably tell by the fact it is my most played game.Though it has it's faults, I'd highly recommend just giving it a shot and seeing how you enjoy it. The game has a great Twitch community to go with its twitch integration and gold drops.-EARLY ACCESS REVIEW-So far, sooooooo good.This easy to pick up, difficult to master collectible card game is fast paced, frantic and FUN. The games last a maximum of about 8 minutes so losing doesn't feel like a waste of time and there are plenty of progession rewards to hold your interest.There are currently 2 ways to play: 1v1 and 2v2. I personally prefer 2v2 but enjoy both.There is also an expedition mode, but that is currently being changed in some way by the devs.As the game is currently in alpha, there will obviously be a lot of changes, improvements and additions, but you currently have a very playable game that will hopefully just continue to get better!	----->	10

39518163	Got this Title on steam sale, thinking why not its only a couple bucks.I purchased a year ago, still playing and still enjoying.The game is great for 2 players or solo, 2 players the deck building can be really fun for strategizing.Overall I do recommend this title, if it wasnt on a steam sale I would still buy it.	----->	9
39550731	Golf It! is the best golf game out there right now. The default maps are pretty good, but where the game really shines is with the custom maps available on the workshop. The power control, actually swinging the mouse, also makes it a lot more skill based than many of the other golf games.All and all, this game is easily worth $9 as it is now.	----->	6
39581866	This game is annoying, which is good. 7/10 -Still has some bugs that won't let me play sometimes. But the music is amazing and it feels relaxing; unless your playing with another person and losing like me... FeelsBadMan.	----->	3

39610499	Overall a very fun game, although I've only played it with my friends so I don't really know how it would be to play it alone. I've got mainly a couple of issues with the game itself, first one being that sometimes the scenario turns black (you need to change the graphic settings in order to fix that) and it get pretty annoying. The second problem is that it happens pretty often that I can't shoot with my mouse because it gets stuck and it really drives me crazy because I'm not doing anything wrong. Finally I'd REALLY like a macOS version of this game so I can play it on my MacBook, thanks.	----->	1
39648363	Manages to combine game genres that one might doubt would work together at all. Contains an astonishing amount of content, without even factoring in its very high replayability. An absolute must for puzzle lovers.	----->	-1
39652568	I'll try make this simple and short..  This game is really fun and addictive and deserves a much larger playerbase. The devs are constantly listening to player feedback and bringing out regular updates to address the concerns of players.For an early access game its very well refined and offers alot of value for its price.  Aslong as the devs continue their hardwork and keep bringing out new content and making changes based on good feedback it will definetly grow.	----->	7

39698285	A wonderful rouge-like that makes you rack your brain and have fun while doing so. The graphics do their job well of creating dark, gloomy asmospheres and the monsters are well distinguished so you can remember which monsters do what. The soundtrack is amazing and the different dogs you can play as are very fun. This game's a lot more accessible thanks to 2.0 and is a blast to play. The many modes are unique and interesting in their own ways. 8.75/10	----->	14

40216370	Im liking this, its one of those games you chill and play. Its fun with random people and even more so with friends. I chose this over Golf with friends because of the workshop, and im not dissapointed. Theres a ton of content to play with. Theres also a lot of cool cosmetics to earn. If you want to play with random people, just make a title like Public match or something and wait. Its not the best game, but for 4$ its a fun game thats different than every game basically on the steam store. I would reccomend at 4$ on sale, at full price i think it would be worth but 4$ is a steal. Its a good fun timewaster. Reccomend 7/10	----->	24

40258236	8/10, could be better if when my game disconnects for no reason, i dont lose rank points. but this is a really solid game that can go places. Its simple yet full of strategy.

40468656	Review changed to Positive. Whilst I still maintain that the game was better prior to Update 60; that I have continued to play after the update means that it's still doing something right to keep me coming back from time to time. I can acknowledge that my previous review may have been a little kneejerk. Never the less, I still long for the days where the game was a little more cartoonish with a larger deployable area for greater and more flexible unit interactions. All that said, the review has been changed to Positive, and the previous review shall remain as is below for posterity.---While I truly enjoyed this game, Update 60, 'The Visual Rework Update' has ruined my enjoyment of the game.The Visual Rework has made the game more crisp, and defined with deeper blacks and shaper edges. As a result, the game has lost its cartoonish charm. Update 60 also changed the viewing angle and warped the players sense of unit sizes that we've become accustomed to. Its also introduced a wierd imput lag that feels like some sort of Vsync that is over compensating.As such, I no longer enjoy playing this game. It is my hope that Update 60 gets reverted.	----->	4
40480360	It's a great game. Sort of feels like Clash of Clans mixed with Hearthstone, but unlike Clash you don't have to wait a few hours to open up your card pack. It has different rarities for cards, but the rarer cards arent overpowered and you can make  a perfectly fine deck with just the base cards and common ones you get from packs. The 'Legendaries' are fun to use but like I said, they aren't necessary by any means. They are updating the game quite regularly (about once a week) and in the newest patch they made some balance changes and a visual rework that wasn't too extreme but the game feels much better to play. The devs are constantly taking feedback and working to improve the game.	----->	20

40490181	[list][*][b][h1]Morlan's shorts:[/h1][/b][/list][b]Fairly original concept on an old theme[/b] this cannot-step/cross-twice-on-path gameplay. It's feels well programmed, responsive input, striking and well drawn graphics/animations, nice accompanying music, fitting and pleasant sound effects! My only drawback is that [b]there isn't an option to lower volume[/b] but only completely mute music/sfx which probably is a mobile port leftover. Yes it looks like a mobile port (I don't know if it is) but is just as suitable for a PC (yeah whatever Linux persons/MAC droids! :p ..you too if it supports it) Bit pricey but if you can afford or during a sale/bundle, thoroughly enjoyable![b]Don't waste more time reading lengthy reviews.. time is of the essence![/b]	----->	11

40502830	Have you ever wanted to play miniture golf with your buddies, but they live too far away?  So many devs had the same question, and so many did a good job, but this one is my fav.  So buy it and support a great dev team.  10/10 would smack my friends balls again	----->	8

40574981	This is a great indy game! It is simple but fun strategy game. There are many fun and unique minion and masters that the player can choose. It is nice to see that the devs are taking good care of this game and that are always trying to make it better. Even if you do not like card or strategy games I would recomend this game! This is a better version of Clash Royale for the computer.	----->	23

40623357	I won this game in a giveaway someone was doing. I thought the game was cute at first glance, but I wasn't expecting much. I don't know why it is, but man, I'm kind of addicted now. Fidel has wormed himself straight into my heart. The puzzles are addicting and new every time, you learn to defeat the monsters through observation and experiment, and there are quite a few cool secret levels to discover! (Not sure if I've found them all yet.) I am just in love with this game now. It just makes me smile.	----->	12
40624112	Extremely fun game. Only problem is I stuggle to stop playing it (very addictive)	----->	1
40655148	Hella fun and not pay to win.  The game offers a lot of different options allowing for varying styles of gameplay, and has a really nice community that is not toxic.  It also has an ingame marketplace that lets you sell your items, so you dont ever have to pay for them with real cash if you have the stomach for a long grind.  The match making service also will put you against other players that are equal in terms of defense and attack scores, so you dont have to worry about someone who pays a lot into the game totally shredding you into bits.  I highly recommend.	----->	1

40800482	Good game that makes you approach the levels intelligently. For some, the ghost will ruin the experience, so here's a tip: To disable the ghost: Press SHIFT-CTRL-F3... if a thunder happens, go to the menu and restart. You can push it again to reset it. I think a lot of people who would dislike the game with the ghost will like it a lot more without it.	----->	-4

40974052	This game is excellent and you should play it. That's really the key insight here.It's a puzzle game where you try to optimise the collection of resources in a map without dying or crossing your path. It's got interesting mechanics. It's got cute art. You are a dog. There is a button that makes you bark. You can press the bark button as much as you want.Play this game.	----->	7

41126061	Got the game on sale, which to be honest is probably the only reason I am giving this a thumbs up. Get it on sale or if you like this type of game.I never encountered any bugs and waiting for other players never took longer than 30secs. Wide range of units, most of which I never unlocked, but I think that is because I am a very casual player.It's not bad, but wait for it to be on sale	----->	4

41242941	=========UPDATE3 NOV 2018=========It's a good game. I just wouldn't make it a main golf game to play since it sometimes lags or the render quality slows down.Rating: 8.5/10.0	----->	1
41269741	It's really friendly for casual and new player. There is no card level or tower level so anyone don't have unfair advantage. And you can craft literally every card in the game so you don't have to rely chest system and hoping to get lucky. There is also countless combination of card and hero's ability you can mix. So if you're bored you can try a new strategy.	----->	1

41311157	Minion Masters is basically a mmorpg PVP card and tactics all in one game where you pit your monsters against your apponents.  I would say its more like Electronic Arts mail order monsters on Steroids. Reason I have not reviewed this game from the time I bought it was to give the company plenty of time to fix issues that involve modifications, things I like to do with my games. Id like to thank them for not banning me too. Its highly appreciated.When it comes to modifying a game, NEVER modify a mmorpg. It can get your game banned, and possibly your steam account too. Only reason I modified it, was because when I purchased the game at the time, it was a cheap game I got with one of those 90% off coupons, and wasnt advertsied as an online game. When I tried it the first time around, I got slaughtered so made my modifications, and slaughtered every boss monster that was thrown at me. It wasnt till I got a message in the chat window I was going to be reported, that I found out I was actually playing against another player. I quickly contacted the company and asked for a reset. After that, they replied, and I gave them all information on what I had done so as it can be fixed so no one else does the same. [b][h1]Minion Masters is a great game. As you level up, you get rewards to modify what you have, or just buy new things from the store as well. There is even a shop to buy things with real $$ if you choose to, but its not required to play the game. This game is not single player, so please do not modify it thinking it is. When you play, other than the statyup tutorial, your playing against other players and its important to play honestly. The game is worth the money wether 90% off or full price. Have fun =)	----->	21

41439731	If you like the idea of a psychological battle of deduction, deception, and hiding in plain sight then SpyParty is the game for you.After 5 years and thousands of games played, each one is just as tense and exciting as my first. This is a deep, competitive game with real potential as an e-sport.In my time with SpyParty it's come a long way, with new missions and features, and a complete art overhaul with 10 maps and 21 characters. The game continues to improve and the future looks bright, with a lot more content and polish planned. The developers are incredibly responsive to feedback, and are constantly listening to suggestions and making the improvements that players want.SpyParty's community is also fantastic, with veterans who are much more interested in helping new players learn the game than beating them! There are regular leagues and tournaments that anyone can take part in, and livestreams where casters analyze the games between top players.	----->	12

41440698	Awesome game, a rare gem in todays world of micro transactions and factory made video games, Spy party is a unique 2 player strategy game. The game takes place at a party, complete with plenty of party goers, but one of these people is the spy! One player plays the spy, whose objective is to complete certain missions without being spotted. This is where the sniper comes in. His role is to look over the whole party from his sniper nest and monitor the guest, and look for anything fishy. If he see something .....Boom...people get dropped.This is a great two player game, the online works great, and its great discussing each game afterwards using the replay system. 8.7/10	----->	7

41441931	Интересная и веселая игра, правда расслабиться здесь будет трудновато. Если играть за снайпера, то нужно постоянно следить за всем, анализировать ситуации, держать в голове различные игровые моменты, например где какие статуетки должны стоять (их может быть от 1 до 8), можно конечно не париться и надеятся на удачу, что увидишь своими глазами саму подмену, но лучше не стоит. Шпион может неплохо отыгрывать бота и если он освоился в игре, то отличить его будет очень сложно от других. В зависимости от режима игры шпион должен выполнить определенное количество заданий, но его время ограничено, и если он будет не успевать, то ему придется рискнуть и перевести часы. Если снайпер заметит что время увеличилось и сможет верно предположить кто из стоящих у балкона или окна смотрел на часы, то шпион будет убит) Помимо этого есть еще масса других заданий которые нужно выполнять, присутствуют например режимы выполнить 3 из 5 заданий, ботов может быть много и всё это только усложняет игру снайперу, но шпионом играть тоже не легко. Нужно отлично отыгрывать обычного бота и незаметно выполнять задачи либо вовремя споймать момент и ввести снайпера в замешательство, после чего он убьет вообще не того и проиграет. Также довольно дружелюбное коммьюнити в игре. В общем рекомендую	----->	0

41453646	This game is everything you could ever ask for in a spy scenario game. Its competitive, deceptive nature adds for exciting games leaving you on the edge of your seat. I reccomend for any gamer to pick this up and give it a go. 25$ is a steal for a game like this. Buy Buy Buy!!!	----->	3
41453811	I've been waiting for SpyParty for quite some time, and now I finally have it, I can't say I'm disappointed.It honestly isn't like any other multi-player game I've ever seen. The tension is incredible, knowing (if you're the sniper) you only have one shot to get it right, or (as the spy) one false move can see you shot.Even now the community is very friendly, and although the game is still a little rough around the edges, future plans look amazing.Play with a friend, play with a random, either way, you're going to have a ball.	----->	1
41453930	Great competitive game and such a fresh idea! Convinced my brother to buy this today and had such a great time with it, it really is fun and if you like challenging someone (1 vs 1) this game is great! Love it! Great tutorial to get you going! The competitiveness of it rivals that of any good strategy based board game. The little details make this work of art something I’ll challenge my brother to for as long as the Lobby exists! Could be my brother and my new alternative to a chess match, and much faster! Get it!	----->	14

41457632	Review:I’ll skip the long intro, there’s plenty of very apt descriptions for the game; if the initial pitch doesn’t sell it to you, you probably want more info  so here’s a few pros and cons. Also, for the record, the game’s been out for a whiiile before Steam, so don’t mind my logged hours. I’ve... played some games. 6.5 k of them.The pros:-	Game’s deep. Deeeeeep. Even if it doesn’t seem like it at first.-	The dev, who is a single guy is real passionate  and has been over all these years. The updates are... slow but consistent.-	Best replay system in any game ever.-	Great combination of mindgames and technique. Insert dev’s poker/go analogy.-	One of the friendliest, nicest communities out there.-	Game’s gorgeous.The cons:-	Only one dev, who works really slowly. Don’t expects the updates very often; they ARE regular and consistent, but far inbetween. There’s a reason this game is taking so long. -	The game made it into Steam without some planned feature, as a result of the above. Specifically, there’s no matchmaking, though it is close to done and should make it in soon.	----->	4
41457700	I can already see the potential of this game. While I can say in its current state, $25 is a high price for all the more the game offers, I truly do believe if promoted properly and developed well, it's only a matter of weeks before you see Content Creators left and right talking about this game.	----->	2

41463325	SpyParty is a unique and interesting assymetrical game in both its concept and execution that puts players in a tense psychological duel between a spy and a sniper wherein deception, subterfuge and a very keen eye is the name of the game.As a spy, deceive the sniper by blending in with the rest of the party-goers all while fulfilling the various tasks on your checklist before the time runs out or use your keen eye and deduction as a sniper to single out the spy within the crowd and take them out before they finish their mission. While an early access game with a pretty high asking price for its current amount of content; the fun I've had with it so far along with the depth of its gameplay gets my wholehearted recommendation to try it out at least once. It offers its own flavour of experience both fun and unique that no other game (that I know of) provides.	----->	7
41465363	This game is a completly new and original idea, it is a nice break from the battle royal and fps craze. It brings awareness, deduction and memroy into play and is a breath of fresh air from most other games. There is currently no other game like it. I HIGHLY reccommend playing with a friend over discord as the experience will be a lot more fun and you can start off at the same level because this game has a very high skill cap so if a new player is against somoene with even 10 hours he wont have a chance, give this unique game a chance and play with some friends!	----->	8

I can't wait to get back in there and try and get revenge on my buddy's 6 second kill. Excellent!	----->	4
41474533	Hi there, I've got over 3000 games played on this before it came to Steam!Pros: A game replay system every other competitive game can only dream of (great for learning!)Passionate and communicative developerThe kindest and all around best community in video gamingA unique game experience you're unlikely to get elsewhereThe Mariana Trench of deep gameplay, have to learn the game, AI behavior, and the opponent.  A fantastic game to learn and explore at the same time with a partner or close friendCons:Only 1v1 (so far!), but can fake-play as sniper vs other players, and plenty of practice modes.The impending doom as both roles can sometimes be stressful, and may trigger anxiety.A player who has played more than you who doesn't know how to handicap will win disproportionately (matchmaking with auto handicap will be in Soon!  For now, be talkative, and treat each game as a learning experience.  Playing with someone more knowledgeable is the fastest way to learn!)The new player experience isn't solidified yet, it can be tough to know when to open yourself up to more advanced modes (This is a high priority for the dev, should be soon.  When the sniper starts winning most games, it's a good time to move out of beginner, by looking at the dropdown in top middle of spy setup.  You may also need to turn on advanced modes in order to handicap)UI for lobby will need a touchup, though will become less relevant as Matchmaking queue is implementedKeybindings are stuck in editing a config file for now, and some convenient shortcuts/hotkeys are not listed in UI (yet)Overall, while not for everyone, it is absolutely worth your time and money if it intrigues you.  	----->	22
41475101	This is a promising title with very innovative gameplay that currently suffers from an astoundingly poor UI.  SpyParty is exactly the kind of forward-thinking asymmetrical game design that I crave, yet numerous attempts to enjoy this craftsmanship are thwarted by its own inability to match-make. While the veteran uses are extremely helpful in the lobby chat, it leaves one to wonder why a few simple tools were not made available to Early Access purchasers. Over and over in the lobby, the same beginner questions get repeated, questions which do not exist in games with competent interfaces. For a multiplayer-only game it is an unforgivable sin and therefore can not be recommended at this price until corrected.	----->	5
41475885	Congratulations. You earned one star. Additional stars can be purchased for $4.49 each.	----->	0
41476592	So I never really played video games until I found SpyParty. And what a challenge. At first glance, its EZPZ. You'll jump into a mode where you learn 4 missions and play other people with just about the same number of games and play. You'll play until you kind of figure out what you're playing and then your world expands; A LOT. You get access to 4 other missions and the sniper has to look for more. The more you play, the more you realize you need to be like the AI to succeed. Yes, you need to do missions but it takes SOOO much skill to know how to be an AI and not get shot by the top players of this game. I have >9000 games played and it still doesn't cease to teach me new things about the game each time I die.If the time I spent in game were divided by the $30 I've spent on Spyparty, I'd be spending $0.05/24 hours. I think thats pretty good value. If you come online and ask a question, I do not doubt that you will get at least 3 answers trying to help you solve your issue. Though this game has been in production for a long time, updates are constantly coming out, and there are a lot of plans for what is still to come. You can get it now, or when it comes out officially later, but I am really excited to see all the developments of this game. TL;DR: It takes a lot of work to get good and I really like this game and am excited to see where it goes.Pros: - Exciting skill curve- it takes a lot of experience to get really good at this game- Different than any other game I've ever played. - Re-playability is fantastic- Though you may think that its really simple to figure out to start, I challenge you to play against someone with over 6000 games. - The maps are beautiful and are fun to explore.Cons:- Exciting Skill curve- its not the most accessible game. If you're not up to putting time into the game, you won't find its depth. - The process that takes this game to come out may take a while- Since its a one man dev team with one artist, it's going to take some time for this game to fully come out. Though this is the case, Chris Hecker is absolutely dedicated to this game and is a perfectionist in how he does things.	----->	34

41480700	This is a fairly simple game but has a great concept and I enjoyed playing for awhile. I would love to see this be the foundation for a more complex game, larger rooms, more varied & complex missions, more than 1 spy, more than sniper target, more interesting characters, references to the real wolrd (eg. Donald Trump character LOL). Good job, please build it out alot more!!!	----->	9

41492559	Nejsem příznivec Early Access, ale existují výjimky. Tahle hra je rozhodně jednou z nich. Velmi jednoduchý systém Spy vs Sniper pro dva hráče, který mě překvapil jak návykový dokáže být, sečteno a podtrženo tahle hra mě baví. 22,99 euro se možná zdá moc, ale nelituju jediné koruny... eura. Jediné co bych hře vytknul je, že hráči na steamu nemají ve hře svůj nick ale číslo svého ID/steam, ale to je otázkou času, než tohle updatují, plus doufám že do budoucna přidají i více možností pro špiony, ačkoliv už takhle je to pro snipera těžké udržet si o všem přehled. :D	----->	0

41493819	I think there are enough reviews telling you this is a good game.  Let me tell you why it's worth $25.This game is so simple in its premise, it's almost misleading.  SpyParty is incredibly deep once you jump into [i] experienced [/i] mode.  I've been playing this game since 2013 before it hit Steam, and I have around 268 hours.  That still blows my mind, but every time I play, there's always something new I learn or something I know I can do better.I've seen people argue that the novelty will wear off, and they're right.  But that does not diminish the amount of tension and strategy in the game's design, and it certainly doesn't lessen my experience and enjoyment of the game.  Every single opponent is different, their playstyles and strategies are different, and thus I always have to adapt to my opponent.  So I want to emphasize this is not just a game of Guess Who.  This is a game about watching for subtle cues, getting into your opponent's mind, and outsmarting them.  It can be intimidating for a new player, trust me, I know.  The game has a steep learning curve for experienced mode, [i] and [/i] a high skill ceiling.  But the community is super welcoming and will answer literally any question you have.Is it worth $25?  If you are willing to put your time into it, absolutely yes.  For those who still aren't convinced, I highly encourage people to go to the official SpyParty Twitch channel to watch high-level SpyParty get casted.  It's fascinating and incredibly insightful how someone like me can get engrossed in a game like this for 5 years.	----->	19

41519260	This game is a real blast, what a rush and what a wonderful new concept for a game! Probably the most unique multiplayer game I have played in awhile.One player is the sniper (with only one bullet, so make your shot count!) and the other player is the spy (trying to do objectives and not get the snipers attention. Sounds simple, but the mind games and the gameplay is fantastic and a real rush. The game also has what might be one of the best communities I have come across in my 30+ years of gaming. So far EVERYONE has been nice and helpful to me as a new player, this is very rare in this day and age to see.One game I had two people marked, I was 100% sure it was one of them. But I wasn't sure which one! I also had the option of waiting for time to run out if I didn't think he finished the objectives. So I took a chance and shot one of the two I had marked, it was the other one! At the end it shows that it was one of the guys i had marked BUT he didn't even finish the missions! I could have just waited a few more seconds for the time to run out and I woudl have run! But I had this feeling like I had to take the shot, I knew it was one of them. What touch decisions!Another time I beat a guy who had a bunch of wins within the first 10 seconds of me playing as sniper. What a rush! The other games we had where much closer and he probably took it easy on me a bit but boy, that early detective work as the sniper sure worked good and felt great. A game where you have to outsmart your opponent! Mind vs mind, instead of being more about how fast you can move or aim or shoot, people have to really think and be smart in this one. Games can play out in many different ways, I have only done about 15 games so far but I am already in love with this game. The game is also not finished yet! Can't wait to see what gets added in the future to this wonderful and unique indie game that is fun vs random's and vs friends. I woudl suggest checking out some twitch streams of the game, that go tme interested in the game and the ideas it brings to the table. Nice work devs and keep up the good work!Now let me get back to improving my spy work (I thought I was going to be so much better as spy, but I sure was wrong haha, I have had a few people say how good I am at sniper, even early on. It is also in pretty good shape to, other than a few bugs and a little lag in one game, it has been a wonderful experience and a game I will comeback to very often in the future (especially if some of my good friends pick this up. I can see some epic and funny gaming nights with friends on this game in the future lol). It is really nice to see a game take a unique stab at something new, especially with all these modern games copying something or other, trying to be the next big thing. Spy Party is good ol' fashioned fun! One of the best 1vs1 games I have ever played, it really makes you think differently than you are use to with most games.Dear friends, can you please get this game? I want some more mind wars with my fellow buddies :)	----->	75
41519500	Seriously. Get this game.The developer came up with a brilliant concept for a competitive game and is clearly passionate about polishing it to the point of perfection.It is in an excellent state for an early access, the fact that it has been in beta outside of Steam for like a billion years really shows.Fairly easy to get into, and yet with so much depth to explore.The community so far is great, plenty of players are happy to discuss the match right after it has ended.If you're a fan of asymmetric gaming experiences, or just of human behavior and psychology in general, there's no question this game would suit you.	----->	20

41521946	SpyParty is one of the best games I've ever played. I have currently played over 4,7k games and is still counting, the trailer is just scraping the surface of how deep this game is. The game gets deeper the more you play and you will realize how much more there is to learn.Some of the newer players from Steam leave as soon as they get shot or lose, don't do that. Instead, ask your opponent why you were shot, and you may just have learned something very important! There are currently very well made guides out there that goes deeper into the game, and the tutorial does not cover everything, yet. However a great tutorial that goes through the most important steps :)	----->	7
41522468	Fun game. $25 is a little steep imo.3 hours played and find it way to easy to play sniper or be found out by sniper.Needs a larger range of missions to make it more difficult to get a win as the sniper.That being said, still enjoy playing with mates.Recommend the game but wait til it's on sale or something.	----->	6

41523207	n.b I'm a beta player who's just connected their Steam account, so my playtime is significantly more than shown.This game is a real gem. An instant classic. Not only is it truly unique and captivating but it's executed excellently. I never knew how much fun it could be pretending to be an NPC! There's nice variety in the missions too, with some much harder than others (this in itself lends to some interesting meta gameplay).The 'beginner mode' (which limits the missions and venues available) is actually quite hard for the spy, (I feel it's more about teaching you how to be a sniper) but once you move through to the more complete game it becomes much more balanced and challening; as a sniper once you're looking for any 4 of 7 missions being completed somewhere like the library then it becomes pretty overwhelming! It's one of those rare, well balanced games where you feel at a disadvantage, no matter what side you're on! Very thrilling gameplay considering how bland the activities :)A special mention for the community too, which is friendly and well natured. I've not even seen so much as a grumpy player, let alone a hostile one. Everyone is just having a great time.Love it, highly recommend it, and look forward to playing it for years to come!	----->	12
41523220	I've been playing SpyParty for years. When I first heard about it, I thought it was one of the most brilliant game concepts I ever heard of. I still believe that.At a glance, this game seems like a one-trick pony. But it's really not. This is a game of behavior, deception, and blending in, all while racing against the clock. And on the flip side, you have a game of reading subtle cues, behavior, and using your attention to its best efficiency.If you're someone who enjoys a game with a deep meta-game, SpyParty is the game for you. Once you start managing to divert the sniper's attention with a fake attempt to contact the double agent to try a mission with a more obvious tell, you'll cackle will glee as the sniper's sight visibly becomes erratic trying to highlight and lowlight suspects - meanwhile, you swap a statue. Or you bug the ambassador. You'll feel like you just took a risk and won big. Then you'll feel like you can spend 30 seconds performing an action that will lower your profile. You'll begin to realize the kind of amazing depth this game has.I bought this at $15, but even at $25, this is some of the best value you'll ever get out of a video game if the style appeals to you. It's even more fun with friends!If you enjoy games like Town of Salem, Throne of Lies, Epic Mafia, Secret Hitler, etc, I strongly recommend this game.	----->	36

41527138	A game so good a bought it twice (once for $15 and then $25). For people who are worried about the price tag and the amount of content, you've probably read that the game is deep, but also realize that each map plays in a unique way, and that each character has a suite of custom animations which affect how you play them as spy: want to bug the ambassador smoothly? Use papa danger and his cane; want to contact the double agent, want to swap statue and block the sniper's view? Use Taft's girth to block their view. Want to contact the double agent without being seen talking? Business woman takes several breaks during her talking animation, so just cancel talking without a jarring animation break. This is one of my favorite games of all time. I put about about 40 hours into in the pre-steam beta. I've bounced off of other competitive games but SpyParty keeps me coming back because of the great community, and because it rewards dedication and study in a way many games don't. I am still learning new techniques to avoid detection and manage my perception of everything going on at the party. This game teaches you to read others, and to understand yourself.The game is laser-focused on social interactions; it's a game where you can shoot someone for spending too much time with one guest , for talking out of turn, for being rude to the waiter; a game where you can win by framing another guest, by waiting patiently for the perfect opportunity, by blending in so thoroughly you feel like a self-actualized machine.	----->	14

41529075	Awesome game, either the suspense of being a sniper watching for a spy to shoot at a party of guests in different scenarios attempting to accomplish missions or being the spy attempting to avoid the sniper spotting you mingling in.Excellent guest cast NPC AI makes this job tough, and there is a buzz every match.	----->	0
41529091	In any multiplayer game, what would you say is the overall ratio between positive and negative player interaction? Would you say 80% good? 50%? Maybe there's that one jerk on every team of 5 or 6.Here's the crazy thing about SpyParty: I've been playing this game for maybe a week now (before it was released on Steam), with hundreds of completed rounds, and I have not had a single negative player interaction. 0%. This game's community is so good, and that's constant between helpful veterans and people who have been playing the same amount of time I have. This leads me to believe that there's something about the game's intimacy, this shared 1v1 experience, which garners mutual respect and friendliness in its players. Whether that will stay the same or not is not something anybody can know for sure, but I have high hopes for SpyParty, and you should too. This game is amazing.	----->	-2

Each game only lasts around 3 minutes making it super easy to get a few games in without needed to be invested. Anyone interested in competitive 1v1 should try this game out.	----->	10
41533129	This is hands-down the most thrilling and tense two player game I have ever played. Deep gameplay, an amazing community, and a dedicated developer; this game is amazing on all fronts. Since I bought it a few years back, the game has done nothing but grow- I can't wait to see where it goes. Highly Recommend.	----->	8
41534688	As of this review, I have 329 games and about 35 hours logged on SpyParty's old client and I have no intention of stopping anytime soon. SpyParty is a wonderful, incredibly competitive game about hiding in plain sight, keeping track of party guests, and bannabread. Over those 329 games, SpyParty has made me feel every emotion under the sun and then some. I really cannot sing enough praises about the game.In addition to having crackerjack gameplay, SpyParty also offers a whole bunch of features you would expect from a high-budget eSports game. SpyParty has game replays so you can watch all the games where pesky Spies stole your guest list. The replay system also offers a sort of singleplayer experience because you can play sniper games against the replays of Spy games. Meaning you can take on top players without putting your ego at stake. Features like these are fantastic and Chris Hecker is still working hard at making them even better.That being said, the game is tiny. If you watch a video on YouTube, you will probably see most of what the game has to offer. The game is also relatively hard to get into, not because of a bad community or anything, but because mastering this game is a daunting task that may seem worse when you see people in lobbies with 3000+ wins on Spy and Sniper. SpyParty feels incredibly rewarding however, you are always learning something new every time you play.I love SpyParty and I hope that you will give it a try if it interests you.	----->	12
41537912	Yes, This game is expensive, which is probably it's only downfall. SpyParty is pure genius and is deeply intricate which I'd say is where most people run into their first gripe. There should definitly be an updated better tutorial. I don't buy reviews complaining about not being able to play ever. The lobby is yes; relatively small, but be a bit more patient. There are plenty instances where you can simply play sniper as well, Sniping is the truly the most crucial skill of the game. Weeding out all the opponents instances of interaction with AI, while simultaneously carrying out your strategy to dissect the party is the challenge. It's usually easier to get away with cheap wins being spy, sniper is no joke you degenerate. It's fun using chat at times as well, I like the primitive feel I hope it stays that way honestly. Every menu executes perfectly. Chat is crucial during rounds for each to fully master their mishaps.The advantage of having the Spy being a relatively easy task to cheese, is each player gets their chance to learn through the sniper of the true nature of the party. The accuracy type task performing tests to hit green, red, or gray with clicking left is satisfying to master (Tests are only preformed while Spy). Each color performs a different effect depending on the task at hand. No matter your skill it's likely new players pickup this skill quick which is gold. For example; if you switch a statue hitting green, it will appear to the sniper as if the next AI who picks up that same statue has done the statue swap. If you hit red a thump of metal is heard by the sniper.I understand it's high price, it's well worth that money but I understand getting two friends to buy it can be difficult at times. Just be more patient in the lobbies, plenty of randos to invite and plenty of time to master your sniper skills.	----->	24

41540652	差评只是为了让开发商注意到，我们还是需要中文的。核心玩法有点意思，值得一试， 可是新鲜感过后，还是会腻的，毕竟模式就一个，作为小游戏玩可以，甚至作为行为心理学分析案例也是可以的。只是作为一个游戏，单一玩法可能玩家就不怎么买账了，至少对于国内玩家而言，这价格是一个大型国产RPG的价格啊，有剧情能泡妹纸能抓宠物能收集装备，而这游戏就只能1发。个人建议是后续多了其他模式再买或打折再入也是可以的。当然，如果是主播，想和各位戏精水友增加点节目效果，也是可以推荐一波的。Negative for language， we do need Chinese！Actually， it’s fun and innovative， but not good enough if only in one mode. I look forward to add more different type of challenge.	----->	7
41540935	[i] Note: I played this game for 60+ hours before it came out on Steam. [/i]One spy, the only human at a party populated by NPCs, trying to blend into the crowd while completing missions that risk blowing their cover.One sniper, watching from outside the party, trying to spot and shoot the spy in the hustle and bustle.The game begins.The spy is constantly exposed and vulnerable, trying desperately to fit in with computer-controlled revelers who literally do not know the meaning of fear. The sniper knows a different kind of panic. The party is a mess of hustle and bustle, and spotting one subtle, suspicious act amid a hundred mundane moments requires intense focus.SpyParty can be enjoyed as a casual experience with friends but this is a deceptively deep, subtle challenge. Even at more than 1,200 games played I have a lot to learn.There are still some early access rough edges. The developer has been making slow but steady progress for years, and is very responsive to feedback. The community is one of the best in gaming, eager to answer questions and mentor new players.SpyParty's foibles don’t affect the core gameplay, which is rock solid. It's an excellent, asymmetric 1v1 showdown unlike anything else out there.	----->	2

41545463	I would recommend this game but it definitely needs more content or another angle to warrant the price tag. Considering The Ship was 9.99 on release back in the day, this seems over priced to me. Fun game, fun idea, but not enough replayability for me to get 20 odd euros worth out of it. YET. I do appreciate its early access. Great idea, will buy on release if it has a little more content. Thanks	----->	8

41547049	One of the most unique multiplayer titles. A competitive 1v1 asymetrical multiplayer game where a spy must find out who of the party guests is the spy who himself must complete missions withint a certain timeframe without getting shot by the sniper. While the game might look easy and without much depth at first glance, it actually has quite a lot of depth and is really complex. It's easy to pick up but the skill ceiling is incredibly high. There are so much details and things to know about the game, about how the AI behaves and how animations work etc. you will always learn something new even if you think you know everything.The community is among the best and most friendliest I have seen in any multiplayer game, which might be due to the game being very niche and not a lot of players yet. But you can easily find a player to play with at your skill level at any time.	----->	8
41547154	I purchased Spy Party back in 2012 when it was in early alpha. You probably have no idea how far we've come. We spent years playing in graphics which are worse than a N64. When Chris first announced the reskin, I assumed it'll never happen. It took a long time but we're finally on steam.Spy Party has a great concept and for us early alpha supporters, we've been waiting for the rest of the world to find out. And here we are are.	----->	-1
41547280	really good and really shit, play it youll find out why ahah	----->	3
41547699	I would buy this game in its current state, as a completed game, for $60.I have played this game for five years, and six hundred hours of ACTUAL game time (not counting time running the executable or just hanging out with community members), during the game's pre-Steam beta.  I am, at least at the time of this writing, one of the top players in the game's competitive scene, though I hope you're here to dethrone me (it's very doable).I have been playing video games, devotedly, since 1988. This game is the video game with the most depth that I have ever played, and I have played a LOT of video games, competitive games and otherwise.  After five years, 18000 games, and six hundred hours, I still feel like I have barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer.  After making it to the top of the competitive ladder, I still feel that, nevertheless, I am nowhere near the game's skill cap.It's a truly wonderful game, with detailed, thoughtful design choices, an extremely unique and amazing premise, and as I have said, immense competitive depth.  It rewards the thoughtful, the patient, and the eager-to-learn.  This game has rewired my brain in astonishing ways that get you thinking differently, a bit like when you played Portal for the first time, but more so.The game itself is excellent, with breathtaking, beautiful art, and I have never been more pleased to strongly recommend something on Steam.  It's as polished and well-designed as a non-early-access game and I'd buy it as a completed game as-is for $60, as I said.  And yet we're still getting MORE features, which is why we're in early access.---And no review of this game would be complete without mentioning the community.  This is the best community I have ever seen in video games.  It's as close to free of toxicity as any game community can be.  The dev is directly involved with the community and talks to/hangs out with/fixes support problems inpromptu with random users daily.  The community of this game has been like a second family to me for the five years I have been playing it, and I have made so many great friends through it.  $25 is a steal.  I would have bought this game at the full $60.	----->	46

41559228	Don't let my playtime fool you, I've been playing this game for 4 years, and have about 7500 games under my belt.You know this game's concept is amazing, that's why you're reading these reviews. The developer has taken this idea of a Reverse Turing Test and polished it to a mirror shine. Pros:     Incredible Depth. If you put in the time to climb the learning curve, you will be greatly rewarded.      Intense Tension and Mind Games. This is not a game for the faint of heart. Every time the laser flicks past you and you're not sure if you were marked more or less suspicious, every time you bug the ambassador, unsure if you will be caught, every time you hear banana bread as sniper, this game is filled with intense moments on both sides of the rifle that will keep you on the edge of your seat.     The best community in video games. I'm not being hyperbolic. The SpyParty community is astoundingly kind, helpful, and polite. This is the Canada of videogames. I've made so many friends through this game, the community is like a second family to me. Cons:     Slow Development Cycle: This game has a single developer who has been working on it for 8 years. Updates are great when you get them, but they are very infrequent.      Steep Learning Curve: If you don't take the time to learn this game and progress past beginner mode, you aren't going to see what it really has to offer.	----->	11
41560783	Awesome, quick and super fun PvP strategy game!In my opinion it hits the sweet-spot between depending on lucky cards and creating strategies to take down your opponent on the spot, which makes it so that after playing the game for a while and learning it, you'll know how to counter your opponent's moves, even if the hand you got isn't the most suitable. After the beginning, there aren't slow moments in each battle, since as time passes (usually 1v1 games take from 1:15 to 10 mins), your cooldowns get reduced, so that you can create complete mayhem in the battlefield. And once you understand the game well, it's super satisfying to take down an enemy's horde with a single Grenadier, or open way for your Cleaver to deal tons of damage with each swing, or even hold on to your 100hp and manage to comeback in 15 seconds with an awesome combo. There are tons of strategies and deck possibilities, so you can try something new everytime.  Totally recommend giving it a try.	----->	16

41562361	Learning the art of deception and detection has never been so fun and satisfying. Very high skill ceiling and lots of nuance to keep you playing and learning. So far i've played about 15 hours and all my opponants have been helpful. I highly reccomend you watch some of the streams to see if its the game for you. Cheers :)	----->	1
41562525	I've owned this game for about a year and a half, and with 3000 games under my belt can definitely say it's one of the most enthralling, tense, and deep gaming experiences I've ever had. The premise alone is interesting enough to keep you going for a few evenings, but then you realize that this game has more to offer than you could have thought possible. I can't express how incredible it feels to improve at this game, learn something new and put it into practice, and begin digging into what Chris Hecker has created. It's enjoyable to LOSE, just so you can figure out why the hell you were shot. You never stop learning, whether you're an hour in having just finished the tutorial, or playing competitively 20k games in. KrazyCaley wrote a 70 page long book on how to improve your spy play (and that's only half of the game), in case that gives you some idea about the skill cap. There's even a community-run competitive league right now, and while hopefully there's eventually built in ranked play, it works wonderfully in the interim to help scratch that e-sports itch if you have one.The community is amazing and helpful, the dev is passionate about the product, and it's just so. goddamn. fun. Buy this.	----->	11

The SpyParty Discord channel is a great place to learn.	----->	12

41577122	I can't say enough great things about this game. It's a psychological battle with (for the most part) very good balance. Victories are satisfying, failures are almost always deserved, and the rush of out-thinking your opponent is like nothing else. I'm so glad there's a game that tests your mental abilities and not just your twitch reflexes for once.Bravo!	----->	10
41577569	I F&*king LOVE and HATE this beautiful game.

41592993	Great fun! The gameplay seems simple at first but the strategies you use to win are diverse.The variety of the results is great: no two rounds end the same. Sometimes you will be playing as the spy and give yourself up right away. Other times it will be a nail biter and you will have to juggle wondering if the spy is almost done with their missions and how much time you have left to gather more evidence.The maps all have different feels to playing them. Playing a game on cramped map is different that the ones that consist of many corners in which to hide.This game is great for short or long game sessions as well. You can end up playing a few rounds in 20 minutes, depending on how long they go.The community seems strong as well. So far, I have always been able to find an approximately equally experienced opponent within a few minutes.	----->	8

41597383	NPCの中に紛れるPCを探し出す系のゲームですWiiUとかPS3とかでも似たようなのがありましたが、それ一本のゲームっていうのは結構珍しくて好きですこのゲームはスパイとスナイパーの1vs1のゲームでありスパイ側は溶け込みながらもミッションを実行スナイパー側はそのスパイを指摘するという作りになっていますスパイ側のプレイヤーはスナイパーのレーザーを浴びながらも、淡々とNPCとしてクールにふるまい時にはフェイントなどを用いてスパイを誤認させつつも、勝利を目指します一方でスナイパー側は、数多く存在するNPCの一挙一動を注目しスパイを指摘します一発指摘の上に、スパイがミッションを終わらせるまでに当てなければいけないのでどっちかというとスナイパー側の方が精神を消耗する心理戦をしてる感じです[strike] どこぞの4人から懐中電灯を食らう殺人鬼と一緒ですね[/strike]総括すると、スパイ側はNPCのフリをするロールプレイが楽しくスナイパー側はそのスパイの思考を推理するのが楽しいゲームです。一方でまだいくつかシステムに問題があります1つ目は、結局のところNPCとPCの動作の違いでスパイが分かってしまうことですこのゲームは俯瞰で上から見上げるため、NPCとPCの違いがとてもはっきり出てきます誰かと会話するためのポジションに移動したつもりがその手前で止まってしまい浮いてしまうなんてこともしばしばですスパイとしては決まった地点で決まったことをするだけでいいので自由ではなくコマンド式の移動をできるシステムにする方が良いのではないでしょうか2つ目はゲームのモードですこのゲームはチュートリアルやデフォルトがビギナーvsビギナーというモードで作られているのですがこのモードは公式が認めるほど、スナイパー有利ですその理由としては、ビギナーvsビギナーにおいてスパイの行動がある程度制限されており（ミッションが4つの内4つ達成　歩きながらのミッションの実行ができないなど）スパイの行動が丸わかりだからです。確かに、慣れているプレイヤーならこのモードで遊ばなければいいと分かるかもしれませんが初心者のプレイヤーはどうしてもこのモードを選んでしまいます「ちょっと待って、そのモードは本当に初心者向けなんだある程度遊んだたらすぐにEXモードにした方がいいよ」と英語で伝えられる人ならいいかもしれませんが出来ない人はどうしてももどかしい気分になってしまいます	----->	0

41617545	Even though I don't have many hours on this game. I've been a long time supporter of the BETA version of SpyParty. The main goal of SpyParty is to blend in as an A.I. Geust. It's very strange to see one crowd of people and all but one is a real person. I found this game to be great with friends, and servers have far more players then in the Beta. If you haven't picked up SpyParty yet, I highly recomend it to you. Also several communities host tournament games if you're into that.

41620382	SUBTLE AND EXCITING AS THE SPY GENRE SHOULD BESpy Party is a game built on a seemingly simple formula: one player is a spy hiding among AI civilians at a party, while the other player is a nearby sniper trying to spot him (and take him out).  The spy must complete a few missions at this party to win before a timer runs out, and must try to strike a balance between working toward his missions, and acting natural to throw off his would-be assassin.  The sniper can win by shooting the spy, of course, but also by keeping such close tabs on the party that there is no safe way for the spy to complete his missions before time runs out.  At the end of each round, the players switch sides between sniper and spy roles.  Matches continue for as many rounds as the players wish, and score is kept each round.Controls in the game are very simple and can be learned in a few minutes by following the tutorial.  Advanced play benefits from a few optional mechanics that significantly enrich the game and improve balance.  These optional mechanics aren't explained well in the tutorial, but when you're ready to try them in your matches, you'll find the community is suprisingly friendly and willing to help you learn.  Withing just a few games, you'll feel comfortable playing with all the advanced rules, and you'll have fun while learning.  To improve quickly, you can also watch replays of your matches, and spectate other players as they play.Spy Party was in early beta for several years before hitting Steam.  It shows.  As of Steam release, matchmaking and replays have a few minor bugs, but gameplay is highly polished.  The game isn't demanding on hardware, and it is very forgiving of high latency connections.Ultimately, Spy Party is a very different kind of PvP strategy game- unique but familiar, with nuance and complexity rarely found in strategy titles.  Highly recommended.	----->	26

41637429	Fun to play with friends. I am not the biggest fan of playing vs randoms as there is no matchmaking yet and I feel that there often is a pretty big gap between the players skill, even when trying to invite someone with similar games. Player base is fine right now, usually doesn't take more than 2-3 minutes to find someone. Gameplay wise it's pretty unique and potentially has unlimited shelvelife if you are into the competitive aspect. I like the replay system where one can instantly check out moments from the just played game and hop straight back into continuing the game. Right now there is still an ugly lobby that while functional doesn't really fit well within the rest of the game. Highly recommend playing someone your level/a friend. Questionable recommendation for people playing solo, only if you aren't the type of person to easily get frustrated.	----->	11

41639576	Already in its current Early Access Beta-state this game is gameplay-wise more complete than many AAA 1.0 releases out there right now. If the creator keeps up his work and fulfills his own high expactations for this game, we are really in for a treat in the segment of asymmetric multiplayer games.The choice of the art style, theme and atmosphere is superb and I am looking Forward to see more of it. In general it is the perfect game to play 2-5 rounds now and then as pastime. Still right now I can't really see me spending the time on several thousand rounds on this game like many of the veteran players already did but if the content updates on maps, characters and playmodes keep coming up as promised by the creator there will be a lot more to do in the future.Very promising and already now defenitely worth playing.For all early access burned people: I know your pain, believe me. But even if this game stays in EA forever, you will have a blast. This game is very clearly the creator's baby and he won't let it die in the corner rather than feeding and caring for it until it is ready for adulthood.I want to address some of the negative reviews: Almost all of them mention the high price. Well, the price IS actually debatable. Still I think it is worth it. It isn't a steal for sure but if you like the gameplay you will get your money's worth.	----->	14
41641692	o my! this is so fun!! hahaha, need a lot of practice though. A LOT! you think it's easy?? pretending to be an NPC is not as easy as it sound. really, you have to try this game, when I watched the trailer I thought 'well, it's easy.. you just have to walk around and stuff' but it's not! this is a fun game!	----->	4
41649633	Incredibly unique game with a lot of depth! I'm loving my experience with Spy Party so far. The community is small but incredibly nice and helpful! The game is a competitive 1v1 social deduction experience like no other. I'm new but can already tell from watching high level play that there is so much depth to the different mechanics, so much to learn, and the gameplay seems like it will stay as satisfying as it is now once I've put 100 hours in. It may not be for everyone but it is DEFINITELY for me. If you are interested at all I encourage you to check it out, maybe watch some twitch/youtube or read over the Wiki to get a feel for it if you're hesitant on the $25 purchase. But know you're supporting a great dev, great game, and great community if you do decide to buy	----->	22

41652662	As someone who enjoys the multiplayer of Assassin’s Creed, SpyParty’s central conceit has appealed to me immediately. This week, I finally got to try the tutorial and one online game and it did not disappoint. With all the moving parts in SpyParty, I was worried about how long it’d take me to learn the its nuances – I knew I wouldn’t be good immediately, but I at least wanted to understand what others were doing to make them good. The tutorial did a great job of this. Chris Hecker himself narrates it and walks you through the facilities and strategies of both the Sniper and Spy.As the Spy, you are trying to complete objectives in a time limit without getting caught. Each of the objectives will expose you to some degree – swapping a statue is particularly risky because the Sniper can memorize the statue placement in advance. As a Sniper, you’re looking for these tells with the ability to “lowlight” or “highlight” guests based on your observations. When you’re sure, you can pull the trigger.Getting through the tutorial gave me the false sense of confidence I needed to dive right in to online multiplayer. I lost in short order but knew exactly why and this is SpyParty’s biggest boon. It’s immediately readable and relays complex information in understandable fashion, allowing the player to trust the game and eventually, their instincts. I can’t wait to dig in and lose some more.[quote]Courtesy of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32143389/]Notable Releases[/url] curator group[url=http://notablereleases.com/post/indie-weekly-2018w15/#spyparty]Full Review[/url][/quote]	----->	6

41668940	Picked this up after seeing in on youtube and for such a simple idea it is such a fun game. Both the spy and sniper are equally fun to play as and it's cool that every game is diferent in its own way. From what I've seen so far the community is super friendly and I've met some great people. Only downside, can't find a way to change my username because I'm logging in through steam, just a random jumble of like 50 letters? Small thing but it annoys me LOL.

After 9-10 hours in the game (in 2 days) i can say this thing is superaddictive i cant stop playing.. fast ranked maches with different masters and strategies and a huge amount of different minion cards! Thats the sht bro , if you like this kind of games just get it.. The only bad thing about the game is that 1/5 maches are canceled before they even start so you wait sometimes a bit.. but i think this can be fixed , the rest game is great	----->	6

41676733	Played this game and Golf With Your Friends and let me say this.Golf With Your Friends is as classic as you can get when it comes to mini-golfing, not much extra, not much less.However with more support added to Golf It, it's definitely worth the extra couple $. The original maps are alright, but what makes this game is the community. People who make maps and also the Developers who add things for map makers is what really makes this game way better and out shine the others.Controls are more realistic however compared to Golf With Your Friends, as you're using your mouse and gauging your own power based on how fast or slow you move your mouse, while in GWYF there's just a simple power meter that to me feels like cheating.Very fun to play with your friends, Easily could put another couple hundred hours as long as the community thrives and the Developers keep things relatively fresh.EDIT: Just a quick update as it's been 2 years. GWYF have finally added the ability to edit and add custom maps to the workshop, but the review still stands in terms of gameplay.	----->	14

41689353	Been around this one from the very beginning. It's an exceptionally good 1v1 game with fairly simple mechanics. You're either a) trying to act like one of the NPCs while completing your missions or b) trying to watch for tells so that you shoot the correct target.If you're struggling, the tutorial really is excellent in this early stage. If you're still struggling after that, pipe up in chat as the community is very helpful.11/10 Would accidentally shoot a disabled man again whilst aiming for the dwarf.	----->	2

41718670	It is at this point that the long-term, social paradigms indicate the progression. Often a compiling impalpability homogenises temporary manipulations. The open and dis-embodied paradigm of that borderline shows the manner in which the inversion of it is calculated. An exaggerating inconsistency urges graphic episodes. The concave and aleatoric consideration unveils and dissolves the bilateral, mobile expression.	----->	-2
41723484	Impalpable connections determinate the absence of observers. By the means of symptomatically structuralised starting points, a view has been expanded osmotically. It creates reciprocity, interactive geometries from disjunctive and small-sized found footages. The fictional, grammatical raster formulates and polarises the ornamental function. The result is a cross-disciplinary substitution of sub-textual confrontations that collaborates beyond the absorptive aesthetic of niches.	----->	0

41726597	完整测评地址:https://steamcn.com/t382124-1-1游戏的测评及总结：游戏的整体性：        这款游戏注重的是双方的技术和心理上“博弈”，是选择“敌不动，我不动”这样以静制动的方式，什么也不做的等待敌方玩家先沉不住气露出马脚后将其击败；还是“此心妄动，随性而动”，各种出言挑衅对方，给对方心理和生理上双重施压，使对方按奈不住暴露出破绽；又或是“借刀杀人”使用各种假动作来迷惑对手，陷害NPC，然后取得游戏的胜利。这些多变且多样的玩法都是可以由玩家自己来决定和选择，而且根据游戏的练习模式中，查看角色动作中可以发现，未来游戏还会拥有更多的玩法，比如更多迷惑狙击手和嫁祸NPC的方式来丰富游戏体验。但目前游戏的玩法变化和套路还是略显单一，各种NPC的行为模式也有迹可循（有些行为NPC和玩家的区别还是比较明显的），在线游戏的人数并不是特别多（可能我多数都是在晚上玩的）。不过目前游戏的游玩环境特别的好，我在游戏中遇到了很多十分友善的外国友人，他们会为新手玩家主动提供帮助，解答新人玩家对这个游戏提出的问题，我甚至还在游戏中交到了一个法国友人。（这环境真的棒，我已经很久没有在游戏中感受到这种的温暖了）。此游戏的问题还有目前游戏开发的进度问题，因为这是个独立游戏，而且制作组也只是个不到10个人小团队，这就造成的开发进程十分的缓慢，不过也可以看出游戏的制作者对这款游戏有多用心（相信可以从他们做了9年都没做完的这种精益求精的精神中感受的出来）。此外，这款游戏还是一个需要玩家花费足够多的游戏时间反复熟悉AI的行为和动作以便更好的融入或者识别出真正的AI，因为某些游戏的操作缘故会让你在一群AI中显得十分的突兀，比如一直站着不动，或者是长时间的待在某个地方，玩家需要尽量的保持移动自己，还有我觉得游戏中AI的行为和动作应该不仅是局限于重复的在执行玩家的任务范围里来回的走动，应该在游戏的过程中做些随机的动作或者其他行为，以及给每个人物一些鲜明的特性，比如某个角色可以更快的色诱某些角色.....等等之类的，让玩家更好加深对于角色的印象以便代入其中。游戏的画面及音乐:       这款游戏的画面总的来说并不是特别好，相比其他独立游戏可以说是差强人意，甚至是粗糙。人物建模，还可圈可点，很好的描绘各种肤色各种穿着光鲜亮丽的上流社会的精英人士共聚一堂的景象，不过人物之间的特色并不是特别的明显，除了只有一个特别矮小的人物，可以更好依靠矮小的身材把周边的人和建筑作为掩体遮挡狙击手的视线，其他人物感觉就是只是换了面貌和衣服并无任何的特色，还有就是游戏中人物碰撞时偶尔会有发生穿模的现象。游戏的音乐和音效，游戏中基本没有什么音乐，音效倒是很好的刻画了一个聚会中各种人物谈论的吵杂的环境，“导致我一开始还以为是进入了一个菜市场”，游戏其他一些音效也十分简陋。比如狙击手射出子弹的“biu“的枪声。游戏的剧情和成就：      目前游戏中还未有任何的剧情和成就（之后会不会加入就不晓得了）游戏评分：                   加分项       +独特的风格       +技术与心理双重考验       +简单的操作                   减分项        -游戏模式单一        -游戏画面和音效略为简陋        -没中文        -售价略贵               评分：6/10（有趣的游戏，值得一试）游戏的总结：      这款游戏容量只有区区的300多M，但蕴含着的却是超高的游戏性和特别的风格，不同于“三国杀”和“狼人杀”这类同样是心理游戏而且可以容纳更多人一起游玩，这款游戏的一局比赛从头到尾都只有2个玩家，游戏中影响玩家判断的元素却不仅仅只有玩家本身，比如作为间谍，你会时刻处在一种被监视的环境下（或者玩家认为自己现在正处在被监视的环境中），这款玩家更多是在跟自己的心理和自己的决策做斗争，比起其他心理游戏这款游戏也更能直观的看到玩家的行为，我撰写本次测评时短短15小时的游戏时间仅仅也只是接触到了这款游戏的皮毛，这款游戏还是具有他独特的魅力和无限的可能。（就是售价贵了点）	----->	0

41736427	Update: This games community is pretty dead, a sale and or a price reduction would do it some good. The quality of content here is really good. But it's tough to justify the price when there's no one to play with unless you have a dedicated partner. Good luck and god speed finding someone to play with on their discord, the LFG section is basically dead. Thus I changed my recommendation to No.Previous Review:Spy Party is one of those games that's easy to get into but hard to master. The idea is simple, two players face off in an enviroment. The Spy trying to blend into the AI and complete his tasks (which is often quite tense and challenging) and The Sniper, tying to spot out the spy. With multiple objectives, varying difficulties and learning new methods/strategies, this game has a lot going for it. This is my favourite game to play for short burts as a game tends to last ~5min if not less. The community is also very kind, I often have pleasant interactions through the text chat ingame, talking about how we discoverd each other and discussing different strategies. People have complained about the price and I can understand their complaints if they choose to not invest too much time into learning the game and stick to only the beginner difficulty. This game really starts to open up at Intermediate and greater. Spy Party offers a ton of replayability and enjoyment that I'm sure to continue to get my money's worth.	----->	5
41736428	Rarely comes out a game with such a unique concept. There is a lot that can be said about this game, but i will focus on two things:1) The amount of details in the game is impressive. From the missions themselves to the character animations (which are different for each of them), every single detail adds to the gameplay and to the atmosphere, creating an immersive experience. The gameplay is really deep, to the point that while i have played more or less 400 games at the time of writing this review, i feel im still scratching the surface of the game.2) The community is one the best I've seen in a competitive multiplayer game. I have yet to encounter a toxic person and everyone is willing to help and point mistakes if you ask them.The only negatives right now is the lobby UI which is a little rough and the lack of tutorial for the experienced missions, both of which are about to change as the game leaves early access.The price may seem steep for an indie game in early access. I had doubts myself before i bought it, but if you feel this kind of game interests you, it's worth every single penny.	----->	5

41744172	The UI for multiplayer looks like a game a made in 2005 - Game worth: £5-10 not 20.Thumbs up for gameplay though.	----->	2
41744249	I've been playing this game on and off for about 5 years. I enjoy it because it's a game that requires a lot of strategy and knowledge without having the insane difficulty curve of something like a fighting game or moba. The community is very friendly. Most veteran players are happy to play some games with you and answer questions. I've never had a bad experience while playing this game. The designer, Chris Hecker, does a stream every time he releases a patch and posts a lot of updates on Twitter and Facebook.	----->	2
41746936	I had bought this game YEARS ago and only played it a handful of times. The lobbies were typically sparsely populated and – while a cool concept – there wasn't a ton to keep your interest. Browsing for something to buy the other night, I saw that it was on Steam. Wondering if it was really the same game, I went to the old site, logged in, and saw that I was able to transfer my license over to my Steam account. I did and played a few matched and remembered how much fun and how unique an experience this game is. It's nerve wracking having a laser sight hovering around you as you're trying to inconspiciously pull off tasks. There's more to do this time around and the graphics are a significant upgrade, so we'll see how long it holds my interest. So far though, it's been a blast revisiting this critically lauded yet underappreciated gem.UPDATE: so it didn't really hold my attention beyond the two hours I replayed it. With that said, I'd still have recommended it until I saw the price! 25$ is outrageous (and significantly more than I paid all those years ago). I stand by the fact that it's a unique experience, but the gameplay is still a unitary gimmick - an interesting one, mind you, but a gimmick nonetheless. What a shame. If it was 5$ the community of players might have grown; however, I anticipate the lobbies will be a ghost town in a few months.	----->	9
41749913	The people saying that this game is too expensive for the amount of content are sadly mistaken. This game has more depth and interesting decisions to make than most similarly or higher-priced games do on full release. There's a lot of mechanics to learn and as you get better you see the mechanics combining and clashing in interesting ways to form a really strong basis for a ton of mind games. Sleuthing your way through all your missions as the spy with seconds left or making the perfect read on an unsuspecting spy as the sniper is so satisfying. Not to mention the visual design of SpyParty is so god damn good. All the characters look great, they span a huge variety of dress-wear, genders, cultures, body shape, age and able-ness. The settings fit thematically and are all good to look at and function well both to communicate information to the sniper and for the spy to play tricks. Please give this game a try and support unique and interesting indie games.	----->	15

41754271	I had the game then it said there needed to be an update, i tried updating it however there was no option and nowhere was saying it needed an update apart from the game so after a couple of days trying to install the update and playing the game i decided to uninstall it and then reinstall it but once i uninstalled it the game vanished and it says i never bout it and have to pay again.......................................HELP PLEASE !?!?!?!?!?!	----->	-2
41757824	This is definitely a labor of love. I have a lower hour count, but I've been playing since Alpha YEARS AGO. A surprisingly competitive game, you're either a spy trying to execute missions in secret or a sniper trying to locate the spy before they're successful. What I love about this it's accessibility for new players while still having enough depth to keep veterans around. I see some people in lobbies with 1000+ wins with both Sniper and Spy so that should attest to its staying power.I highly recommend if you like: Competitive and/or hide'n'seek games.	----->	11
41761697	I absolutely love the concept, the art style, and mechanics of this game. It is honestly very unique and interesting and has some very cool mechanics behind it.However, I cannot recommend it at a $25.00 price. There simply isn't enough content in my opinion to warrant such an asking price. The most I would pay for this game in it's current state is $10. For the time being I have refunded my copy of the game, but I will likely buy it again if it ever goes on sale.	----->	7
41802191	I have played a total of around 1000 games of Spy Party (admittedly, this is not very many in comparison to some of the best players). I purchased the game before it released on steam. SpyParty is very much worth the 25 dollars, I assure you. The game might not seem like much, and on the surface there isn't that much to the game. The reason the game is worth the $25 is due to the insane amount of depth in this game. Once you've gotten past the surface, you begin to see how complex and competitive this game really is. This game is perhaps one of the most competitive 1v1 games since Starcraft or Quake 3. You can get a near limitless amount of gametime out of this game due to how much depth and complexity there is here. After ~500 games there are still tons of techniques I am still learning to try and compete with higher level players. There has not been any other game with such an extreme level of competitive complexity that has come out recently as this.	----->	13

41822372	I highly recommend this game, even in it's current form.  This is a limited beta for sure, but the concept is so fun, and the gameplay is open ended and different every time.  I played for two hours in my first session, and wan't bored even once.  Certain aspects are definitely going to need tweaking before the final version (for example, the statue swap task in its current form makes it way too easy for the sniper to spot the spy), but theres so much promise crammed into what's available now that I'm far too excited to see where this game goes and how it develops to get hung up on little things like that.  I'm a big fan and I'm going to be telling a lot of people about this game for sure.	----->	10
41823229	需要扮演狙击手找SPY或者作为SPY完成任务，总体游戏狙击手可玩度不高，主要是观察，而作为SPY需要时刻伪装提心吊胆，但是对于游戏的胜利规则有点迷茫，狙击手只有一次机会，在规定时间前找到SPY，而SPY则需要做各种各样的任务，所以对狙击手而言似乎有那么点不公平	----->	0

41826757	I love the game but my only issue is not being able find players in matchmaking, (although when I partied up with a friend it seemed to drop other players in albet very slowy) now if they actually fix matchmaking, then I would highly recommend this to anyone that likes to solo que and enjoys a few holes of Golf.

41850354	I'm sure there's a good game in here - it's just not here yet. I get the whole 'early access' thing, but I find it nearly unplayable in its current state. The controls are difficult - putting and looking around only with the mouse. Your only view is centered on the ball - it makes it really difficult to get the layout of the entire hole. The game is obviously fully rendered, you just aren't able to look around well enough. I'll hang on and hope that they see this through to make a good game. I wish that they had spent more time perfecting the game before trying to perfect the online multiplayer thing.	----->	10

41855123	It’s not very often you find a game that turns a simple tap of the A button into a harrowing, sphincter-clenching ordeal. SpyParty does exactly that. Developer Chris Hecker describes it as a “tense, competitive spy game”. He’s not wrong.This is a totally unique concept executed with precision and passion. It has the charm and iconic presence of beloved board games like Cluedo but adds a level of excitement and intensity that you just can't get from any other media format. Watching a friend clumsily bug the ambassador in plain sight never gets old. And seeing the sniper's red dot sight settle on the back of your head never gets any less terrifying. There's a lot to say about SpyParty, so you can find the [url=https://oldgrizzledgamers.com/first-glimpse/spy-party-review-pc/]full review here.[/url]Note: The vast majority of my matches have been played using the standalone version of the game available from the website, hence the limited time logged by Steam.	----->	12
41860612	a fun game where u build a deck of cards and then this triggers the card creature to appear on screen in the arena where u fight your monsters from your cards against an opponent and their monsters from their cards. its addicting. fun. and there's always someone better just when you think you got it.  Its like chess in that u have to use strategy and defend as well as go offensive.  Lower cards are more quick but do less damage. Higher cards take a couple more seconds to use but they are usually worth the wait... unless your opponent is attacking you with numerous minions at once.  Different heros u choose have different special attacks that are incorporated in the match along with your cards.  Fun strategy game.... I recommend this game for a fun casual gaming experience. Matches last anywhere from 1 minute to 10 tops. usually matches are 5 minutes long.  after getting the game i have not spent a penny and i have a deck that can compete with most anyone.  it takes a lil while to get the hang of it but all u do is click on the right cards at the right time and your creatures will do the rest.  There are different choices for main character with different special abilities and skins too...all of which you can get for free just by playing ...and game is fun so playing is actually more fun than a grind.  I hope this game stays poplular so the ques to get into game remains at only a few seconds to find a match usually. u can solo or team with randoms which is actually super fun with the 2v2. but 1v1 is great too.  VERY FUN AFFORDABLE Addicting game. NOW for the Bad NEWS:OK now its been months and nothing new except a couple cards. I want new characters with new card abilities and maybe rework some of the cards nobody uses.  its fun for a while but game is standing still right now which saddens me because this game is a blast to play....just not same stuff over and over. also if the characters had a bigger difference and or a skill that was actually useful that would be fun too. but really so many cards could be so much better.  now its hard to get enough cards for a deck that I like. when i first started it was fun but now i see 75% of cards are prettty unuseable.  I hope they update the cards soon... and make the characters have better abilities.... and add new characters we can use with different abilities.  like an archer character that makes all crossbow skills cost one mana less even. just something to make the characters more different and fun. so as of now this game was fun for a bit but due to nothing exciting happening i hardly play. i dont know. i do know its worth a couple dollars though.	----->	67

41898658	I put many hours into the game during the beta, back when everyone looked like Toby.Fun game, no other one like it exists. I've had a lot of fun with it, even matching with random opponents. As it's a very small indie dev, development is extremely slow, but the dev is always working and listening to feedback. That said, I have a very hard time recommending it for $25, especially when similar or cheaper priced games exist like Factorio, Stardew Valley, Into the Breach, Oxygen Not Included, etc, all of which are far more developed and full of content and most of which are cheaper. There just isn't enough content here to justify a $25 price tag, even if the game were in a finished state (which it isn't). I'd say grab it for around $15 if you are on the fence.	----->	8

41929110	Fun concept, and this is not to denigrate the developer's work on this game, but there simply is not enough content to justify a $25 price tag were it fully released, much less in early access. Pick it up during a steam sale.	----->	0
41937998	[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review [/h1][quote] PLEASE NOTE: I originally purchased SpyParty before it joined the Steam Early Access, so please, do not take Steam's playtime at face value! Enjoy :) [/quote][b] Banana Bread... [/b]SpyParty is a game developed Chris Hecker and John Cimino and published by Chris HeckerThis game is [i] finally [/i] on Steam Early Access after years and years being developed effortlessly by Chris HeckerThe game's premise is simple, you either play the Spy or the Sniper. With the Sniper you have to pinpoint down the Spy and with the Spy you have to blend in with the rest of the party's membersIt is really fun to play, simple to learn and hard to master. SpyParty can be enjoyed as a casual experience with friends but this is a deceptively deep and subtle challengeThere are still some Early Access rough edges. The developer has been making slow but steady progress for years, and is very responsive to feedback. The community is one of the best in gaming, eager to answer questions and mentor new playersSpyParty's foibles don’t affect the core gameplay, which is rock solid. It's an excellent, asymmetric 1v1 showdown unlike anything else out there![h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1][b] REVIEW SOURCES: [/b][list][*] https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025372245/recommended/329070/	----->	12

41985572	Innovative concept, nail-biting duels and a welcoming community.I've had hours of fun with this over the last couple of weeks, highly recommended if you're into observation, deduction and sneaking around pretending to be a NPC. A single game is over in a few minutes, so you can jump in for a couple of rounds or stay for a longer match if you find an good opponent.SpyParty is a game that makes you feel clever, when you win a game it's usually because you outsmarted the other player. The premise is quite straight-forward, but there is an impressive depth to the game. With every session I learn something new, and it is very rewarding to know that you get better with every game.There are a few rough edges and missing features still, but the game itself is very much playable. Matchmaking (which from what I understand is right around the corner) will make it easier to get into games, but inviting from the lobby works for now. The community is small and very friendly, I usually have a nice chat with most people I play against. Best of all, almost everyone is willing to give you tips and pointers on what mistakes you've made, so that you'll improve even quicker.	----->	19

41988826	Como um espião, qualquer movimento pode significar a sua morte; como um sniper, você só tem uma chance para atirar no espião. Bem-vindo a SpyParty. Parece um jogo simples, mas jogando você descobrirá várias camadas de complexidade que deixam a jogatina tensa, porém super divertida.Jogando de espião, você está no meio de outros personagens controlados pela IA, e precisa agir que nem eles, enquanto completa várias missões. Trocar uma estátua, ou contatar o agente secreto, em um limite de tempo, e sem deixar o sniper descobrir seu disfarce. A cada segundo que passa a partida fica mais tensa - você pode olhar o relógio para adicionar mais tempo, mas e se o sniper perceber? Você pode fingir que está contatando o agente secreto para enganar o sniper e tirar a suspeita dos seus ombros, mas e se não funcionar? São riscos que você tem que correr para ganhar, mas que deixam o jogo divertido, sem ser muito frustrante. Cada partida é uma aprendizagem, e na próxima você já irá notar que estará melhor no jogo.Jogando de sniper, você vê 10 ou 20 pessoas diferentes na sua frente, e pode achar que será muito difícil achar o espião, mas prestando atenção e marcando quem é ou não é suspeito, dentro do limite de tempo, você consegue achá-lo. Se você ouvir 'banana bread', o espião está chamando um agente secreto, então você pode marcar todos que estão perto de um agente secreto como suspeitos... ou será que ele está só fingindo? Você só tem uma chance, uma bala para acertar o espião, então um erro significa game over.O jogo ainda não tem matchmaking, e não está em português, mas vale a pena jogar, mesmo pelo preço de 47 temers. É um jogo diferente dos demais, que é complexo porém divertido e recompensador, que te entreterá por várias horas.	----->	2

42012953	Interesting concept.  However, $25 for this game is way too much. Especially, when majority of the game is in a box and pretty simple.  It's definitely a fun play though not worth 25 dollars. I would throw that money into a game that has more to the story than just a simple platform. Good luck to the rest of ya'll. I'm giving it a thumbs down because of the price point on this game with very little content.	----->	10
42014637	Don't waste your money on this, unless you're wanting to join a very small community on Discord to actually get a game.  Or have a friend to play this with.Much has been talked about re the price of this game in the discussions, and the high price is to pretty much keep Steam scrubs away, who might ruin this 'amazingly friendly' SpyParty community.  The game certainly hooked me from the start, at the Steam release, there were lots of people to play with in the lobby.  The lobby player numbers dwindled very quickly and now the only real way to get a game is to join the SpyParty discord community.  That is fine for lots of people in the SpyParty community, but doesn't suit me at all. Every discussion regarding the price and player base is vehemently defended by a few very vocal SpyParty fans.... I didn't want to re write a negative review of this game, but I am now seeing many people who are disappointed in the number of players and the price.  To the new players thinking hmmm is this worth it... my answer is NO, unless you've got some friends to buy this also! I had a negative review up a while ago, that I deleted because someone in the community accused me of being hypociritical. ie:  Giving a negative review (even though I enjoyed the game), would keep players away, therefore adding to the player base problem.  So I deleted the review and have waited for more players to arrive.  The player base sadly is now even worse.   I would get a refund on this game if I could.	----->	-11

42041032	Don't let the simple premise of this game fool you; it has a ton of depth. There is always more to learn and there is always room for improvement.If you're the kind of person that likes games that require a high level of skill, or if you love to play games to try to master them, then this game is for you.	----->	5

42116655	Good, fun and sometimes rage endusing (if you play some of the community maps)The mouse motion based strike system makes for a higher skill ceilling than other golf games like Golf With Your Friends.If you want a  challenging golf game, without it being too difficult, this is the game for you.	----->	4

42141737	Initially intriuging, tho soon gets tiresomeSorry guys, but I can see a lot of effort has gone into this, though it needs to feel more real.  The moves, the gameplay, will all feel old after the same routine a few times.Love the devs commitment though - just wish I had saved my cash :(	----->	5
42162383	I like the game and the game mechanic. This is a game where subtle behaviour is part of the game. People who like those kind of games such as hidden identity and other related stuff will love the game. I can understand why people complain about the price. However, it is more a niche game for a certain target group who appreciate the type of game and are willingly to pay the price. If you are interested but not sure check YT to get a feeling how the game works. I am looking forward for further updates and more content. 	----->	12

42229935	The game is really fun. The feeling when you shoot the Spy is awesome, aswell as when youre the Spy and do all your tasks without getting caught. That is a really good concept and it works really well. A match is really short, which adds to the fun. There are endless possibilites how to react, what to do and more. However there is just not enough Content for a 25€ price tag. Also, there has been zero updates since Launch, even through the devs promised to fix certain, small things one week after launch, then he needed another week and another. Im not really convinced that he will finish this game, or that it will take years, which is just as bad to keep the Playerbase alive.Without a playerbase, there really is not much of a game. Especially when its so expensive.	----->	2

42388829	Fantastic game - just bought this today and spent 2 hours playing with my mate on 4 of the available maps.  I believe there are 10 maps in total which can be utalized, but there is also 4 differnt difficulty settings - we've only played beginner so far.For the reviews saying theres not enough content to justify the price, I would perhaps agree, if it wasn't for the amount of replay available!  Every match was different, some we got each other, some we didnt.  Some we ran out of time, some we managed to extend time without the other person noticing.  Overall I'd highly recommend this game and am really looking forward to see what they have in store in future updates!	----->	3

The game is a little bit like hide and seek  the spy must  be complete  missions  but he have to do it very careful and hide  from the sniper   the sniper has to seek and look on the people which one is the spy  the sniper has just 1 bullet	----->	21
42420345	amazing game at first but i can NEVER get into a match anymore... feel like i wasted my money for sure. which reminds me, this game does NOT have the content to justify the price tag, esp since you cant even play the damn game unless you have friends that also have it since youll prob never find someone to accept an invite or send you one.ive played much more than 4 hrs, i owned it before steam.will change review when they fix the matchmakingupdate: its been almost 3 months without any updates and STILL no matchmaking..... update: 2 1/2 years later, still no matchmaking... dont waste your money.update: 3 1/2 years later, still no matchmaking update. still feel ripped off.. such a shame tooi feel ripped off...	----->	-4

42517923	My short summary...Love the small maps, they are lightier in comparison to big maps and have tendency for mind games.Big maps however exhaust you really fast, because you need to keep track of/and memorize multiple things in short time.Playerbase is pretty polarized to newbies and really good players due to small number of players, which is a bit sad because I would like to play the game with players that would be close to my skill level (teaching the game is not a problem, but when you repeat it 10 times in a row you start to grave for challenge, and the 2k+ players don't necessary hang around too long with you if you don't offer them enough challenge, which then leads to this vicious cycle where people wait in lobby for same skill level players). This is a big problem as of now (June 2018), because if the playerbase doesn't start to refresh/grow soon I don't see new players pouring in to even the gap. Which could eventually lead for the existing players to leave or wait for another wave of players.If you have a friend that would buy this with you go for it.Other than that I would wait for some news regarding to playerbase and activity.When I started playing this it had +150 players regularly online,now its around 10-30 players.Now 9/10,potential for 10/10.	----->	-3

42626350	Impressively developed by one man since 2009, updated regularly and since the developer is very very keen to strive for perfection in every part of the game I can safely say that he's succeeded.The reason for SpyParty’s higher price point is its depth. It's the sort of game in which you can invest hundreds of hours or thousands even and still find countless new things to learn, new strategies, better analysis of animations and mind games to develop. Truly fascinating.The game continues to reward you for playing long after the initial few hours. If you’re the sort of person willing to invest proper time and thought into a deep game, it's is well worth the price.I've owned the game since 2012/2013 before it was available on Steam.	----->	8

This game is really fun just to chill take a break from stress or a game that is making you mad.I use this game and it helps me get calm so then after one map I can get right back to playing another FPS game.My rating for this game is 8/10	----->	22
42685860	very nice game	----->	3
42690162	This game is very much thrilling as well as it is entertaining. Every game you play will be extremely unique as it would also be learning from your mistakes constantly. There is always room for improvement in this game, a neverending challenge and thats what i like about it. The skill curve varies so much it is pretty much impossible to master this game. I like myself a good ol challenge.Its also really fun to play with friends. The deception over the call while playing spy is such an amazing experience. This is easily one of the best one on one games on the market.This definitely isnt a game just to buy for a one off game with your mates. Its something that you need to invest in to get the true experience of the game. Id say the real challenge would be in 'experienced' mode, now called 'standard'. The various strategies for both sniper and spy on all the maps are unlimited. If you are willing to invest your time into this game id definitrly recommend it. However if youre for example a game collector and is only going to play 10-20 hourw of the game, it certainly wont be worth it.Great game checker! Keep up the good work!	----->	23
42711017	Great fun, but very unstable. Physics seem to change from game to game, mouse speed isn't consistent. But at least it's the same for everyone! For the price it's a great game to fool around with a group of friends on.	----->	1
42731386	I recommend this game for those people who like games like The Ship. It's all about watching people and being able to tell your target apart from the rest. There are always at least a few people playing at any given time, so hopefully once the game gets out of early access there will be a larger player base.	----->	8
42745979	Fidel Dungeon Rescue is basically a puzzle roguelite that feels like it would work really well on phones, though it's PC only for now. You control a cute little dog heading through a randomly generated dungeon, I think to rescue your (human) Grandma, though there isn't much in the way of story here. Each level has you start on one set of stairs and challenges you to earn a certain amount of XP and then head down the other set. You gain XP by just walking into monsters, but each time you do so you lose a heart - walk into a monster with no hearts left and you die. Luckily, medikits are liberally sprinkled around the tile-based dungeon floor, and each one fully heals you. This would make things pretty easy, except you're trailing rope behind you so you can't cross over your own path, a bit like a turn-based Snake. On top of that, there are different enemy types who can't simply be walked into - for example, three headed turtles have to be approached from behind - traps that can be deactivated by switches and more.As well as opening the level exit, getting enough XP will level you up, giving you an extra max heart. Levelling up before the boss levels is pretty important, so you'll want to try and get more than the minimum required XP on each level, and trying to figure out the best path is a pretty fun puzzle. You can also choose which stairway you start on, and there are coins to pick up that you can spend to instantly use a bomb or a health potion. Importantly, while you can't cross your path you can backtrack, which undoes the moves and restores your hearts/revives the monsters etc. Dying isn't immediately game over either, instead it spawns a ghost that starts at the entrance stairs and follows your path, finishing your run if it touches you. He also shows up if you take too long solving the levels, though the limit is pretty generous, at least as far as I've played - it just stops you spending forever trying every possible path. Each level is short enough that dying doesn't feel particularly punishing anyway, you can just jump straight back in.The puzzles are all randomly generated in terms of monster and item placement, but there are a set number of level layouts that do start repeating pretty quickly. On the other hand there are also unlockables, and enough challenge that it seems to last most people about 15 hours from what I can see, and the random nature means you can always come back for more if you like it enough. The art is cute and the music is pretty good, although it doesn't do fullscreen very well. I prefer it in a window anyway, it makes a very good coffee break game. Simple to pick up and play but challenging enough to satisfy your milder puzzle cravings, Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a game I'd say is easily worth a look.	----->	32

42985571	Super fun card game, it's suprisingly interesting and strategic. I say surprisingly because if you just look at one match you might (I did) think it's just about throwing every minions in the arena and the most overpowered will win, but when you play it it feels nothing like that, espicially in 2v2 IMO. Additionaly, it avoids lots of flaws from the GC genre.I love FORCED universe and bestiary, playing the different cards actually makes you feel something, it's hard to explain but those monsters have personality in their design, which makes them kind of endearing ! Especially when you already play the previous games.Conclusion: Great job BetaDwarf !... way underrated unfortunately... maybe if your communication was as great as your products your games would be more noticed, because that's the kind of game that could be a hit on twitch and get a lot of gamers to follow the trend. It's easy to pick up, fast to play and addictive with a very reasonable pricing. And the connection between your games should lead people from one game to the others.	----->	17

Then i remember that im still inside my parents' dark, cold and anxiety-inducing basement, fruitlessly wasting my life away hitting virtual golf balls with virtual aquaintances who will never have any real impact on my pointless existence. Now that I think about it Golf It might actually be a metaphor for life itself. We begin at the start with many obstacles in our path, one by one we overcome these challenges and eventually reach our end goal only to realise that there was a much easier path to our destination that gifts us with more benefits and enjoyment, although, in the end no matter what path we take in our reality we all end up in the same position. A hole in the ground.Outstanding story, very thought-provoking and emotionally resonant. Not to mention the superb graphics and vast open world. An easy 9/10 in my books.	----->	7

43359171	More than fun gameplay, a lot of stuff to do and collect and it's easy to pick up and play and with the recent updates the graphics look amazing. I can also honestly say the game always felt rewarding and never felt like a waste of my money, if you're not gaining more minions or resources to have more deck possibilities then you're always making a new strategy that's even more potent than the last, because the sheer despair and helplessness of your opponent as you deal the last blow is completely addictive and winning is so satisfying for that. There are cons though and though i feel that it isn't neccesary to have, there are dlc's that have to be bought that really do help to have especially after the last few updates. Those are the premium upgrades and the premium battle pass, both in which help you get resources, masters and cards faster. I will say the hard work you've done to grind something out is always less than what someone who bought the premium upgrades would have in half that time you put in, especially in regards to the battle pass, ALTHOUGH none of which affect ability or win rate so it's cool.In general the game is an awesome cheap and soon to be F2P game and if you've got the time the game is completely doable without buying a thing unless you want the premium edition.	----->	23

43395604	Oh, SpyParty, SpyParty, je jen málo online her pro dva hráče podobně intimních. A přesto máš jednu z největším propastí mezi interakcí ve hře a mimo ni. Nikdy jsem se necítil ve hře tak osaměle jako špión na párty, kde je ostatními pozorován a čeká se, kdy udělá chybu, kdy poruší etiketu, kdy ho za to sniper tvrdě ztrestá. Nikdy jsem tak důkladně nezkoumal každý pohyb lidí na oslavě, každou jejich grimasu, s kým se baví, čtou? Jak často a jak rychle pijí? Nikdy jsem při zmáčknutí spouště nebyl tak často nejistý. A přesto jsme jen na začátku cesty. Až se líp seznámíme, až spolu projdeme jednu z nejzajímavějších učících se křivek, až mi dovolíš nakouknout do tajů každého hosta, potom budeme párem na celý život.Pro: komunita s rodinnou atmosférou, neuvěřitelná hloubka hryProti: horší přechod mezi beginnerem a itermediate, chybějící matchmaking	----->	0

43452379	Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a bit like Crypt of the Necrodancer. Not so much in terms of gameplay (Fidel basically plays like Centipede), but it has a very similar way of being more complex than it appears at first glance: tons of little rules and tricks to discover, new situations and enemies that require the player to adapt in order to find the best possible path, and new modes once you've beaten the first playthrough.It's also extremely cute, hides a ton of really cool secrets and the dog can bark.	----->	3
43472667	Okay, if you're reading this, you're off to a good start already. I want to start off by saying this is quite possibly THE best game I have ever played. It is very simple, but at the same time has so many hidden depths, you never really stop learning. When you lose, most of the time you can either already know why, or you LEARN why, and adjust for it. There are players with tens of thousands of games played, and they will tell you they are still learning as they play. It is unbelievably complex. It's NOT a party game as some people say, it is probably closer to Chess. Seemingly simple, unbelievably in depth.But here is the number one tip:AT THE VERY LEAST, PLAY THE TUTORIAL.This game is HARD. It doesn't matter how good you are at other video games, this one has got a HIGH barrier of entry. You will not understand what is happening. As the sniper, you won't see a thing and still lose, and as the spy, you will get shot for reasons you haven't even considered. There is a lot to learn, and whilst the game SEEMS simple, it is incredibly complex. If you dive into the deep end too quickly, or if you stay in the shallow end for too long, you won't get the full experience of the game. Anyway, here is a quick rundown:- PLAY THE TUTORIAL. I cannot stress this enough, it's a really good entry point and teaches you the basics.- BEGINNER MODE IS NOT THE FULL GAME. It's not even HALF the full game. It's probably closer to a quarter of the game, if that. There's 8 total missions, and not only does beginner mode only have 4 of them, you don't even have full versions of all the missions either. It's also missing half the maps. That's not to say it's bad, it's a VERY good entry point, but you will want to move through this one RELATIVELY quickly once you get the hang of things. If you are bored of the game but haven't even gone past Beginner, that is why.- Intermediate is BETTER, giving you access to (I think?) every mission, but again, it's not the full version of the missions you get in Standard. Intermediate is about half the game, and is good place to stay on if you're still finding yourself overwhelmed as the Sniper, though it can bring bad habits if you stay on it too long.- Standard is where everything falls into place. Things like statue swapping, or purloining the guest list no longer point out who the Spy is, it just shows where the Spy has been... or they COULD still be there. Bugging the Ambassador can happen whilst moving, so are a lot harder to keep track of, and the Spy doesn't necessarily need to talk to contact the double agent. It becomes a LOT more about mind games, trying to do things right under the Sniper's nose, and making calculated risks.It takes a while to get there, though, and if you're not willing to put in the time (It honestly only takes half an hour every other day, it doesn't need to be a game you play for 6 hours in one go!) then that's ok! There's just a lot of people who don't realise what they're signing up for, get overwhelmed, and wrongfully call it a bad game, or people who never switch off of Beginner and say the game is one dimensional.This is not a game for everyone, but if it IS for you, you'll stack up hundreds of games of it.As one final point: The community is absolutely fantastic. They're all very welcoming for new players, willing to teach you (if you're willing to learn), and is diverse + welcoming to anyone. You can join the discord if you want to talk to players before you buy, or check out most twitch streams (as long as they're not new players) and both the viewers + streamers will be willing to give you pointers here and there. We all love the game, and want to share it with other players, so don't be afraid to ask questions, and scout it out before you buy.	----->	12

43514638	This game will take at least 4 months of hardcore gaming befor you get any weapons worth playing with, unless you are willing to pay for them and even if you do pay you wont have the parts to make the things you want. Crafting rides is both fun and easy to lean once you get the parts. The balance of the game is not quite right yet but it is starting to get fair. PvP is the best bit of this game and you had better like it because you will need to do a lot of it to progress. PvE is a bit dull and you will need to do some of it to earn more.As a new player you may find that longtime players have a big advantage over you because of your lack of good weapons.All that said it is a good game that can be a lot of fun if you are willing to grind and grind.6 out of 10 Could be better.	----->	21
43516830	Oh I'm super bad at Fidel Dungeon Rescue but the game is damn good. The new enemies introduce mechanics at a good pace. You need to be incredibly careful about every move!

43517238	This game is soooo much fun!The game play is unique and challenging, and just the kind of game I was looking for.

The experienced players try to teach and advise new players on how to play the game. Which is awesome when you look at other communities you will find like 1 person in 1000 willing to help. Players help each other, everyone is the same in this game. Nobody is toxic or salty, finally an online game where younger gamers aren't put down or even bullied. I gained like 6 new friends in this short amount of time. (4 hrs) Even though there are many maps I would LOVE to see some more added into the game, like a city or park or something like that. It is really impressive that 1-2 people are working on this game. I will love to see this game getting even better and better. :)Big thanks to the developer for making this game	----->	32

43653565	You can bark by pressing CTRL. 10 out of fucking 10.Jokes aside, it's a cute roguelike puzzle game. You earn EXP by defeating enemies, you can do combos, and some enemies have to be dealt in different ways than the usual.

43688037	I'm not sure what I can say beyond what other reviewers have already said better, probably.   A simple concept, infititely complex gameplay.   Small, but friendly and helpful community.  I can see this being a casual game amongst friends if you're new to it, but once you get better and move beyond Beginner mode, it becomes super competitive and very deep.	----->	11
43691535	This is sort of a prickly game, but every aspect of it is designed perfectly for what they were trying to do. It's a roguelike puzzle-game, with the focus on finding a way to maximize XP in ecah level by carefully plotting a path through enemies+items. It requires you to really engage with every puzzle if you want to win the game, so it may not be for everyone.Game mechanics are all simple and self-explanatory (in fact there's almost no text except for menus), but they combine to make very tricky puzzles. There's a good variety of enemies, introduced at a steady pace, who all bring a creative twist that you must account for.The difficulty is very high, demanding you do well on every level or you won't be able to beat the later ones (especially the brutal boss levels).The game also has a great soundtrack+aesthetics, and lots of neat extra modes you unlock once you beat the main dungeon once. (There's unlockable characters with new mechanics, hand-crafted puzzles, daily challenges, a second dungeon that functions as hard mode, another short bonus dungeon, and more). So even though the main quest isn't that long there's plenty of replay potential.I literally cannot think of a single thing I can point to as a flaw. It's not necessarily my favorite game ever, but it knows what it wants to be and every detail is perfect for getting it there.	----->	21

43825186	Today, it's not worth it. It's not the bugs or lack of playerbase that does it, it's the incredibly high price. For 25 dollars, you are getting a mini-game that takes 5+ mins to find players for, unless you have friends who also own the game. Unfortunately, when you price a game at 25 dollars, it's hard to convince friends to play. I would avoid writing this review if the Devs gave it some thought, but they have repeatedly stated that they will keep the price tag, and maybe even increase it once out of Early Access. As good a game it is, it's small, and I mean it. Not only that, trying to find a match for the first time feels like you're in  the first PC ever built. It's unpolished, unclean and another problem that needs fixing before launch. Yet, I have high hopes for the future, maybe once matchmaking gets released I'll give it another shot, but for now I have decided to put it behind me.\If you found this review helpful, go ahead and check out my curator page, but y'all probably won't.https://steamcommunity.com/groups/hereforthefreegames	----->	5

43898548	For what it is this game has great potential, add more guests, make much bigger maps, and fix up the interface of the game, and you have a twenty five dollar value game, as it is right now, the game is not much, and is fun for a while but can get boring really quickly. Until a big sale or the game gets a better interface and overall play style, it is worth around five dollars, not twenty five. Dont waste your money for something your only gonna play an hour of.	----->	8
43903566	Golf it is an amazing game from my perspective, and I think it definitely stands out from other golf games, I'll tell you why in three simple paragraphs.1. Content:The overall content in this game is pretty good, considering there are golf ball customizations and an ok-ish amount of courses. More are most likely to be added, but there is more to having just those courses. This involves the steam workshop.2: CreativenessIn Golf It, workshop items are allowed to be made in game for the community to download and play. The players can create as many golf courses as their minds can handle, while using objects from the game. Obviously some people may think that even if you can create your own stuff, it may not let you choose from a lot of stuff to place and edit, and I have two things to say to that. First of all the amount of things you can place is huge (plus customizable themes) and two, you can even import your own assets. And that's not all, you can even build along with steam friends if you invite them through the game! So along with the small amount of ingame content, this game has a lot more to offer through the workshop.3: CommunityMost people when they look at games usually look at the quality and quantity of a game. Well, this game has all of that, plus an outstanding community of players. Obviously there are your odds and ends which no one may even like, but overall, the community is amazing! They even have a discord server for players to chill or collaborate.This game is truly amazing, and if you love mini golf, consider purchasing this amazing game!	----->	16

43955313	Very good minigolf game. It's impossible to memorize how to get a hole in 1 one, since you have to use your mouse to swing. It's a more skill based game that requires practice. Fun both on your own or in a group. Highly recommend!	----->	3
43960130	I got a coupon for this game because I own Jonathan Blow's 'The Witness'. Jonathan Blow is credited in this game as one of 'The Elders', so I imagine that has something to do with the gameplay similarity between the two games.I bought the game on a whim because of the coupon, and I've been pleasantly surprised. The graphics are wonderfully well done. The sound design and music are really great too. The mechanics are easy to learn, but tricky to master.Although the surface level format of the gameplay is wildly different, Fidel has a strange amount of similarity to The Witness (in a good way). If you are a fan of those types of puzzles, but also want a game that will simultaneously scratch your dungeon-crawling itch, then this game is a good buy!	----->	13
43967216	Friends of mine play every night and we talk on the phone playing. Its hilarious to hear each other whine in agony on a missed shot. The basic maps are good, and the player created maps are mixed bag of fun, some good, some bad and some just different. its great to see how creative players can get when designing a new map. The only maps we arent big fans of is the anti gravity ones, but we play some anyways out of pure boredom. Don't worry if you stink at first, we all did at first, it takes a little time to get used to judge how hard to hit the ball and how to use the bank shots. Hint, if you ever played pool games those bank shots will help you in golf it.  Very fun game with loads of options like colliding balls, long shot times (heck you can go like 15 mins per hole if you wanted!) and the ability to practice a specific hole if its troublesome to you. You can even put 100 shots on practice to practice a hole 100x in a row and master it.  You can also increase the difficulty to hard (takes away the cursor to line up shot) and try to get on the leaderboards. They also have the option of using clubs or just the putter like real mini golf. Some player created maps require the clubs as they are modeled after REAL pro golf courses, they are fun. With  Exclusive hats, trails  flags, and  skins to change the colour of your ball. The legendary skins are very unique and fun, you sell your old flags, hats and trails to save up the coins to buy the skins and that is the best part of golf it.   While its got some bugs to work out, especially on player created maps, on the whole it is a very fun game that will have your friends in stitches. Just be patient with your skills, it takes a little time to get good, but everyone was a newbie once,. Play for fun and before you know it, you might be the next tiger woods of golf  it!	----->	24

43977633	First off, this game is good. It's led to some frustrating and tense moments with my friends I haven't felt gaming in a long time. I have no regrets about the price tagOn the subject of the price tag, DO NOT let it deter you. This game was born and developed by only one guy who quit everything to work on this, throw him a bone. PROS:Refreshingly unique concept.Spy and sniper are both enjoyable to play.In active development.Spy and AI mechanics blend very well together.Even after playing every map multiple times the games are still fresh.BANANA BREADCONS:Graphics leave something to be desired.Limited mapsLimited missionsAgain, def worth the price tag. 	----->	-5
43980376	Very cool little game, looks beautiful and simple but it is more complex than it looks. Interesting puzzle and get quite challenging really fast, starts easy but difficulty level goes up with every new level so you have to think harder with every new try to get further. Really nice, better than I expected :)	----->	7
43981708	Absolutely love this game already! I have seen some reviews saying the game is simple / boring but I can guarentee this is not the case. The game is easy to play but can require extreme skill if you decide to face a top player. I would definitely recommend it as the community is the best I have seen in any game ever. Everyone is friendly and welcoming and you can join the discord server to make suggestions or make friends. Great for casual or competitive and I would definitely recommend checking out youtube clips if you aren't sure about getting this game as you can see the amount of fun this game creates but also the competitive side if you want to go down that route. Many intermediate and experienced players, are always happy to help you out and give you tips to take your game to the next level if that is what you require.If you are still unsure about getting the game, I would 100% recommend joining the official discord and speaking to some members and I am certain you will purchase the game. Easily worth every penny and more!	----->	27
43984787	I really don't want to leave a negative review of this game, because for the first few hours (and after some time away) it is fun.

44036371	Pros:+ Gameplay is quite creative.+ Fun for the first few hours playing.Cons:- The game itself sometimes makes me feel like it's just a mini-game and I get bored real fast.- The price tag is way too high.- Not many people playing in the server. This is a PvP game, you can't play alone.And the biggest cons is that this game isn't optimized. It's just a room with more than a dozen people and my computer that can run Spiderman 3 with a whole view of a city and cars everywhere with 100 fps can't even hit 45 fps in SpyParty. Is it a joke??? Reported the problem to the developer and he decided to ignore it. Like, he admitted that he renders everything poorly, but here, in the system requirement: 'Processor: Celeron' 'Graphics: Intel HD 3000'And this, 'Additional Notes: I develop the game on a really ancient laptop to keep myself honest and keep the game running fast on low end hardware, so it should work on quite old computers!'Sorry but I don't think you are telling the truth. An i5-4200u laptop with GT 740M can't reach 45 fps (37 fps in larger maps)  in this game. You are not even 'honest'.	----->	-1
44042053	This is a dumb little steam game that is WAY more fun than it should have any right to be. Get 4 copies, give them to your friends, then have far more fun than you ever would for any other $36 dollar game. I've already gifted to MANY friends just for more discord fun.	----->	3

44060383	Videogamedunkey (Youtube guy) recently played this game. I immediatley bought it after watching his video and it has been the first game I have really enjoyed in a long while! I played this with my girlfriend and it is definitley the best multiplayer between a couple. I understand that the game was only developed by a couple of guys? well I am very impressed! I highly recommend the game and if you're reading this, it was money well spent!!!I give it 10/10 for concept10/10 for gameplay9/10 for content (only 9 as I know that this game has huge potential, especially if it has expansions or moved to an application platform, android and OS)	----->	6
44061214	Saw Delirious playing this on Youtube, so my brother and I decided to try it out. Now we're obsessed with it! Cannot get enough of it. We stayed up until 1:30 am all tonight playing it together. Can't wait to get up tomorrow and play it again. I never knew I wanted this kind of game until I saw it, haha.	----->	4
44068483	Bought it for me and my 5 year old nephew and ended up only playing with his dad for 45 hours(not back to back) and we slaughtered most people just trying to have fun.Pros-You COULD play it with younger family members-Cons-loot crates(you can earn new units from in game but it's pushing a pay to win system)Recently came back and this game is a bug riddled messIt overall isn't a bad game but only really play it if you are bored	----->	-2

44090834	This game makes no sense. The rules are not explained (which I generally like), but you're discouraged from learning them, because you can only do so by dying and starting over. On top of that, the fact that the levels are randomly generated makes it a very hit-and-miss experience. The same level can be trivial or extremely hard (sometimes, literally impossible), which makes learning to play unnecessarily frustrating.	----->	-2

44123366	Golf It! is the newest generation of games to take an old formula for PC gaming and breathe new life into games that are structurally fair, but out to frustrate you. If you decide you have too many friends on your Steam friends list, add them to a lobby to play a course or two. Be sure to enable collision to hasten the friend loss progression. And of course, you have custom maps that seperate the creators set to destroy your self-esteem from the first timers who are just learning skin swaps and somehow still destroy integral parts of the course needed to progress.	----->	-15

44224958	love this game, but its a pain in the butt to rank up. the devs need to make win streaks collect more pts towards your ranking for that season. that way i dont have to play 100 games just to get to plat. like right now im probably like 10 wins in a row and still bronze, with no loss this season.. put me in plat already lol i need a challenge.	----->	12
44236598	This is a nice relatively balanced game. If you look at the leaderboards it shows you the decks used by the top ranking people and it is all diverse, unlike most ccg/ tcg games both digital and real. Devs seem to keep up with the meta and update individual things accordingly. Cards are accessible without microtransactions. The main thing to spend real money on in game are characters and skins. There is not a huge need or bonus from spending real money on cards because even legondaries are quickly obtainable, I got 3 within 20 hours of play. Small deck sizes (10 cards) help allot of issues both in needing cards to be good, and make the game more about the flow of your strategy. When, where and what order you summon your minions matter much more than what cards you own. It is all about formation and finesse, which keeps commons relevant and strategy crucial.	----->	9

44255180	This is one of the best competitive games two people can play against each other. It is an amazing feeling fooling your friends or catching them when they're caught. If this seems like something that would appeal to you, I can heartily recommend the game.I would love to give it a positive recommendation, because the gameplay is deep and satisfying enough to merit a lot of play. Sadly, the price keeps me from recommending it -- not only does it limit the number of people you can play with in matchmaking, but it also makes it exceedingly difficult to get your friends to take the plunge. There needs to be some kind of system in place that allows folks to play with friends who don't yet own the game (especially if the devs insist on keeping the price as high as it is).	----->	20

44390387	NB: I've played the game since 2014 (username: billtowin) and I've got around 50h of playtime.SpyParty is an asymmetrical 1v1 competitive game in which one player plays the Spy at a party filled with NPCs partygoers, the Spy must perform spy-like actions without being found out by the other player who's playing the Sniper who's watching the party from a safe distance.Pros- Unique: the concept, the asymmetrical 1v1 gameplay and the beautiful art design.- Stays interesting through dozens if not hundreds if not thousands of hours of play.- Replay system is the best I've seen in a game and is amazing for mastering the game.- In development since 2009, it exudes polish.Cons- Low player count can be rage inducing when you're looking to play.- In-game UI needs some work, I'm hoping sooner rather than later.If the game's premise seems interesting then you likely won't be disappointed by SpyParty.	----->	15

44524748	Very well optomized and it looks fantastic. Kudos to the developers for making a game that actually supports multi threaded processors. Using an r5 1600 my cpu usage is about 60% and and when looking at my individual threads they're actually all being used more or less equally! No two threads at 100% and 10 at 30 or less. My gtx 1070ti is usually between 85-100% usage and the game is buttery smooth. Only complaint might be that since I have a dual monitor setup, sometimes I'll click out of the game without realizing it as if it was running in fullscreen windowed (which I haven't looked into) but it does not mess with gameplay so no biggie. Game looks as good as I would expect from a golf game running on ue4 so that's nice. Major kudos to the entire dev team they are very talented and made a game truely worth playing.	----->	7
44531016	Amazing value for the price. Built-in maps are few, but decent. User created maps are plentiful and tons of fun. I highly recommend that you familarize yourself with the Steam Workshop to get the best out of this game (it's simple, don't worry).	----->	5
44546625	Very interesting take on the game of golf with unique and interesting swinging mechanic. I'd recommend it to those of you who wants to swing the club and have no power gauge.	----->	5

44721769	Fidel is one of the most creative, easy to pick up, and fun puzzle games I have played. There may be precedents to this game (Triple Town?), but I haven't played anything similar (still have to try The Witness). Since there are no in game instructions it takes a few tries to figure out how the mechanics work, but once you do, the gameplay is addictive and rewarding, providing challenging but not impossible puzzles and plenty of extra secrets to find. Kudos to the developers for trying something not only unique but also executing it well. Also, fat dog is best dog.	----->	7
44738933	Very fun, dexterity-based mini golf game. I hate golf games with power bars. In this you pull back and swing just like Golden Tee or Power Putt. Online play is a must, super fun with friends.The course editor is easy and powerful enough to make some creative stuff. It's pretty difficult to make really really nice stuff, as with almost any editor, but fun to just make some holes for your friends.Edit: I've played this a lot. It's probably the best mini golf game of all time, helped greatly by all the great courses in Steam workshop of course.	----->	24
44745568	Очень хорошая игра, довольно интересная и можно потратить пару десятков часов в месяц. Насчет надоедливости, пока сказать не могу, сам наиграл всего 1.7 часов, и так, перейдем непосредственно к плюсам:- Залипательная игра.- Очень подробный туториал.- Простое управление.- Возможность играть с друзьями.- Довольно приятная графика.Ну а теперь обратная сторона медали, минусы:- Пока что только англ. интерфейс, поэтому, людям какие не особо знают англ., будет сложно.- Бета - тест ( да, это не минус, но и не плюс ).- Пока что очень мало людей играет, по выходным от 5 до 15 человек ( 15 человек, макс. кол-во в одном лобби ).- Не особо понятно как начать игру, первое время.- Цена ( согласен, не для всех это минус, но все же 329 грн ( примерно 660 рублей ), не такая уже и малая цена.. ).Ну и вам уже решать, тратить ли эту сумму на покупку этой игры, может и стоит подождать скидок или выхода из бета - теста, но пока что неизветсно дату выхода из бета - тестирования. И кстати, любителям халявы, сразу скажу: Пиратки нету, по крайней мере пока что, и это как-бы хорошо, но и как-бы нет, т.к. мало игроков.Ну и на этом все, всем удачи, всем пока!	----->	0

Its repetitive, but fun to take it for a whirl, stop, and pick up again whenever you need a good distraction without 10 min wait times. Recommend friend coop and competitive play.

44844479	Not worth the asking price, maybe if it was for a two pack it would be more reasonable. Another option would a free client that allows you to connect and play only with people who have purchased the game. As it stands its very hard to find players the times I have been online players have been in the single digits.The game has depth and is pretty fun but very limited in variation. It basically requires being on voice communication with a friend or it is unplayable as the lobby system currently is straight outta the early 90s and has no one really in it ever. There are different maps and customizable objectives but there is essentially only one game mode where one person plays as a spy trying to complete objectives and another person has to identify and stop the spy.I'd really like to see some more features and development in a direction that would both expand the community and offer more value for the steep asking price.Some possible ideas:Integrate support for more then 1v1 gameplay. The easiest to implement would just allow x number of snipers vs the 1 spy. Perhaps there are multiple spies working together to try and complete more objectives. Maybe there could be a 1v1v1 gameplay mode where the spies race to complete x objectives first. Maybe there is both a sniper and an agent at the party with creative ways to eliminate the spy. However it is done there needs to be support for more than 1v1 gameplay so all 5 of the people in the lobby can play together if they choose. Local play via the sniper using a smartphone/tablet Built in VOIP!!!There are tons of option but expanding the functionality of what is essentially a strong party game should be a huge priority. I could see this game being much more succesful both in sales volume and word of mouth press with something like a 4 pack for 50 dollars if game modes that allowed at least 4 people to play together. This would also allow newer and solo players to join games with people with more experience with some of the depth the game has to offer beacuse currently it can be an extremly underwhelming experience as a solo player.good luck homie	----->	21

44886633	I think this is one of those games where you either love it or hate it. For me, it is the latter ... and it is mainly because the game just doesn't really sing to me. There's another negative review in which the reviewer claims to have wanted to love it. I am the same. Technically, it is well done. But there's just no fun factor.The good:[list][*]Quick, pick-up-and-play game.[*]Works equally well with keyboard or controller. I think this may be a mobile game, too, and I can see touch controls also working well.[*]Seems pretty stable, which it should be given its simplicity.[*]Cute pixel graphics.[*]Variety of enemies with their specific quirks.[*]The puzzles work. If you can't figure out the right path, it is because of you, not the game.[*]Experience system that adds more life, and gives you more options on how to tackle each level.[/list]The bad:[list][*]It is just kind of boring ... at least for me.[/list]Ultimately, it is not a bad game. You can hopefully tell from the long list of pros and the one very individually oriented con. The right people will love it. The rest of us will have better games in our backlog to move onto.	----->	6

44906296	Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a really clever roguelite puzzle game, or maybe a puzzle game disguised as a roguelite? Just like other roguelites, it's permadeath and randomly generated levels crawling in enemies, but the true challenge isn't getting to the exit but finding the most optimal path to get there, which is where the puzzle aspect comes in. To survive the challenges at the end of the game, you've got to make sure you get as much XP as possible, which means coming up with a winding path through each level that kills as many enemies as possible and gets extra combo XP for consecutive kills. Thankfully, this is aided by the ability to undo your moves, so you can experiment and compare different routes, trying to balance combos, health, and the need to not cross over your own path. The game doesn't really explain anything, but with careful observation you'll quickly pick up on the rules and how to beat each enemy type (Don't forget about barking though! It's useful for identifying mimics and changing the direction that turtles face).	----->	2

45033364	I got the game just before the price bumped up to where it is now (around $25). I think at the time I paid $15 for it.  It's a pretty good game, but it shouldn't cost this much. Normally, I wouldn't review a game based on it being too expensive, but in this case I think it directly impacts the gameplay - because the pricepoint is high enough that it is locking out a lot of players, most of the people you find in the lobby are going to be very dedicated players with hundreds or thousands of hours under their belt. The manual itself indicates that this is a problem for SpyParty. Often, I will solve issues with matchmaking in this type of game by buying copies for my friends, but $25 is just way too high for that.So that's why I have to give this a thumbs down. If you come to this game brand new, you will probably not have an amazing time. There are threads on the forums here where people say this can be resolved by joining a SpyParty discord server, but I don't consider that an acceptable method of matchmaking for something at this pricepoint.	----->	7

45193758	Fidel is not a puzzle game for everyone. It takes the principles of Snake, gives it a nice cute pixel setting but does not explain any of the changes the developers have decided to make.This has resulted in the game needing a basic manual, an unlockable bestiary and a visible level timer. Movement: arrows or WASD keys. Mouse is not needed for this game.Space bar allows you to switch start and finish points (only found out from screen tip - naughty).control key makes the dog bark (unknown use on early levels)a bomb costs 3 gold and destroys enemy horizontal and vertical to you.a health potion costs 9 gold for a full health refill when you are not near a medipack.you can only hold 9 gold. (neither cost is shown up front, wallet capacity is hinted at with 9 circles)levelling up increase your health by +1 each time. Switch XP to numbers helps you to see when you'll gain +1 HP and a free health refill.Taking too long or dying activates a countdown timer in the form of a ghost. No onscreen timer to show how long until the ghost starts to come for you. This is annoying as dying sends you back to level 1.At no point is there an option to find out how much health each enemy takes from you unless you touch it. (Most enemies consume health when you touch them and can range from 1 heart to a full health bar). Some enemies are safe to touch from certain angles others are dangerous no matter how you touch them.The enemies are randomly selected, so there is a chance you will encounter tougher monsters (vampires/witch doctors) when replaying an early level (level 2).I went into this game wanting to like it, but have come out feeling frustrated due to how it performs erractically.	----->	-2

45273920	I honestly don't know where to ask questions, so i'm just gonna write a review. It's a great game when it works, best played with friends. But I can't seem to play it. I'm stuck on the loading screen and I doesn't load. I've tried uninstalling it and reintalling, but it don't work. Someone plz help me, I love this game but I don't wanna not be able to play it.	----->	9

45278379	A fun blend of quite a few genres, you'll notice influences from several of the bigger multiplayer games. But original enough to stand on its own. Very addictive, especially if played with friends, either head-to-head or in Team Battles. Looking forward to streaming this game in the very near future.	----->	4

45304859	While the base game is rather small the large and active community pumping out maps keeps me coming back to play this small, yet endearing, mini golf game. The customization adds an element of fun and it's a terrific game to play with any and all friends or to just mess around with randoms.Also if you're like me and camp the hole to wait for people and then knock them into oblivion once they get close then I like your mind.9/10	----->	11

45319518	Very good game with new content constantly.  The only thing i think should change is to make the upgraded season pass easier to attain.  It's never good if the only realistic way you can get stuff is by making additional cash purchases.  However this game is not pay2win because you can be a top player with just basic cards, a good build and good card placement.	----->	14

45370475	Minion Masters is a very fun game that is everything but pay2play. You might pay a small entry fee for now on Steam (although the game is free on discord), but the game itself is fully free2play friendly. Sure, if you want to amas the entire collection it'll be quite the grind to go free2play, but you can easily be competitive without the rarest cards, as the rarity doesn't display how strong a card is but rather how specialized it is. In the top 20 leaderboards right now, some of the decks aren't even using any legendary cards. Heck, one deck in the top 20 is made entirely of common and rare cards. It truly is competitively free2play.	----->	13
45384352	This game was awesome!!! Much more better game play than heart stone and clash of clans tower game and magic. The game is extremely well balanced with an awesome announcer and memorable cast of characters and cards. The card system is also well balanced because the expensive cards that cost a lot also consume a lot of resources. There are various counters for everything, so even the strongest card can get countered by a low 1 or 2 ranking card. Game has many variable and strats because of the real time strategy approuch with the atb bar being your resources and picking your main character can change everything on your deck. You will never have a mirror match in this game and it is highly unlikely even in top solo or team rank you will never see a mirror match.	----->	8

45407686	Nice golf game. Enjoyed it allot nice game to play with you friends and the best thing about this game that makes it different from the other golf games is that you can play maps from the workshop so additianaly to the maps they made themself you can also play maps other people created and there are tons of fun maps there.The only bad thing about this game is when you see your friend ball it sometimes teleports like it's a bit buggy I don't know if that's only the case when im playing but for the rest great game.So if your looking for a game to play with your friends Go buy GOLF IT it's a really fun game where you can spend a lot of time with. Endless maps you can say.	----->	16

45441399	muito bom e muito divertido, é tipo uma mistura do jogo detetive de tabuleiro com the sims. todos os cenários são lindos e muito bem pensados, criando uma atmosfera confortavel, principalmente se voce foi criança nos anos 90/2000. os modos de jogo também são bons e te dão controle de escolher a dificuldade da partida, que é curta, dura uns 5 minutos ou menos, então o jogo é dinâmico.só o lobby e a interação entre jogadores que está em construção ainda, ou seja, está um pouco precário, o que dificulta o entendimento ao primeiro olhar mas também não atrapalha tanto assim a jogabilidade, ainda mais se voce estiver jogando com um amigo. espero que no futuro isso seja consertado.comprei o jogo e não me arrependo, amei muito	----->	-3

45496443	A fun little puzzle game involving a dog and some dungeon crawling with a lot of secrets to uncover during your regular gameplay.The movement is turn-based and tiles-based, so you can take your time to think over your next move (be warned, don’t take too much time though).Each level is a room with an exit to reach while trying to get as much EXP and coins as you can to get an advantage in the next levels.In addition to the regular levels, the game got some daily challenges, different puzzles to unlock more dog types that can change the playstyle and some secrets to find in order to unlock new interactions.Also don’t forget to use the dedicated bark button, it’s got more uses then it seems at first.	----->	8

45507013	So here's the thing: the $25 buy in price really IS very prohibitive. But if you make yourself a second account for guests and invest the full $50, you'll find that many of your guests, after playing a few rounds, will eagerly buy a copy of the game for themselves because it IS that good. There's just enough variey in spy tasks, locations, and difficulties to keep it entertaining for 1-2 hours per sit down, and you'll find that you're willing to play 2-3 times a week without feeling bored about it. I do hope that the devs expand (or allow mods to expand) the number of characters, locations and tasks over time, because I'm sure it will EVENTUALLY start to feel a bit old (see Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes), but for now, it's got a lot of good replay value to it.	----->	8

Currently only has five maps made by devs - the workshop has some much, much better ones.Bunch of friends & random people + hard mode + no reset penalty + collisions = good fun time	----->	17

46045256	Fidel Dungeon Rescue is certainly the cutest dungeon crawler I have played, although it's more of a puzzle game.  You play as Fidel, a good doggo looking to help his grandma.  You work your way through levels, defeating enemies and healing damage while not crossing your leash.  Each level is essentially a new puzzle to determine how to wring out the most possible XP.In previous versions of the game, you were on a timer to make sure you didn't take too long to dither about your route, but now that timer only kicks in if you repeatedly take on too much damage (which is eminently preventable once you know the rules of the game).  It's still possible to trigger it if you're incautious or clumsy (like me) but the game as a whole is a ton less stressful now that you can take as long to think as you need.  The levels are procedurally generated, with an algorithm that is well-tuned to make things interesting and varied.The game has a fairly wide variety of enemies and level gimmicks.  The developer has done a impressive job of adding post-release content, including but not limited to daily challenges and two unlockable alternate dogs.  The spritework manages to balance being adorable and unsettling, and I dig the OST.  All in all, this is a gem of a game that deserves more attention.	----->	2

For its price I highly suggest checking it out.	----->	2

46142094	Excellent game at an excellent value. There are few games I have had as much fun playing with my friends as Golf It! The community workshop is quite active and is where the real replayability in this title lies. The editor is also very intuitive, and it's relatively easy to make a basic map or to spend some time to make something truly unique.I also want to say that the developers Perfuse Entertainment are awesome. They are very responsive to comments, questions, suggestions, and critique on their Discord server. They have made regular patch and content updates that have greatly improved QoL and overrall stability.If you play games with friends regularly, I highly reccomend this. It makes for a great break from more serious mutliplayer games and a perfect nightcap after a long session.	----->	20

And for the people who said is pay to win and stuff... oh well, as any game, you need some time to unlock all the content. But despite that, if you are good, you can be a high rank player with very few cards of your choice.Thanks for reading my first review	----->	5

While it may not look like it at first, it quickly makes you play several hours when all you wanted to do is to play like 30 minutes.There are plenty of explaining reviews out here already, so most of the core mechanics have been explained a ton. Overall, the game is definitely worth playing. P2W is NOT a factor here. And even while it may now still cost 5 €, it is already f2p on Discord and should follow sooner or later with that on Steam as well.	----->	6

46775712	A game that never becomes stale! As there is so many custom maps in the Workshop, you will never run out of new maps. And every map is unique, from oneshot/hole in one course to playing the same track the whole game jsut different holes. If you're going to get Golf it, I recommend you to get some friends with you, because this game is much more fun to play with friends!	----->	6

I have bought it twice, once before it was on steam, and then after it was on steam, both times it did not work for me, I would get into the main menu screen (i think) and I would press the join game buttom (something like that) but then npthing would happen and it would not join a game or anything, then it would just freeze up.

46983026	Good game to play with friends. If it was between Golf It and Golf with your Friends, I'd recommend Golf It; the level editor is leagues better and honestly, it just feels better to play. In my experience, it also seems a lot smoother for everyone, but don't quote me on that.Finally, the developers of this game are amazing; they frequently update it and listen to the community. Check out the other reviews if you don't believe me. Should be noted this game is better with friends, though it could be fun by yourself, too.	----->	12

47057139	Coz moge powiedziec o tej grze, najpierw moze zaczne od tego ze gra jest calkiem przyjemna. Nie bede sie tutaj rozpisywal o grafice itp, bo wydaje mi sie, ze jest wystarczajaca do tego typu gry. Kupilem to z kolega na probe, cena coz, wysoka jak na taka produkcje (wg mnie zbyt wysoka - nie jest to gra ktora powinna kosztowac wiecej niz 50 zl) pogralismy i zrobilismy zwrot, ale nie, nie dlatego ze gra byla beznadziejna, tylko dlatego ze content nie jest wart swojej ceny... Mozna pograc ze znajomym, mozna, to sie zgadza, ale po godzinie dwoch bez przerwy juz czuje sie delikatne znuzenie, przesyt... troche jest to meczace, byc moze grajac z kims innym by bylo inaczej, ale nie mialem okazji grac z kolejnym znajomym. Coz, autor sam sie wpedzil w kozi rog, bo zamiast naprawde wywolac burze i zrobic typowe WOW i sprzedac sporo kopii troche taniej, to jest uparta niczym przyslowiowy osiol i cena trzyma na poziomie pozycji AAA i przez to praktycznie sprzedaz stoi w miejscu. Coz, mistrzem marketingu to on nie jest. Wiem ze za chwile sie odezwa glosy, ze gra jest przeciez jedyna w swoim rodzaju i tak dalej, ze warto wspierac indyki i tak dalej, ale heja, stop. Wszystko ze zdrowym rozsadkiem. 50 zł - to jest maksymalna kwota ktorej bym hmm nie zalowal, po wydaniu ktorej nie mialbym wyrzutow sumienia, pomimo, ze mnie stac na zakup tej gry nawet i za 100 zl. Tylko, ze jest cos takiego jak rozum, ktory podpowiada: HEJ, bez przesady... Mysle ze boom na ta pozycje minal, wiec autor troche przespal swoja szanse. Uwazam ze mogl naprawde niezle namieszac tym tytulem na rynku, ale niestety cena zabila te pozycje. Pozdrawiam :-) oczywiscie - NO OFFENCE.	----->	0

47285675	This is the most fun I've had in a long time with me and my best friend. The game can run on a potato, and it's still amazingly detailed. It's led to many gut-busting sessions of laughter and fun.Seriously, this is worth 40 bucks and I do not say that lightly. Buy it, and have a friend buy it, or buy it for a friend, whatever. It's SUPER fun. And the people graphics in the game are 10/10, the facial animations are better than the Sims 4 IMO too. There is just so much detail in this game! My buddy and I want more levels! Buy this game!	----->	12
47286897	While simple on its surface, there is a lot of subtle strategy to this game. Not only that, most of the most useful cards are easy to get. Unlike the mobile games that this looks like, there isn't an obnoxious system where you have to level up your cards to make them strong enough to use. This means that you can actually rank up without spending a bunch of money if you build your decks around what you have rather than focusing on what cards you don't. I reached the top of the rankings last month using a deck of 9 commons and 1 legendary, which is easy to get without spending extra money.	----->	6

47320458	I like it! It's really different from other mini golf games in the way that you hit the ball. Makes it a real challenge. I enjoy that because it makes each game you play with your friends uniqe wether or not you are playing the same map or a new one.	----->	4
47352058	when building my map the editor freezes for like a minute every 5 to 10 minutes please fix and crashes sometimes as well it has crashed like 5 times for me while building my map but since many updates the game has gotten better so now this review gets a thumbs up from me	----->	7
47360625	Probably one of the most fun games you can play with your friends online. The heartbreak, the anticipation and excitement that can come with every hole is just a constant source of laughter and smack talking.

47457929	This game has an incredibly high skill ceiling and the learning curve is not steep. You get as many hours of fun as you're willing to spend. I've never had problems finding matches with people, takes 30 minutes at most for someone to get on, and that's without using the community programs like discord to contact people. 25$ is an incredibly cheap asking price for the 55 hours of joy I've currently gotten out of this game. If you're interested in a game that's all about the one-on-one between you and someone else, a battle of nothing but skill and wit, this game is for you. Otherwise, you might find yourself dissapointed in the $25 you spent.	----->	6

47605830	This game will mess with your head, but in a good way.  It's much more fun to play with someone you know.  There is a learning curve and as the sniper it's easy to be overwhelmed by what's going on when you're first starting out.  If you're looking to get really good at this game, I highly recommend doing some research on what the AI folks don't do.  A spy can take two sips from their drink or just gulp it for example...perhaps the AI doesn't have the gulp action?  I don't know, I'm a casual player and haven't really looked into that theory but hey, it's something for you hardcore wannabe's to think about.  Playing against someone who knows all the tells will no doubt be frustrating, but might prove to be a great learning experience if you're both able to talk after the match is over and they're willing to educate you.  Again, I had more fun playing against my girlfriend who is of equal skill and experience, but I leave that to you.Yes, I recommend it.  On a scale from 1 to 10, I'd give it a Banana Bread.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onvM6dYYTvc	----->	17

47650279	As you've probably seen in the videos above, the game can be summed up as a 3D PC spin-off of Clash Royale. The game is extremely easy to pick up and play. The develepors have described it as easy to play but hard to master, and that is very true. There are a lot of subtle nuances to how each card plays and you can only figure them out by playing more and more.[h1]The Mechanics:[/h1]You have a deck of 10 cards that you can customize outside of a match (just like in other TCGs). When a match starts, your deck is shuffled and the top 4 cards are dealt to you. When you play a card, it goes to the bottom of your deck and is automatically replenished by the top card. Apart from just seeing the 4 cards in your hand, you are also able to see the next card you will draw. Thus, you have some control over crafting the state of your hand and making combos happen more than once in a match.You can get new cards by using power tokens in a roulette-style gambling system. Power tokens must be bought using either gold or rubies. The only other way to get cards is via single card offers that change on a day-to-day basis (usually cost rubies but occasionally some high gold cost offers do come up). For example, 1 random legendary for 16000 gold. So, make sure to save up some gold for those offers once you have a sizeable collection. Along with your deck, you also get to pair a Master with it that represents your life points in the game (always starts with 3000). Each of these masters has 3 perks (abilities) that are either active (card(s) added to your deck) or passive, and are unlocked during the match when you maintain control of the two bridges in the middle of the arena. There are 9 masters as of this review (12-20-2018), and one more might be added by the end of the month. You can acquire masters by spending either blue shards (earned in-game at a steady pace) or red rubies (must pay $$$ to get enough).[h1]Lots of game modes and events:[/h1]In the beginning, you have to get through a short tutorial before you gain full control of the game itself. By level 9 (i think), you unlock most of the game modes: draft, mayhem and expeditions, along with the basic battle and team battle modes. Pairing up with another player is extremely easy; it only requires you to be steam friends with the other player.The devs always have something new going on in terms of events. The events usually have 3 different houses, each of which has 15 keys associated with them. If you collect all 15 keys for a house, you get a legendary card. Keys can be earned by winning prize fights, which is just randomly determined at the start of a match, and by using streamer keys (watch out for those in the global chat!).[h1]Pay to Win?[/h1] [b]I don't think so.[/b]I got to Master league without paying anything with quite a few supreme rares and a couple legendary cards. I played so much last month that I got upto level 75 in the battle pass with only two season gold stars. I had earned 1000 rubies just by way of in-game rewards then finally coughed up 5 bucks to get 200 more rubies to purchase the battle pass. I got so many rewards at once (33 season tokens lol), it was beautiful. This is one of the most balanced free-to-play models i've seen in a while. If you like card games like Magic: The Gathering and Tower defense, definitely check this one out.	----->	21

47775242	Fantastic. Fidel Dungeon rescue is a clever puzzle that offers a few simple-to-understand yet complex-to-solve mechanics, woven together to create an awesomely satisfying little puzzle game.

47779752	Similiar to Clash Royale, but a very greater game and now its FTP i will gurantee you its not P2W,like many others i bought like a 10.000 rubies at start and now i dont know where to spend it.I appreciate the developers for making such a great game.Lastly if you played any games like Clash Royale you ll like it.	----->	14
47789534	Have always enjoyed Trading Card game. Minion Masters combines deck building with MOBA/Tower Defense type of gameplay. Currently at Level 10 and enjoying it so far. Curious about how much different strategies can be used due to the deck building. Very accessible, easy to learn but you can tell that there is alot of depth. Highly recommended.	----->	3

47820591	A highly underrated puzzler with a surprising amount of content. It seems the difficulty of the game's initial release scared off potential buyers but multiple updates later it's much more forgiving, with even the time limit on levels entirely removed. It's still not a cakewalk though, some levels can leave you sitting for tens of minutes trying to find the perfect route.I bought this expecting a small Roguelike to pass the time for a while but the amount of content really provides you with a lot to do. Once you beat the initial set of levels, you're rewarded a second harder campaign, three puzzle modes, two unique characters, multiple secret achievements and a year's worth of daily challenges.If you enjoy puzzle games and want a game that lasts, Fidel is an excellent choice.	----->	10

47933705	I cannot compare this game to any other real time card game, because this is my first and I haven't played card games much before this except Heartstone (turn based), so these are not comparable. Game is fun but can be very frustrating, because it's a card game. You can't choose order of cards, those are randomly chosen at the beginning of the match. Overall this game is fun to kill time for hour or 2.	----->	5
47935004	This is a neat little game, i haven't played it with friends yet, but i would imagine that it's a lot of fun! Also there's an Editor so you can make your own courses! very fun & a lot of replay value for a simple game.I'd just say it needs more default courses, but the fact that you can make your own or download some from the workshop makes up for this.8/10 Would Recommend.	----->	4

47972095	No idea why the fuck this game is so fun, especially with a group of friends. It's become a go-to chill discord + booze kinda game. Unlimited replayability due to the massive steam workshop course catalogue. Not as popular as Golf with your friends, but I personally like the mouse movement for the putter instead of the charge bar, and even though its less polished it's more fun.Also, this game gives you a ton of random garbage cosmetics you can sell just for playing each round, which is pretty cool. You could probably pay off the entire game's cost.	----->	-1

It's also fun to collect hats, trails, flags, etc. I recommend you try it for yourself.	----->	15

48090462	SpyParty is a competetive 1v1 game that has so much depth to it. I've put in a decent amount of time so far and there is still so much to learn about it. There are so many strategies to learn it feels like there's always something to progress towards. The community is very nice and helpful and someone will always respond to you if you have any questions. If no one is waiting to play in the lobby, give it a few minutes and a few people will show up. If not, you can always practice by spectating other people. This game is definetely worth the $25!	----->	10

48135483	Good, simple game. Some of the cards 'seem' useless, but likely have play value for decks that just don't match my play style. Matches are quick, so it's a neat game to hop on and just play a few rounds before bed or something.I will say that I'm disappointed there aren't more Masters. Yes, there are 9, but I do not think all 9 are 'good.' Again, they might just not fit my playstyle. But having played them all (except one), I only see about 5 that make much sense to me. I also see, in matchmaking, some not getting played hardly at all.Rewarding leveling, lots of 'free' content. Not play to win, though free to play. I bought the game before it went free to play - 20 bucks. It was worth it then, it would still be worth it now.***EDIT: So some of the above still applies. My biggest issue is now the game seems 'gimmicky.' All that is left in the upper mid levels are a series of cheese decks - pick one of the top tier cards and just spam it. It gets boring.	----->	5

48247321	This game is pretty straight forward, its a mini-golf game and is fun but can also be frusturating (expecially if your not good at those types of game).

I also prefer this game because unlike the competitors it offers hot-seat local coop which can be a ton of fun as well.	----->	17

48341685	Was a great game. I love the dev. There are a few problems though- few number of players play this game-few player play because the game cost $25 but this isnt a 25 dollar game. its a 10 dollar game unfortunately.- theres such a wide skill gap in this game and it hightened because of the small player base-in addition, they say play this game with a friend to make it easier, and in the end its not worth it for the money.To turn this game around, it needs to be a free to play with in game items sold. this will build the player base. or at least have it priced significantly cheaper than it is right now. I love this game. But it will never have a decent player pool at its current price point	----->	10
48343327	Amazingly original game, competitive trickery. Not a card game in traditional sense but a DUEL game like chess.	----->	4
48344095	Funny story, I marked this game as “ignored” on steam but got it in a bundle, tried it and loved it.The pixel art is super cute, the puzzles are real but since you can rewind, if you are careful, you will survive.I loved figuring out the enemies (many of them have 2 states: will hurt you / won’t and/or will give you xp or not.I read comments about the ghost (when you die, a ghost appears, die twice and the ghost will catch up to you and kill you for good = game over) I will agree that once the ghost is after you, things go very fast (i.e your death) but then again, you prolly get to that point because you moved too fast in the first place ;)	----->	-1

48521312	This game is definitely worth buying. The game is very fun, obviously so with people to play with. There are a hole bunch of maps to play with from the Workshop. Made for some of the best (or worst, depending on who you ask xD) moments I have had with my friends. Alot of rage, targeted bullying, and all out casual banter was made with this game. If you want you can even try making your own levels, and although in my opinion the editor is a bit, clunky, I would still give it a shot sooner or later. This game could definitely get a bit better if it had more players. That is my only complaint, next to the ones above. Other then that, this game is a full on blast. (if you have anyone to play with. You can have fun alone, but the fun factor of minigolf, is mostly playing against others.)All and all a good game. I have much faith in this progressing. Can't wait for it to get out of early acces!	----->	20

48660626	I purchased this some time ago as a 2 for 1 deal.  Turns out to be a fairly solid game.  The card selection could use some diversity, and I'm not crazy about their gem/shard structure for acquiring other items in game, but the gameplay is solid and a good time with friends.  Take your time, strategize your deck composition, and enjoy.  It's certainly worth a look -	----->	7

48692804	This game looks like it got a lot of potential. I like the game play and the graphics. It's nice to build custom buildings. I would recommend to the developers to include all buildings in the build menu example houses. I don't want just to build public buildings. The game is still in Early Access, but from the 1 hour gameplay I have played, it looks great.	----->	10
48693083	Nice game, I was waiting long time! :)	----->	0
48693479	Just a quick hour spent on this game so far, but already it's sinking it's claws into me. The very organic feel to the way you place buildings, plan zones and design the layout already makes me excited to have a good go at it. It feels like something that I've been waiting for for a long time.	----->	8
48693575	Lots of fun, it is unique and fluid. The graphics look good but remember that it is an alpha. This becomes obvious as you play since some UI elements still look low-res, and the game does crash fairly often right now. This is to be expected, and overall the devs have delivered so far!	----->	1
48693886	Well this is a very warm welcome in terms of what has come out of previous city builders. While there have been pretty great ones, this really relieves the itch I had for the medieval setting. SImple, intuitive and straightforward with enough variation in land to really inspire you to build what you want. It runs really smoothly on my i7 8750H six-core clocked at 3.2/core, 1060 GTX 6gb Max-Q, 16gb ram, I turned down shadows to high and v sync off and im smooth except for maybe a frame or two zooming in but It's really hard to pull that off perfectly. This is one of the best alphas I've bought into and has my approval. FOR THE DEVS:BUGS ENCOUNTERED: Crashing almost everytime I queue a worker to work something such as a market stall job, and then when i go to fill the order for the market stall, to say, sell berries, it will then crash.Don't assign a worker until what is required is fully built or met in requirements to avoid crashing until the bug is fixed. Crashed twice in my two hours because of this one bug. Other than this, its been a fantastic experience.	----->	13
48694005	It's an amazing game. Pretty stable, no bugs so far. Astounding for a first day release!	----->	3
48694212	A great state for an EA and I am deeply in love with this game already with the way it is. Not many growing pains. PLAY IT! IT'S GREAT! And really at the end of the day the price is right of this game, normally I do not like spending more than 19.99$ on an EA game but I do in fact feel like I have more than the value of this game for that price.UPDATE: Found one bug, sometimes the special people get stuck inside their own homes lmfao	----->	13
48694987	I previously wrote a review for this game that said I was not recommending it because it failed to load. However, I am changing this because it 1) now loads and 2) runs beautifully! Props to the devs for seeing the issue and working hard to fix it. In its current state (5 Feb 2019) there are no tutorials, so if you want to wait for those then you should, but I'll be playing anyways. Below is my old review if anyone is curious.----------------------------------------------OLD REVIEWThis is the first review I've ever written for any game and, as it stands, I can't recommend it. It's a shame becasue I have been looking forward to playing this game for a while. It only loads about halfway and immediately crashes. Every time I have tried to play the game this happens. I've verified the game files twice and uninstalled/reinstalled it. For now I'll attribute the issue to alhpa-stage bumps, but I wanted people to be aware that this is an issue. Until this issue is fixed I can't recommend it.	----->	-1
48696105	Good start for a nice game. I've only played 53 minutes, and while I see the potential and do recommend getting the game, please understand that this game is still in Early Access. It [b]is not[/b] finished. There is only a basic play guide. Some things are very familiar if you have played games like Banished. Others, not so much. So, while I like the game, I can see that it has a long way to go.	----->	10
48696297	At first I thought the price was a bit steep for an early access title but this delivers more than you would expect and is already really polished.  After just three hours of being sucked in, I can already say it's well worth it.  The graphics are beautiful (the off grid building scores many points) and the gameplay is simple and intuitive.  It's not difficult but I rather like that; it's charming and measured.  The worthy successor to 'Banished' that so many games have promised to be but failed to deliver on - this doesn't disappoint.  There's some unfinished bit s and pieces but they don't disrupt the flow of the game at the moment and there is clealry scope to develop - I can't wait to see where it goes.  Still worth buying now though - which can't be said for many early access titles.	----->	12
48696329	Got hole in one 5/5	----->	0
48696538	Even though I've only got about 20 minutes in gameplay, I feel like I'm going to spend a long time playing this game. Reminds me a lot of Stronghold Crusade/Banished. Very nice UI and graphics. Game is easy to pick up on and has tons of tutorials on Youtube. Happy that there is a mod section too. Give it time for the game to take off, and the mod section will be endless. Only problem I've been having is, the game will crash every few minutes. So far it seems I'm the only one with the issue so it might be user error.	----->	2
48697143	Add this game to the list of games that ruin friendships.	----->	-2
48697409	I recieved the game for free from a friend before its debut on steam, but I enjoyed it so much i felt i needed to purchase it.  Though it may be a tad shallow, it's very fun for people who enjoy casual settlement development games.	----->	7
48697592	Steady improvement so far. Enough content to be worth a buy.Enjoyable and relaxing.	----->	4
48697686	Brilliant. I've been waiting so long for this kind of game to be done so well.	----->	2
48698058	Loving this, a lovely take on the genre!!!This game is my goto game for a chill out, the constant updates (all of which is free btw) have only ever added extra layers of depth to the game.it is now turning into the polished medieval builder it always wanted to be.I am hoping that there will be in future updates a need for guards and soldiers to protect your village from bandits/wolves/goblins/dragons etc (something which the game again hints at).I am also hoping that building walls and fences will become a feature that takes time as at the moment to me that seems to be the only real fly in the ointment.Many thanks for hours of fun	----->	15
48698297	Very relaxing , you just design your cute medieval town from scratch. even it's still in early access it's playable and has a great potential.  You can build your own castles, churches, farms, mines and bunch of other things. I wasn't able to unlock everything as of yet.	----->	5
48698890	Reminds me of early settlers. I love the grid-less nature of building a city, you can never really predict how your serfs will build their little houses.	----->	3
48699032	Took a risk, £25 was steeper than I expected, but very pleased I did. Happy to support the devs through EA, if they continue to build upon whats here with the same level of quality this game will be an absolute must for fans of the genre	----->	5

48701599	[h1]An excellent blend of influences that results in a fun and engaging medieval sim.[/h1]The zoning tools of Cities Skylines, the free-form building of Planet Coaster, the atmosphere of Banished, and a fun and bright art style that makes the game a true joy to play. Relaxing, but challenging. Balance is definitely not fine tuned yet. And there are some strange Early Access bugs, which should be expected. Foundation looks to be a great addition to the genre. I would definitely recommend it to a fan of any of the above mentioned games, Kingdoms & Castles, or city builders in general. This is the best modern medieval city builder I've played, and I can't wait to see it when it gets closer to being finished.

48703594	First impressions for this game are fantastic!Great medieval village builder, and the buildings that have addons are super interesting! The content in the game is worth it as it stands, but if there are going to be updates all the better!It feels like you are really in control of what your village looks like, with freeform walls, and buildings that have some customization, such as the market, church, keep, to name a few.	----->	7
48705083	The amount of playable characters and game modes can seem overwhelming at first, but they're all worth it (I guess I'm still not 1000% sold on zombie dog, though). The new updates made it easier to get some of the harder achievements, and are actually good challenges and ideas to make the game more interesting. I'm a solid 20 hours in, and I'm still getting some good variety of play in the normal and hard modes both. All in all, this is a severely underrated and unnoticed game, especially for the price. However, it is absolutely and unabashedly a puzzle game, so be ready to slow it down and figure some stuff out. I'm just saying, be sure you're into that sorta game before you buy it. Worth full price. 9/10	----->	9
48705936	Game is extremely fun and works well, but as of right now, there's no way to truly earn gold or tools, so you get stuck about half an hour in. Would love to see more!	----->	4
48706053	I've waited a long time for this game to become early access, and from what I've played so far, it does not disappoint! Will write more as I play more, but wanted to leave a positive review nonetheless. <3	----->	1
48706080	as someone who loves city build games this game is truly amazing 10/10 would buy again	----->	4
48706698	It's a good little game; no regrets buying it. It has a lot of potential, and is very relaxing and enjoyable for the short time I've played it so far. I would recommend it if you don't mind some missing UI elements and a very figure-it-out-on-your-own kind of experience (but the game itself is not overly difficult to grasp, so it wasn't an unpleasant struggle to learn).I wouldn't recommend it at this point to anyone who is iffy about early access games because it is lacking a few things, but if this is your style of game definitely keep an eye on it for down the road.	----->	1
48707135	GreatMuch better than i expected	----->	2
48707320	Never heard of it until this Steam release... It's Awesome!Already has a large amount of buildings and things to accomplish. Love the freeform placing.UI needs a bit of work, pretty tiny and not the most intuitive, but hardly challenging to get used to.So far, I can't hardly fault it right out of the gate. If you like city builders and management games, this absolutely deserves a shot.	----->	3
48708093	1 HOUR REVIEWI've only put an hour in this game but with it being a new release, I wanna kinda give out what this game is. It is a very generic city building game. At first, it does start off very slow. The struggle comes more from a lack of a tutorial or a guide.  There is a help menu that is about 5 pages but doesn't really help you get past the first step. BuuutFor the hour I have played so far, I feel I have more of a grip on how to play and progress. 45 minutes in, I am progressing smoothly now and expanding / unlocking things. It's a beautiful arcade style game. So far I have really had fun with it.One thing I like about this which I was a bit lost on from watching some videos was mod support.  The mods are found straight from in the game. No workshop needed. Right now, it's bare with their transfer from Alpha to EA, but its promising.The game takes the hexagons from civilization and throws in the zoning from cities skylines and mashes it together. My only complaint and I'm sure this will be messed with through release is some of the UI. It doesn't feel fluid at times. If you click on  buildings or villagers, they will each open up their own menu. Thus, you could really have 400 villager menus stacked on one another, closing them one by one.OverallIf you are looking for a laid back city builder and have already played some of the other big name ones, I definetly would give this one a shot.	----->	6
48708380	Wonderful game. I've been waiting for something like this for years now. Though it has some problems. Mostly the crashes, sometimes the game crashes 3 times in 5 minutes, but its all worth it.	----->	4
48709080	SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPS!!!SO MANY SHEEEEPS!	----->	0
48709365	Basically a Civilization, Cities Skylines and Banished crossover episode. They managed to take the best of all the games and merged it into something beautiful. For an EA title it's a solid release and can recommend it to others :)	----->	7
48710222	I really enjoyed my time playing Foundation. It's like the game Banished that brings NEW FEATURES like free zoning residential, industrial, and commercial zones. It also allows customizable buildings like churches and castles. The animation of villagers is a nice touch as well. Also there's a promise for MODS in the future.Foundation is in early access so bugs may be found though I've never encountered any so far.It was easy to figure out how to play and the quests that pop up on the left corner of the screen will guide you on what to do next, PLUS there's YOUTUBE videos of gameplay to help. I truly believe Foundation could be a great medieval city builder with tons of replay value. Don't let early access, or negative reviews scare you. Give Foundation a try, it's at least worth a hour an a half chance.	----->	13
48710341	At first glance, pretty neat. It is enjoyable, nice to look at, chill audio, and easy enough to get into. With more playtime I want to see if its worth the price or fun enough to sink hours into.There is without a doubt a lot of potential here. Given time lets see what it can become. It may be too early to tell if you are barely on the fence.	----->	11
48711776	This is a fantastic game. There is a high learning curve as there is no tutorial, but once you spend a little time figuring it out, its a lot of fun and very addictive! This is still an early access game and there are a few kinks and bugs, but thats to be expected. I saw a review for it that says its banished + civ + city skylines and I can definitely attest to that! If you lvoed banished, you'll love this game!	----->	10
48712848	Banished type game, really fun and fresh with new mechanics, good graphics and the non grid system. But currently the game crashes a lot, I'm still gonna recommend it since you kinda have to expect bugs/crashes etc. from Early Access Games, especially when the game just came out in early access and is something that's probably gonna be fixed sooner or later.If that's a problem for you, check back in a month and get the game then.Pricepoint is also a tat too high for this kind of game imo	----->	10
48713141	The game is great, if you like City building and Customisation this is for you. However, I've had several crashes (luckily it auto saves a lot) that can be a bit of a pain. But, none the less I still play because it's still really fun.	----->	2
48713210	Who invented King Arthur's round table?Sir Cumference	----->	0
48713385	great start	----->	3
48713448	Absolutely addicting! This game has loads of potential and you can easily spend days on one save already! I have faith that this game will prove challanging in the future with more development time and mods to go with it. Small bugs here and there but not bad at all for alpha!Big thumbs up and i love that it is moddable from the get-go! Good luck!	----->	3
48714196	Can creators add Bulgarian flag in the game pls?	----->	0
48714533	At it's current state it's a simplyfied version of Banished. Doesn't really add anything new to the table.Monument building is ok, but could do with some cross bonuses or just different bonuses pr. module.That said, it is fun, and in its own right a good game. Lacks options for micromanaging (fx. taxes), and basic overview, and combined windows.It does have potential to excel in it's category, but it needs a lot of work - heres to hoping the devs will turn to the community.Will update in the future.	----->	5
48715351	nice, but no offense, way too expensive for this kind of game :) i recommend it at half price and i'll rebuy it on a deal :)	----->	3
48715359	This game 100% has potential. The back bone of the game is superb, but obviously it is no where near finished. In it's current state it is no where near worth the price being asked for. I love these style of games and can spend 100's of hours making intricate villages. But in the 4 hours I played the game I did everything currently possible. I can see good thing though. Cant wait!	----->	8
48715458	I'm writing this after 8 hours of gameplay after the first 24h from launch...Game itself, is nice and brings something that I've never seen in city builders so far and that is paths are formed naturally by people using the same route again and again. And I love that game mechanic. But other areas of the game, well... Bit lacking in content but it's to be anticipated. Bridges are buggy on D1, saves cannot be resumed, coz game tends to crash after 30seconds to 5 mins after loading up the save. There isn't any big game ending challenges, or I don't think so coz I haven't had one yet.Short version: It's what an early alpha game is, buggy and lacks content. I have high hopes for the game and the price of 20€ is steep for the content in the game currently.Hopefully I remember to edit this review in couple of weeks or after a month to let the devs make bug fixes and give us more stuff, and after that, I'll probably be able to make a better and more truthful review	----->	9
48715518	at Week 67 in game, most of the villagers are stuck for some unknown reason, probably a bug since game is still in Alpha stage but overall the game is fun.	----->	-2
48715550	Early access with tremendous potential! Let's hope the developers stay on track and deliver. If they do, totally worth supporting this game.It's basically a combination of Banished & Cities: Skylines.Edit: after 17 hrs of gameplay I am still very much enjoying the game. It has crashed just once for me and I have had 0 other problems. I am also encouraged by the rapid releases of patches and bug fixes (for bugs I haven't even experienced, but still a good sign). Once a bit more content is released this game will become more and more addicting!Great stuff	----->	12
48715957	Is good, but a little buggy and has unfinished stuff menus etc but of course because it is early alpha. Cool gameplay mechanic though and has the potental to be great depending on how development goes.	----->	3
48716039	I got a handful of hours in on this, I had to look up a couple things on what to do but nothing was difficult.  The whole thing feels smooth and intuitive.Some reviewers say it lacks purpose, what more of a purpose does this civilization need other than to build a temple in my name, work harder and build bigger 10 out of 10	----->	0
48716671	Fun to play! 10/10Had troubles with game crashes initially after EA launch - but those have been fixed within a few hours. Can't wait to see more content, some more different tracks (soundtrack is great so far) and maybe a campaign mode.	----->	1
48717101	[h1]Great Potential [/h1]A very enjoyable game with a lot of potential, the creator has given a fantastic concept and has done an amazing job bringing his idea to life. The art style is adorable and easy on the eyes. The soundtrack captures the feel of the game well too. There are a few bugs, the main one being that many items and pictures show up as (IMG1) and (TEXT1), showing the variable names instead of what the creator wanted to display.However this is worth its value and i plan to get many more hours out of it.Keep up the hard work creator, you're doing great!	----->	13
48717230	Very early game, still needs A LOT of work. High potential!	----->	0
48717813	I had an eye on this game for a long time and until now I was sceptical.After a few hours of playing I am glad that I bought it but I only recommend buying it right now if you make sure you know what early access means. At this point this is an unfinished game in the alpha phase. This means that its not even close to being a finished game. I had none but the game could crash for you. There are bugs but (for me) , nothing gamebreaking.As described on this page, there is about 60% of the content/features missing. The UI is also a mess.If you know those things, perfect.What do you get then?You get a game that feels like Settlers 3 mixed with SimCity and a touch of Cultures. This SimCity part is somewhat small at the moment. You zone residential and other zones and your... Fims will build their houses, grow their fields or gather stuff according to the zone.The economy is all build by you Settlers style and the Footpaths appear where your people walk often.The Cultures (or Banished) part is that you tell every Citizen his profession.Right now its a slow game which gives you that feeling of coziness. I enjoy that a lot and I hope the devs will not abandon this gem before it is done.	----->	8
48717875	Very fun game. Has more going on for what it seems. I am a city building fan and this is just what I was looking for!  9/10	----->	7
48718024	Revised review.....After sticking with it and a few updates, game is much better. Trading fixed, more stable and now would recommend. Previous review.....Not quite ready.Trading is unintuitive at best, very buggy at worst and was my biggest issue. Lack of content is another but is understandable to a degree, but not wholly when the price is set as it is.Just not sure I can see myself working through the issues presently in the game, but am hopeful it should be improved.50/50 whether to refund, may just keep it and look at it again in updates.	----->	1
48718310	A very nice.	----->	0
48718466	Shows lots of promise!  A great representation of an early access product.	----->	3
48718943	Really love the potential. Can't wait to see the devs grow the game. Still very much in alpha state but a lot of fun.	----->	3
48719865	Game 7/10 at best !Worth money if you like this tipe of gameMy advice wait till game is finished, or disscount!	----->	5
48720577	had the crash starting game at first, then i reset my pc, and its all good and working, Sooo pretty cool game that need more work.. but offers hours of game play already... Tutorial wasnt the greatest, but i got used to the game within an hour.  I like it,  just give me more updates dev :) and KCCO	----->	5
48720661	Put this bun in the oven and when it's done you will have a beautiful, modern game drawing from the Anno Series and Zues/Poisidon series that have seen a recreation under Bannished and others.  It's not done yet though so if that bothers you just wait.	----->	-2
48720693	I enjoyed building my village. The UI was a bit hard to wrestle with but once that was done it was very enjoyable. If I had any recommendations, I'd suggest this game should have something more for Soldiers to do... More events in general. More resources to gather and trade. Oh, and more ways to generate money... by late game, if I lost a few villagers that were important, I struggled to generate enough items to sell causing a bit of a downward spiral.I couldn't figure out how to get glass, and trade didn't seem to work in my playthrough.Overall I think the game was well worth my time to play, and I look forward to coming back in a few months to see how it has progressed in development.	----->	-4
48720815	Very rough but very fun to play! To all the people saying they dont understand how to play: that's what the help button is for! Do you really need to be taken by the hand and shown everything like to a toddler? Come on guys, it's an alpha... Of course it's not polished, of course the UI is clunky and some things goofy, but it works, the building placements and upgrades, the themes, the use of the terrain, all of that is really fun and shows great promise!One last time: dont write a bad review because you didnt figure out how to play you numb nut! Click the help button	----->	13
48721119	Game is IN ALPHA. unlike most peasants. i understand this... ALPHA means BUGS AND PROBLEMS. if you cant grasp this concept please do not buy it. if you do and you want to help make it into something great then buy it.	----->	7
48721470	good fun so far. a bit shallow on content. here's hoping they add more to it (day + night cycle etc)	----->	9
48721798	I am truly enjoying this game.  It seems however when I do well though I seem to run into one bug or another right now.  One I did well in the hills but trade bugged and would not let me trade for the last Tool part I needed. Then on a Fluvial (sp?) map there was a massive pathing bug.  Errors that workers could not get to my windmill and gather hut, then when I removed those buildings suddenly no one could get into my church and then an unrelated house!It is early access so I am forgiving these issues but I am very excited for this release. the grid and district free building, the non-linear reward/research in the splendor system, I love it all.  Once you figure out how the trading work the game becomes much simpler and more manageable.	----->	9
48721975	Fun game, happy to support the Devs	----->	5
48722152	People who have downvoted the game are simply too lazy to actually try and figure the game out.Once you've had a look around the difference icons and buttons its a fairly simple game, but it's also a very well done (and not finished) game so the devs are sure too make it alot more detailed and deep . Give it a chance but don't jump to conclusions, use the first hour too mess about and then restart and try a game properly.Looking forward too seeing where this game goes. Got alot of potential.For an early access game i'd give it a good 8/10	----->	2
48722259	First review I’ve ever written for a game but I felt like I needed to for this little gem.It’s obviously still in EA, which has meant that yeah, there’s still a few bugs jumping around here and there, but honestly, since the last patch, it’s played like a dream. You definitely need a beefier setup to run it at it’s full potential but I’ve got everything turned down to about halfway and it still looks great. Already there are mechanics and things in game that I can see being developed and tuned to be amazing, but even for the time being I’ve had so much fun finding my own way through it all. The price is a little steep for an EA game, but I’m of the opinion that once you’re in game and you see the content already provided, and as long as the devs keep up the good work they’ve been doing so far, it’s a price worth paying. Haven’t had so much fun playing a PC game in a long time, keep up the great work! 	----->	20
48722943	Fun little game. Super early access, so its more than a bit buggy, but I think it has potential. Devs are active so it looks like bugs are getting fixed.	----->	3
48723277	I struggled in deciding between recommended or not, and ultimately did just because I think there's a lot of potential here.As it is now though, I wouldn't say the game is broken, per se, but the trading mechanic is so poorly executed and unintuitive that it really makes it all but unplayable once your village gets to the point that you have to start paying upkeep on more advanced buildings.	----->	1
48723621	If you have any knowledge of how a game is developed or what early access means then I would suggest the game because it is Unique in sense, mix of City Skylines and Banished kinda. NOTES:There are bugs.There are errors.There are shortcomings.There are huge shortcomings regarding UI.But as a user who likes the game and genre, I am more than willing to giver my feedback to the devs about everything I like and dislike and hope for the best. If you think the game is not finished but it should be or worth the price then read below, dont buy the game and go cry. Also how some people can evaluate what game should or shouldnt be on early access makes me laugh.

48723941	REALLY enjoying this early access game. Despite not being fully fleshed-out yet, it's a fantastic casual city builder/sim game that allows you to watch your empire grow in a really unique way (without grid-based building). I love how the sims manage themselves (build housing & purchase goods) so i don't have to micromanage every single unit/structure. It's fun to just see how the city turns out! Sure a sim will get stuck here or there, but it's not a huge impact to remove a structure to let them rebuild their pathfinding. In fact I've had very little trouble with it at all.Tutorial system is definitely barebones still. There are items/process/hierarchies required to progress that aren't explained - but i'm treating it as a rogue-like and enjoying trying to figure out the answer. Love having free walls! There's no combat in the game (yet?) so it's purely for aesthetic purposes. I'd hate to spend currency on walls that don't serve a purpose. Only tried out 2 of the 4 or 5 biomes so far and looking forward to exploring the rest. 	----->	10
48724388	I put a thumbs up because the game is nice.  But, it's (I hope) an alpha early acces.  So 30$ is far to much.  I didn't play much because I want to get refund, I will surely buy it back when it will be more advanced in developpement.  In it's current state, 10$ or 15$ (max) I would keep it to support the dev.Hope they will continue the good work because it think it could be a very nice game.EDIT : Ok, I bought it back.  Played some hours and put it on the shelve again.  Not that I was disapointed, just not improved enought.  And tonight, I will try another shot.  Actualy, there's something in this game that get you coming back.  They're in Alpha state, hope it will lead to something great on release state.	----->	17

48724742	By far one of the most intriguing games I have played. Price is a wee bit on the high side for what it currently has to offer, however, I would wholeheartedly recommend it	----->	2
48724990	I love tropico and have spent countless hours on the beta but honestly? Foundation has kept me engaged far longer. It's a really great city builder and even in alpha state there is a lot of content and very few bugs considering.	----->	6
48725003	The downvote bridge is out hard today. This game is okay and a great relaxing sim. With future updates this will be a lot of fun, still lots of fun now. The maps are huge and you can build on every square inch of it.	----->	7
48725093	This game has so much potential to become the best city building game. Pros: - You can build on hills (my favorite)- You can edit and make your own building design- You can have troops to provide safety to your people - You can draw which lands your people can use- It has Quest System - You can unlock stuff by using points you earned from quests - You can zoom so close that you can see what your people doing - They are fixing stuff on constant basis - They have Great community admin - Unlimited potential Cons:- Some bugs not major (keep in mind its Early access) - Trading not clear (But I assume they will fix it) - Food variety is very limited (But I assume they will add more) Overall I recommend this game if your into city building for sure. I give it a score of 7.8/10	----->	6
48725599	It's good, but it's early access, so there are bugs. There are minor ones, and few kind big ones.(If you read other reviews you'll probably figure out what most of them are. I got it on sale, and i got the music pack. I saved 4$. If you have a spare 30$, maybe buy this game. The price in my opinion, is a little steep. If the price only increases by a few dollars by full release, I think it would be worth it. So if you want in now, go ahead. But (maybe) wait until full release.	----->	8
48725607	One things that stands out in this game is just how NATURAL everything feels, there's no house building blueprints so it relies on a zoning mechanic for 'residential' houses so homes are built organically as settlers arrive, path ways are and roads are created on how well traveled a particular route is  even by other trade cities and resource management is simple, there's beutifully well crafted animations and building design is unique and aesthetically pleasing, the music too is relaxed and enjoyable set in a 1600's. there's plenty of buildings to keep you entertained for hours my first play through is just shy of 4 hours. and ive practically built everything there is but this doesnt mean you wont have a wealth of freedom creating your own MAJOR buildings like, Your Own home (lords Manor) which comes with its own benefits, a Keep that offers special missions and and Churches that increase the number of people able to worship depending how big you want to build, all these buildings come with a  core blueprint and several different addons that simply socket themselves to the core and expand, the only limit is how creative you want to be, which i think in itself is unique and if done with teh right modding support could truely transform this game.     If you like the zoning mechanic of city skylinesthe resource managment feel of Anno 1602 the aesthetic nature of games like Settlersand the creative aspect of strongholdthen deffo try this game one thing id like to see is some sort of impending doom, disasters, specail (weird) quest objectives. invasions and maybe a an actual indepth battle mechanics, like artillery, archers.but so far its deffietly in the running for a more child friendly, user freindly and casual friendly sandbox city sim. if it wasnt for Ancient cities id say this could be the best release this year maybe the last 5 years. Kudos devs, kudo's.   *BUYER BEWARE* however this is an ALPHA game so expect there to be bugs especially after the 120 person mark, had 2 crashes that i'm yet to figure out why. but these didn't ruin my experience thank the lord for auto saves. :)	----->	27
48726596	This game adds a lot to city building with modular buildings. church too small, JUST ADD TO IT!not enough gold storage, JUST ADD TO YOUR MANOR.beware, it is not as easy as city skylines, but the complexity seems to add more for me.i have seen a lot of reviews with 2.5 hours saying there is not enough content, but there is no way to unlock all the buildings without more time in the game.if you are still wondering about buying it, check out the reputation of the creators because good developers is the one thing this game will need to justify the price. but it has been worth it for me.	----->	5
48726754	It feels like 10-20% of a finished game as of the Feb 1 early access release. It takes about 8 hours to unlock and experience all of the content and that's including the extra time it takes you to figure out how to play the game. There is no real guidance for new players yet. You have to figure out how to do everything by yourself. I had to restart a couple of times in the first hour of playing because I didn't understand what I was supposed to be doing and got stuck on the small amount of progression this game has so far.In regards to progression, there are some starting tasks and missions that lead to unlocking more buildings, but it only takes a few hours of playing and it doesn't lead to anything else. However, I did enjoy the several hours I spent growing my city and unlocking new buildings.[h1]Conclusion[/h1]Foundations has potential to be a great city builder but it is currently very early in development. In it's current state, the game offers a few hours of a fun and immersive experience, but is also unfriendly to new players due to a lack of guidance. [b]I'd recommend buying the game now if[/b] you are excited about trying new city builders and you don't mind paying now for content that you will receive over the next year.[b]I would not recommend the game if[/b] you are looking for something you can sink more than a few hours into. Wait 6-12 months and I think this game will be in a more completed state.	----->	14

48729960	Bought this game in Alpha. Wow, so much potential. Even in early alpha this game is good. Some bugs and stuff which one should expect at this stage, but already very good.  If you buy now, expect some bugs and if you cant deal with that, wait. I really like this game.	----->	2
48730070	Loving the game so far - I can see a lot of potential for growth, additional content and features. But even as it stands right now, it's a cute, functional builder which seems to consume hours without me even noticing.My only complaint is the little villagers creepy-doll eyes, I feel they may murder me in my sleep.	----->	-2
48731100	The game is literally what I have always dreamed of wanting as a child. I always enjoyed such games but felt like something was missing, Foundations completes the void I was always having with City Building games and it's still Early Access!Pros:1- Organic building is great2- Easy to get addicted because of so much fun and stuff to do3- Monument modulation is insanely fun and no two monuments would look the same4- AI are smarter than I thought they would be in an early access game5- Quests, although they seem linear, are fun to complete and it urges you to expand for more unlockables6- Sheep are OPCons:1- Game runs at 20-30 fps, but it's still early access so its fine.2- My first every game file just kept crashing the game multiple times that I had to start a new game, no problems since.3- Although I said the AI is great, I have an issue with how they either leave too much or too little space between their houses. Sometimes a house gets ready for upgrade and another house gets plotted on top, making me delete both houses.4- I was under the impression that you will be going to combat in real time and not off screen, it may however be a mistake from my side for not understanding correctly.	----->	9
48731220	(Quick note: Steam thinks I've only played for about three hours which is definitely wrong? I've been playing for quite a long time since it came out on Friday)I'm not sure what the naysayers are on about. This game is early access, and appears to still be in alpha, so of course it's going to be incomplete and buggy. I had one save that always hard crashed when I got to a certain date. Another great example of this is that I used all of the wood and time in the entire world to build a bridge that the AI is not yet coded to use once it's complete. If you are expecting a clean, polished, game you probably shouldn't be buying a game in that's in Alpha and literally went on Early Access two days ago.What I can say about this game, is that it does deliver already on it's promise. It gives you the opportunity to make a free form medieval town that grows organically, and it does it superbly well. I have been waiting for a game like this for a long time, and despite the bugs and incompleteness, it delivers in spades. The game is incredibly fun and I can't wait to see it grow and get more content over the next years as development continues. I plan to spend quite a few more hours on it now and look forward to coming back regularly as they release new content.If you like city builders, and have wanted a good medieval one, this is a clear must buy. You'll have fun now, and you'll support the devs so you can have fun later.	----->	30
48731595	A very zen game. I love being able to zone areas for development, then sit back and watch the inhabitants build the town and see things take shape. I look forward to continued development!	----->	3
48732222	this game is so beautiful <3 <3 Really enjoy playing this gameI dont know if there more building or i dont reach the level yethope for dev to add more n more features n building	----->	6
48732716	[h1] Great Game, has it flaws [/h1]The game in its current state has its bugs, but if you are a fan of city building games and managing games you should definitely thinking about buying it. But maybe wait a few patches.There are alot of people complaining about that they don't know how to play. Which is strange because there is a help menu and also its easy as hell if you ever played any city builder ever. (like the settlers) There is not that much to do in the current Version but you can play on forever, like Banished. There are also a few building you can customize yourself and decorate your village as you want, so you can build beautiful villages. The bugs aren't really that bad, considering its a Alpha and the most annoying one is that sometimes people get stuck while doing something/or try to do impossible stuff like going in a closed church. All in all I think its a very nice game, and I can't understand all the negative reviews.	----->	5
48732950	More like Settlers than Banished. Beautiful, relaxing game.	----->	2
48734493	A game with a lot of potential, but remember, this is still in development and lacks a lot of content right now. Don't buy if you want the finished product, because it isn't.The developer is very interactive with the community and taking feedback well, so I believe this game will grow into something superb.Once the modders get involved, this game could grow even further.It's like Banished but with a full 3D view and less harsh (don't expect your entire village to suddenly die, this game is more casual than Banished).[b]What I love:[/b][list]    [*]The graphics    [*]The modular buildings - Design your own churches    [*]The way you zone residential areas and your villagers design and build the area    [*]The way roads are made by the villagers    [*]The fact that so much is planned for this game by the devs    [*]Modding support is already supported[/list][b]What I dislike:[/b][list]    [*]The UI is awful (Devs confirm that current UI is temp and will be overhauled)    [*]Not instantly obvious how to unlock new buildings    [*]Poor control over whether your villagers can upgrade their homes    [*]No dangers in the game, other than villagers leaving due to unhappiness, nothing really reduces your population other than hunger[/list]This game isn't finished, but has potential, if you understand the concept of and Early Access, then buy it, if not, then wishlist it.	----->	0
48735891	i have played dis for a bit and i have a blast with it even tho i suck at it but its really fun and has alot of stuff in itits a great start for the game while its being develept on as there is a few bugs in it and other things like some dont have names and is called male#5 or female#56the price can be a bit mutch as well but overall it is a great game and has a great start with alot of potential in it, grab it if you really want it or wait for more updates	----->	13
48736072	At last.  THIS IS IT.  The game I've been waiting for since the first Settlers!!!  YES!  Already looks great (except for the UI, which is either tiny or huge).  Finally a builder game where the toons make their own paths - just like the original settlers back in the day.  I LOVE THAT FEATURE.Not sure how trading or the marketplace works just yet, tutorial is a bit thin but hey - it's Alpha, right?!With you all the way on this one devs!!	----->	5
48736213	Graphics are brilliant. Game play great. Lots to do at first, but does fade away after awhile. You could build a massive city if you wish. Great game for early access. Well done devs.	----->	0
48736254	Cute and fun game so far.  Will need a UI makeover for sure, but I find it enjoyable at the moment.	----->	4
48736460	Bugs - CheckCrashes - CheckBalance and Gameplay Issues - CheckBad UI - CheckBut who cares ? This game rocks, even in the current state, simply because of 3 things. First off, the foundations are solid. Did you notice ? Citizens accept that walls are ... well walls and not some kind mirage you simply walk through. No matter how strange I arrange my Church they still use the Door I placed and even if I try to build some kind of Parkour they managed to beat it, while still making the paths look natural.Second, built in Mod-Support ? Hell yeah, creative games like this live from their modding community,a new style for your houses, new buildings or even new gameplay elements ? All just a simple click away.And last but not least, Free-Build Monuments like Churches, Castles and such. Seriously, why was that never a thing up until now ? The build tool is easy to use and intuitive. Not to mention, as stated earlier, it works. You do not simply create some kind of decoration, you create a functioning building that opperates differently depending on how you build it ... or well, rather depending on where you place the door .... but it gives you the feeling that these builds are actually used instead of citizens simply coming by to sightsee, like it is the case in many other games, for example Anno.Well now, although I kinda ignore that fact, this is still supposed to be a review. To put it simple this is a game in Alpha, so expect all the things mentioned above. If you are sceptic about the game just watch a stream or Let's play, These days that is one of the best ways to confirm if it is a game for you or not. Personally I have to say this is one of the games I already like in Alpha and have high hopes for, so I will continue to check in every few weeks to see it's growth. A nice alternative to Anno and it's focus on efficency as well as a paradise for Builders.	----->	31
48736492	I have had this game on my wishlist since may 2018 and have been following it since before that. I love city builder games and this one is living up to my hopes!!!!! I love games like Banished and Cities Skylines . Pretty good for early access and I cant wait to see what else they will bring to this game. The building of markets and churches is really fun and is great to scratch that creative itch.	----->	20
48736695	Knowing the game was in alpha I started playing and was pleasantly surprised. Building and expanding your city feels very rewarding. Sadly there is not that much content yet, and after ~14 hours of playtime I needed another challenge. For now the game is not worth the money yet, but i'm sure it will be in the future. Will be following this one...	----->	2
48736744	Custom maps can get really fun and challenging.  Good stuff	----->	4
48736890	Already great fun in it's current state, even when there's still a lot o' work to be done!	----->	7
48737262	Chill fun game that has a learning curve. I had to reach out to the discord for some answers but once I got going I started helping others and that made the game even more fun! It's still in alpha but I've payed more money for less time in a game so I would say worth the price point!	----->	7
48740119	This game is really good so far. worth the moneyz	----->	5
48740389	A medieval simulator :)Love the free form - looks awesome.Very intuitive - quick to grasp. No bugs for me.Design element is very nice for your bespoke castles, churches, manor houses etcEarly access but plenty to do. Look forward to it getting even better...= Best city builder I've played for ages!	----->	4
48740601	It's Early Access and it shows... But it has a lot of promise. I'll keep coming back to this game to see how its progressing	----->	0
48741023	I've been following Foundation for a while now and waiting with bated breath for its Steam release. The devs have created what I consider a framework for a good game. I'm recommending Foundation in its current state because this game, while very unpolished and lacking beyond two hours of gameplay, has an incredible amount of potential. I look forward to seeing it as it updates through early access.	----->	3
48741216	Fun, relaxing, beautiful. Can't wait to see what's coming later on.	----->	0
48741826	For those of you crying about there being no tutorial there is quite a bit of information within the help section inside the game. If you have ever played an early access game you should know that one of the last things that gets done before final release is the tutorial. Don't be so lazy and put a little effort into reading and trying things on your own.That being said this game is awesome so far. I love base/city building games and this one seems like it has great potential. I have just started playing it so I'm hopeful that it has good depth to it for sustained enjoyment.Oh and don't get fooled by the bread icon, it looks very similar to the gold icon. I failed my first mission thinking it was asking for gold, oops!	----->	13
48742392	Absolutely stunning game. It's beautiful, relaxing and i'm excited to see what's coming next. Definitly buy it!	----->	7
48743269	I'm not sure I understand the negative reviews for a beta version of a game.  It's kind of implied that the game will be buggy and there usually isn't going to be much of a tutorial.  That being said, I will play pretty much any simulation game and have a high tolerance for clunky gameplay.  I've put 8 hours in and pretty much reached as far as one can go in this early version (built the monastery but couldn't really go further.)  Once I got the hang of trading, I was able to make some gold and the game progressed smoothly.  No crashes for me.  I think the trading mechanics can be simplified as it is confusing to have what appear the be the same controls in the warehouses and the trading menu (but they are not the same - took me a while to figure out.)  This is one of those sim games that can get really large so you have to plan ahead where things will go or else you'll be tearing stuff down and rebuilding.  I recommend this to anyone that's into Simulation/city builder games and doesn't mind knowing the game isn't done.	----->	3
48743545	Well at the moment I can't even open the game before it crashes so that's cool. otherwise it's okay	----->	0
48743844	Came back to this game after a while. A lot of the early bugs are fixed. I do notice some late game balance issues (or quite possible I'm missing something) but that is a good problem to have compared to game-breaking bugs. Game is still early but it can be pretty fun once you figure everything out.	----->	4
48744816	An exceedingly promising, visually stunning and an amazingly chill game to play. At the time of writing, it does have quite a few random bugs and lacks UI polish. But the graphics are <3 and the building is <3 and the feeling of seeing your little village grow to a town is <3 <3 <3	----->	5
48745222	This game is pretty dang fun. Suffers from a few balancing issues however, like needing 4 wind mills to keep up with 2 small wheat farms. Devs have been good so far and I think it is forsure worth a buy.	----->	8
48745418	I would say it's a great, fun little game, but there is not much playability right now. Better wait for more content.	----->	4
48745709	i am really enjoying there still a few things that need work but the game runs well you can build some nice town and hopefully more things are added i am saying all that i am having fun	----->	11
48745806	Foundation is brilliant. The major buildings being kitsets that you can put together how you like and how the roads and houses grow organlically especially set it apart from the others in this camp of city builders.The art and animation has a nice charm to it.It's a nice and relaxed game that still has enough to think about in it.	----->	13
48746081	After 5 hours of play time so far I'm impressed and pretty optimistic this game is going to turn into a good city builder.I've seen a number of negative reviews that named no proper tutorial and an unintuitive interface as their reason to vote negative. I agree that, at this time, it's not always very clear what you have to do and where you find certain things in user interface but most things really only take a little longer to figure out than you're used to. There's definatly room for improvement here but in my opinion it's absolutely no deal breaker.The presentation of the game is great. Graphics and art style are very nice to look and the music and ambient sounds create a very nice and relaxed athmosphere while you work on your town.The more free form and grid-less approach to building is refreshing and lets you create towns that seem like they've naturally grown. Very pleasing to the eye not having to align everything and having  a lot more control of what you want to build wherever.I really like the mix of building and managing your town and people and all of the base features that are important to a game seem to be well thought out and not too shallow though I do hope to see other layers of complexity for existing features added.As many people mentioned it definatly borrows from some of the best and most popular city builder games like Anno, Cities Skylines, Banished, The Settlers and I'd say they dev team picked and chose pretty well which features from all of these games would fit well with their own flavour of builder.In the spectrum of Early Access releases I'd fore sure count this among the better ones. If I'd had to rate my Early Access experience with this game after 5 hours I'd say it's a somewhere around a 7.5 or 8.Overall thumbs up from me!	----->	40
48747337	This is a fun little city/village builder that is relaxing and somewhat thoughtful. My only issue is that it has crashed twice now but, hey, we're in Alpha right?! :) Aside from nit-picking like the population doesn't breed or grow fast enough for me on 3x speed it is definitely 4/5 Stars as is.	----->	6
48747449	Awesome game with a lot of potential. I really enjoy playing it, seeing my city evolve. However, I can only ever play for about an hour before the game crashes. I hope to see the game evolve and for everything to optimize. Excellent idea and implementation so far. Can't wait for the next releases.	----->	4
48748392	It's a good game. It doesn't really explain everything and that's fine you can figure most of the stuff out in the first hour of gameplay and if you can't just ask around and people will most likely have an answer. The game offers us plenty of freedom when it comes to how we want to build our city, with the only minor setback being that you can't manually place or rotate your citizens houses, you can only assign the space where they are generated. Sadly you will probably run out of content after maybe 3 or 4 hours but that is to be expected since the game is still in development. Hopefully there will be more stuff added as time goes by.	----->	8
48748586	Great game, fun in Beta, and a ton of potential as it continues to develop.  Make sure you read the wiki for tips/tricks to get started (i.e. building a market, setting up trade).  Pretty intuitive after an hour or so of gameplay.  Gets a bit repetitive after the first 4-5 hrs, and not as many 'special' buildings to construct as I would have hoped, but imagine this is all in the works (same with battles).	----->	4
48748943	Very enjoyable in its alpha state.	----->	0
48749396	Foundation is the game I've been waiting for since the Settlers series went downhill, and the game that I thought Banished would be. I've played many village simulators since falling in love (and then out of love with Paths to a Kingdom) with the Settlers series, eg. Banished, Forest Village, etc, but none of those games felt very organic in development of your village; Those games are great spreadsheet games and for number crunching, but not for a fun relaxing game.This game DOES have a tonne of potential, but it is already a very fun playthrough RIGHT NOW, in Alpha!Graphics are an easy 4/5. The stylized artstyle doesn't scream fidelity with every pixel, but flows nicely in an easy-to-look-at manner.Performance is on-point with no dipping or stutter at all running max graphics. (Just don't spawn too many sheep!)Ease of Access: 2/5 There's no tutorial as of yet, so when you jump into a game it's easy not to have a clue what you're doing. Feel free to click around and just experiment, though, it won't hurt a thing; All that being said, though, the missions/quests will help you along the way which is what currently saves early game from being much harder to figure out.This game's future looks bright. Overrall rating, a strong 8.5/10 for the right kind of gamer.My simplified PC specsGPU: 1070CPU: i5 870016 GB DDR4Samsung M.2 NVMe SSD	----->	19
48749430	Great Game, I would add a tut about building a church and buying bread to get commoners. Another about the efficiency of adding warehouses as close as possible to the production site. If it was a finished id say no but the community and the gameplay as of right now for a alpha its Great!Otherwise 8/10 till its done!Cons. Crashes and memory leaks at launch, Turning off Superfetch Helped fps and the patch fixed my issues.	----->	-1
48749584	If you like Banished, Cities Skylines or Sim City, or all of the above. Then you will like this game.Plays very well for an Early Access alpha game.I can't wait to see where this game goes.	----->	4
48750306	Beautiful game, very well done for EA. You definitely see it's EA cause there's missing texts, some resources are in the game for which there is currently no use whatsoever (I'm looking at you, leather), the UI is clunky, tutorial is basically non-existant etc. Regardless, if you like city builders and setting up production chains, you will enjoy your time with the game. Once it's finished, it's probably going to be an amazing game. Can't wait for more updates :)	----->	5
48752097	What a great game. I just love it how the roads form by the people walking where they want to go. In some areas it feels like the game is not ready yet but hey it's not ready yet. It really needs a tutorial though because sometimes I have no idea what i'm doing and why something is happening.	----->	8
48752446	As a city-builders fan, I can only see the huge potential this game has. I'll make it short :Pros:~Gridless and organic city-building, this is really the main strength of the game~Monument-building, really innovative and greatly reflects the reality (i.e. gaining favor points with the people, the King, or the Church by building impressive landmarks for them.)~Really cute graphically~Good pathfinding (an important point for a game where the IA choses on its own where to build houses, roads...)~You can feel that the economy will be the real danger in the future, even though you can't really lose at this point in development, yet you'll often realize you have no food left to sell on the market, meaning no more money to import tools, leading to the village's expansion being halted until you manage to sort it out.Cons:~As said before, there is no real danger in the game at the moment (but I'm confident there will be in the future)~People seem to have a few crashes in forums (I got only one after 5hrs, and the autosave allowed me to lose almost nothing)~The price might be a little high for what's in the game at the moment, but considering that there is only 40% of the final content right now; 26,99€ is actually fine in my opinion.So yeah, I strongly recommend it before the price rises when the game is finished. Thanks for reading until the end.	----->	15
48752613	It's early days for this game, but it's quickly becoming my favourite city-builder. Yes there a few bugs, but it's still more polished than a Bethesda game.	----->	0
48753580	A very well made game even in alpha stage. :D	----->	0
48753754	nice game.mix out of the Settlers and a bit Anno.Good performance for alpha version, UI could be improved. Missing balancing.I'm optimistic it will be a good game, it is alreadynegative aspect, it is too expensive for early access	----->	8
48755417	In my opinion this game is very originally and it deserves a lot.I think that all those people who love this kind of game, they have to try it.I hope that the developers update this game as soon as they can.	----->	7
48755882	liking this game even though it crashes everytime.i just hope on the future updates they can add these things:- night time- raiders? for a bit of challenge?- needs more tutorial for those who are first timers in this kind of game, even i  was a bit confused on the vague quests. No directions on how would i fulfill some of them, took me some time before i figured it out.for now that's about it	----->	2

48758225	The game is incredibly fun. One of the most fun city builders I have played. Though it is in Early Access and released just a couple days ago, it already has a solid [i]foundation[/i], and I am looking forward to future updates with the game.	----->	6
48759599	I'm not going to lie, I've been unable to stop playing Foundation for the past 2 days. It's a brillantly charming medieval city builder with a wonderful art style. It's the perfect melding of Banished and Sim City! I can't wait to see where this game goes.Pros- Fairly easy learning curve- Lovely art style- Addictive and easy city-building mechanics- Music is incredible- Runs perfectly smoothlyCons- Early access so there are a few unfinished things (certain icons missing)- Currently limited options for starting the game (again, it's early access)Overall, I'm incredibly excited to see where the devs go with this - it's a game i can see myself playing for weeks on end.	----->	16
48760265	Addictive and relaxing. easy to forget how much time has passed. The game isnt a fan of my firewall and i've had a few crashes. other than that a fun game	----->	7

48764205	A MUST BUY !!!!!!!!	----->	0
48765101	A really organic city building game, some will remind Black and White 2 while playing from the way you manage space and such. An awesome feature is that you can place anything, anywhere (withing your city limits) so you can let your imagination fly and make the medieval city of your dreams. Being early acces I understand the limitaions in content, actually apart from the fact that you can get a beautiful city the way you want, once you get to know how to get money you can do all content with ease. More challenge in missions and other management duties like a deep trading system would make this the city builder of the year. I'll recommend this game as it is if you want to have a few hours of nice city building, but definetly does not worth the money in content as it is.	----->	16
48765286	A ton of fun with friends. Certainly not easy, and that's part of what makes it fun.A note to new players: a twitching guest should be killed on sight.	----->	1
48765291	Amazing game for early access, as expected there are some issues? atleast so i think ? i find that no matter how many markets and food i supply for the people they never seem to get enough and will leave the town because i dont have enough food, i hope this does get resolved but i have been playing this game for 10 hours in the last 24, cant wait to see the full game! great job	----->	6
48769055	I must say this game is too sick!( That means its awesome). Its been a long time since a good old city builder game like this came out, it reminds me a lot of the Caesar series.  The Graphics are simple and not too demanding on the pc but at the same time very pleasant with great details like the grass that everyone has mentioned. The controls and gameplay are great and the music is also really great and very appropriate for the age that the game is based in. Definitely a big thumbs up from me!!!	----->	19
48771367	Looks very cool!A little on the expensive side if you ask me. The biggest problem currently is that the pathing does not permit to build bigger bases. They make a break ... run to there workplace (one action)... run back to there house/market... run to work (one action)... run back. Takes a very long time if your city is big. A VERY VERY long time!	----->	-2

48775013	I've only played this game for 7 hours but I like it already. I've been looking for games like Foundation that allows complete autonomy to players but follows a certain set of their world rules to create a brand new world. In this game, you are the designer of your space and it is truly 'gridless'. It will turn out exactly as you put down each workstations, each building, and each zone - it could be daunting.The version I'm running allows terrains to be selected and they are all challenging.I would recommend it to all that likes to design the game - bit by bit - as you may say. However, do beware of computer requirements; the game frequently lags and crashes if they are insufficient.	----->	7
48776708	Great Medieval sim builder. Still a lot of room to build on.	----->	0
48777708	Definitely a game to keep your eyes on. At the moment of course, it is early access. Id say around 6-8 hours of gameplay before you unlock all the buildings. (depending on your playstyle.  But what is here is great. It is worth the asking price.	----->	2
48777985	Absolutely fantastic!  I don't write many reviews (almost none), but I had to for this.  Obviously still in Early Access so there is still much missing, but the potential it shows for possible future content and features could turn this into one of those games where I stop playing online with friends.As long as they don't fall into the trap of trying to push out as much as fast as possible and keep going at their current (slower) pace, then I'm certain we'll keep seeing the same level of creative game development.  It really feels like a living town/city.Kudos to the team, just keep doing what you're doing!	----->	3
48778748	Pros:+Graphics/ Art Style+Able to build your Village the way you want to+Seems to be promising with the devsCons:-Very empty world, its kinda like you build and then build some more but for no reason.-Happiness? makes no sense and the interface makes it hard to track exactly what the villagers want...-There was no more missions/quests after 1 hour in.-Very easy to abuse building/farming system.I reccomend this game but at this stage there isnt enough content, altough im sure they will add it in with time. 	----->	-4
48779451	I have enjoyed my time on this game so far, it feels like it has a lot of potential. But it is in Alpha so there are quite a few bugs such as: 1. Buildings intersecting into each other.2. Villagers abandoning paths after building fences near it. 3. When doing the quest to send an army to another town, it does not show the name of that town but something like [Town name here]4. Villagers do not use front door for church, opting instead to walk through the side of the building.5. New villagers with names like 'Male #1111'Lastly, This game needs some sort of tool to mass delete things like fences and to move them. Its just stupid how I can decorate a path, for it to stop getting used by the villagers, later forcing me to delete each fence segment one by one without the option to least relocate them	----->	5
48779795	Wonderful game. Really unique and has great potential. Literally spent a whole day playing! However some bugs were found. When relocating areas, such as residential I think paths block the way for houses to be relocated or reconstructed. Maybe allow a tool to remove pathways to be added? Also the consumption rate for resources happens far too quickly in my opinion, half the time of playing I'm struggling on trying to keep the food demand stable while having a large amount of villagers leaving due to unhappiness. Please check if there is a way to improve on these. Other than that this is an amazing game and I am thrilled to see how this will progress.	----->	13
48780708	This is a very nice game. I've been playing this since the stream release and I'm pretty impressed so far.Not only is the landscape beautiful, the game is fun to play. Zoning, selling goods/trade, research, and more. You can also design some buildings to some degree which I'm sure will only get better.The game has been pretty stable thus far. I did encounter one crash, but haven't had any issues since then. There isn't a way to change the resolution yet in game, but the game worked great on my computer (I7 2600k, 16 gigs RAM, and a GTX 980).If your looking for an early access game that is already fun I highly recomend this one.https://youtu.be/B28UxfCqBuE	----->	21
48780783	The game is really fun but its exactly what you expect from an Alpha version: the game crashes, bugs everywhere, doesnt run smoothly even tho i have a high end pc, villagers act like complete autists. this game has so much potential but i already need a rest after 7 hours. i probably wont play this game again till it actually comes out. Edit: Better nowEDIT 2: Its really good now actually. things are explained nicely and everything has its reason to be there which i really appreciated as it made it clear how to fix problems in my city. aside from that its a beauty, seriously i love the artwork and details, the way you can customize buildings and run your own town it loved it now its a good 8/10	----->	19
48781897	If you like city builders ?simulation games you'll love Foundatiion, while there's not a whole lot of features you won't have seen before the implimentation and game mechanics make Foundation fresh even to old timersSimple to learn, harder to master... the game is engaging and most of all a whole lot of fun - and its not even finished yet	----->	10

48787542	Already one of the best games ever made.	----->	3
48787958	This game as a great Fondation , i hope they build on it !	----->	5
48788461	Game is great as is, will likely only get better. Top 3 things to know:-Its a lot like Banished, but more free-form-tutorial is minimal, may want to watch a video or two before starting but I understood it without one-very smooth gameplay, a lot of creative flexibility, may become my new favorite city-sim	----->	10
48788747	I dont get it, i dont have a fishers hut and cant increase the maximum capacity of my gold.	----->	1
48789377	Wow!  I have been wanting a good Medieval town-builder for a while!  I love Banished, big fan of Age of Empires, got heavy into Dawn of Discovery, adore the Stronghold games and the Total War series...  But none of those really hit the craving I've had lately.  Either there's too much combat or the elemental maintenance is too high and I just kinda wanna... play.... Medieval Cities: Skylines.This has a chill balance!  Definitely a game I can relax to, however it's challenging enough to where I don't feel as though I've exhausted all of my building options.This, Foundation, is what I've been craving!!!  Love it so much!!!Spoilers?  _______________________________________________Pros-You don't have to micromanage every person; they live their own lives, you simply govern.-The grid-free building system is fluid, aesthetically pleasing and keeps things interesting.(Even if I play the same map, choosing the same starting location, my town could turn out entirely different.)-There's a slight Settlers of Catan vibe when you start fresh; A new map is loaded and you have to select a property that suits you.  This comes down to which resources you value on your starting plot, do you want to be by water, etc.  A lot of strategy can go into where you place your town center.  Or not!  You can just go for it and see what happens!-Replayability.-Cute art style.-Great graphics, which run very smoothly on my PC.-For early access, I've played two 4-hour sessions and haven't felt any bugs.  So that's pretty impressive!-You can kind of make whatever you want by using monuments!  Screenshot fun-time! :DPersonal Preference-It would be cool if maps were randomly generated with/without select preferences: forest density, hills, mountains, water, etc. This would allow for further replayability but definitely isn't required!!!-Multiplayer would be fun.  My wife and I have been playing side by side and  comparing our little settlements, but it would be cool if we could have a trade route between one another or something!  However, if multiplayer never came to Foundation, that would be just fine!	----->	18
48791655	Very well-paced, methodical, intuitive city-building game. Early-Access caveats aside, I've had more fun with the systems in this game than most of the more recent triple AAA games I've played. The map-painting system really sells this game for me. I picked the game up for the first time in the afternoon. Before I knew it, it was 10 PM. I don't typically go in on city-builder games, but I'm hooked on this one. I think the devs really have a gem of a game here, and I'm excited to stick with it through Early Access into full release. Feels like we're in on the ground floor of something special and inspired.To the devs: Solid execution on your vision thus far. Keep it up!	----->	10
48792992	If you are into city builders, you will be into this game! :)Nice mixture of Settlers / Anno / Banished but still with an own feeling of gameplay.A must have imho. :)	----->	1
48794045	Short and simple review of Foundation in its current state of Early Access.Quite an interesting project, which is on track to become a revolutionary take on the city-builder genre with fluid and natural development. As of the 6th of February the game is still in a early state, and there doesn't seem to be too much replayability. This is however not a negative, as it is to be expected from Early Access titles. Gameplay however, is neat and extremely fluid. I have personally not had any crashes and it seems to provide quite stable FPS. The mechanics of building is nicely done, and so is the information tabs, although the UI can be distracting at times depending on your resolution. All in all, the content at the moment will keep you well occupied for a few hours. If you buy this game in the current state, do it to support the developers and show trust in the project, not to expect a fully developed game experience with unlimited content. Patience is key.	----->	8
48797186	i really enjoy it! a few things like lack of tutorial and minor bugs can be a bit difficult , im exited to see how far they push this game :)	----->	1
48797833	It's a pretty good game. Some minor bugs like crash on loading and weird in game error messages.The game could use a bit of a guideline or tutorial system (i.e. forester being to far away from the reforestation area).Leaving those few problems out, the game is great great great. It feels good, it looks good and for early access there is quiet something to do already. If this game gets physical threats (warfare) then it can easily become something very successful.	----->	5
48798049	Been following this game since it first popped up on the radar via a YT series. So much potential for this to become a real solid city builder especially with the added modding capabilities. Yes it's Early Access and yes it's a bit rough - I certainly was not expecting a polished game at this stage, but for me personally the 'snapshot' of gameplay that is being offered in this EA period by Polymorph is fun to play and is just enough to show the quality, ambition and exciting future this game has ahead of it. I certainly look forward to the changes, mods and new features that are on the way in the next year or so.	----->	10
48801314	Is it a good game? Yes.Is it a fun game? Yes.Did the devs put 30 euros of work into it? Yes.However, is the gameplay worth 30 euros? Arguably not.This game is like The Settlers 7, but without many of the constrictions that game offered. On the other hand, there isn't much to do after a couple of hours in. You just build a town and... That's about it.I'll recommend the game for the work the devs put in, because it's really pretty and well-made, but that's all I can say about it. Maybe if it was like 10 or 15 euros then I'd find the price more reasonable.	----->	16
48801845	Good game fun to build up your village, I would say when you start producing bread it is very unstable and villagers starve very easily. Few bugs to be fixed but I would still recommend this game.	----->	2
48807750	Well Impressed! I Agree  with the comparisons to the earlier Settlers games but not so much with civ's and skylines. The only gripe I have really is that the little buggers ( like in settlers II ) continuously annoy me by going out of their way to create paths where ever the hell they like and spoiling my perfectly symmetrical village! Curse my O.C.D!Keep up the great work.	----->	4
48809542	This is still very much an Early Access title. That said, I am already having a great time with it. The organic pathing and residency growth is a blast to watch. The aesthetic is great and the background music is great to play to.There are issues with some pathing into the custom, modular buildings but the issue log already has the Dev on it apparently. There are some crashes still, but the auto saves are frequent enough that I don't lose much at all when these happen and I have yet to run into anything that is a hard stop to gameplay.Overall: I think I will get my money out of this title while its still in EA and I am definately looking forward to its continued progress.	----->	9
48810367	I have to say this game brings in some of the good elements of other town / city builders, but adds plenty of new touches. The potential with it is massive with some of the ideas that seem to be there which are obviously still in progress.With some balancing of resources and changing perhaps how the movement of items is worked and markets it could be great, with the addition of future elements.As an example - it feels like food resource is scattered across the map and the market tender tends to have to go and fetch it. If they take all that is there then the next one goes without (not sure if they continue to search for more - but obviously takes more time) .. a simplification of this feature e.g. sharing the total pot wherever it's needed might work better. The other definite balancing is in regards to fish. I've had to build hundreds of fishers huts to support just 450 people. Maybe if they caught more each time it would work better.Note: there are also a couple of bugs around, however from reading through the discussions on Steam it is clear the devs are aware of them and an working on fixing them, so don't let those put you off.Despite all of the above, I've played for 30+ hours and will continue with my current town as well as potentially starting another. Once I get to a point I then have to look forward to the additional update and new features that are added.Superb game! :)	----->	10
48810663	Quite fun, though admittedly unfinished.	----->	0
48811071	Pirated this game and then I bought it because of how much I enjoy it as a city builder.  I am an avid player of Rimworld and Banished so this was right up my alley.  There are SIGNIFICANTLY less crashes after the last update as of Feb 5th 2019, the developers are very clear about it being in early access and seem to be supporting it with content regularly (from checking out the pre steam updates).	----->	6
48811419	The game is still in beta, but as of now I can see this game going far. It has different aspects to the story/gameplay. Gridless is a huge plus for me. Playing many simulation games that don't let you do what you want for your town can be annoying, but this allows for so much more creation. Love the concept! Keep going creators!	----->	2
48811462	Just bought the game and I can tell I'm going to play the shit out of it. Love the idea of a medieval city construction. The game has it's problems, but that is to be expected of a early access game. Keep up the good work with the game, absolutly love it!	----->	2
48811752	so far love this game alrdy have almost 15hrs in it it feels better than Banished cant wait to see what the moders have install for this one.	----->	5
48812550	Think medieval simcity meets settles and banished and you are on the right track.The creators have a goal that to many of us have been waiting for. A real builder with real freedom.Add some AI in form of your sla....subjects and its a hit.Dont usually like EA but so far there has been 4 updates in 5 days which is reassuring. Thank you Polymorph Games for giving us older dogs what WE want, and keep up the good work. If we can help we will.	----->	7
48814766	I must say, I am very glad that I bought this game.  There aren't a whole lot of things that I can complain about really, even for early access.  I have not experienced crashes personally.  I have however, encountered a bug when changing the UI size that caused me to have to hard close the game.  This issue happened once and has not repeated itself.  I have encountered an issue with a villager getting stuck in a house, I deleted the house and the problem seems to have fixed itself.That said, I'm enjoying the game very much!  I love that I can create the monuments myself.  It really does add a wonderful flavor to the game play, and somehow seems more satisfying when a monument finishes building!  I do think that there needs to be more content added, as I'm sure there will be.  So far, there has been a steady stream of hot fixes once or twice a day.  I will be honest that I wasn't very excited to build a monastary, but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw all the options and got it laid out.  I am really looking forward to seeing more content added to the game, and I'm happy that I got in early to support this project!	----->	15
48816149	One of the best 'hidden gems' on Steam.The grid-less building system and the node system which lets you snap additions/add-ons to your buildings is the best feature. The store page calls it organic and it really is. Every city you make will come out different and looking natural like a medieval city should.The way you manage zones by 'painting' them is another great feature along with how the townspeople 'cut' perfect roads themselves. It's so nice.It has very light mod support right now -not much to choose from but, I see that changing.Unless the Dev's do something crazy, this game is only going to get better than it already is. The intro price point could be a little lower but its still fair for what it offers right now.If you're tired of SimCity, Anno or even City Skylines keeping you on rails and telling you to always line everything up perfectly in an OCD grid fashion, buy this game and free yourself.And as always, it's Early Access so don't go nuts slamming the game for something it does not have yet.	----->	20
48816884	Cities Skylines meets Banished. Whats not to love? 10/10	----->	0
48820263	This is one of those little gems that's easily overlooked in a sea of city builders out there. Its bright stylised graphics may not appeal to everyone but it's beautifully done and pleasantly fitting for the organic style of the gameplay. What sets this medieval city sim apart is its attention to detail while maintaining a casual flow throughout the gameplay elements - you have control of things such as production and gathering buildings but your citizens decide on exactly where they will construct their house provided you zone for living quarters. you can plan out impressive monument structures like churches and manors but your citizens will create their own pathing to resources and merchants in a very organic manner. Ultimately you are in control of your city but the way it evolves  around your planning is both charming and satisfying.I haven't been able to spend much time on the game yet but already it has me hooked - the UI is unobtrusive and fairly intuitive once you've taken time to explore it, the pop-up windows offer plenty of at-a-glance information without burying you in a sea of text. If I could ask for just one alteration thus far it would probably be that the UI window for buildings which opens with a left click on said building would also close with a further left click on the same building - but I'm nitpicking... The inclusion of a system whereby you can gain 'standing' with kingdom, clergy and townsfolk in order to unlock extra progression adds some nuance to the gameplay and isn't over done so you never feel really held back, it's just another goal to attain like the mini quests along the way.TL:DRAll in all, Foundation is a fun little builder/management game that's easy to pick up, impossible to put down and has the depth to keep you fascinated for.. wait, what day is it again ? Well constructed game world, satisfying game play and just enough challenge to make it a very rewarding experience. If you've been waiting for gridless city building, this is it !	----->	24
48820887	Very good game with exciting future I think	----->	6
48821597	takes a while to get the hang of it. rewarding game for sure!	----->	2
48824063	I wanted a game like this for years and it provides the freedom I wanted to have in any other building sim. Usually 30 bucks is too much for me (early access, just found the game accidently etc) I tried it out and played 10 hours straight after purchaseThe complaints I read in other reviews (quest not suitable for location) are mostly due to players fault I guess. I planned my village well and everything went good. No villager got stuck and I did simply not accept quests for fish when I have no water source. Patience is key in this game and due to the beautiful landscapes and architecture it is a pleasure to just calmly watch over your citizens when they build a monastery which can take ages (well my monastery is huge af)enjoy to be the lord of the land ;)	----->	10
48826275	Lots of fun and plays really well for an early state. I'm always looking around for games with the right combination of building, management, attractiveness, and freedom, something you can sort of just chill out and play, and this one really scratches that itch. I think you can really see their plans to expand and grow the game from here, as well. I'm really looking forward to seeing how things progress.Mind, there are definitely some bugs, and some of the controls can be a little tricky to figure out at first, but that's to be expected in an alpha. The game pacing is pretty sedate, so it's definitely more of a game for those who want to chill out and play, not people looking for a fast paced challenge (I see that as a plus though, there are plenty of fast paced games out there).Things I think would be nice additions:Some animal life in the world (may already be in the plans, hunting lodge and all)Some light combat, like bandit raids after you've built your keep (not directly controlled, but a reason to have walls and soldiers on hand)Upgradeable production buildings (or maybe this will be taken care of by the villager task levels once that system is flushed out?)Ponds/lakes/some sort of water in all the area types (fishing!)Just want to say, well done on this one, it has a lot of promise and I'm looking forward to seeing where you take it :)	----->	15
48827431	Pro:Many community mapsLess than 5€ (at the moment)More control over the powerDifferent clubs (Putter, Driver, ...)Con:Inconsistant shots (like in reality)	----->	0
48829102	Veeeeeeeeeeeeeery nice	----->	3
48830684	I am a keen city builder games fan.Played several hundred hours of not thousand over the years since sim city 1, back in the early nineties.My other passion is medival games such as Crusader Kings.Right now this game is sort of banished without options.It is a few things,build an elaborate monument, it takes some time, but to delete it is done in seconds, no second toughts or partial tear down.Housing, is generated in an area you've set aside, but they do not pack well. SO there is always room for less houses than you think.Really very few quests etc.. for now. It feels kind of empty..I'd recommend it to diehards like me, but it needs some serious work to be really playable.My biggest drawback now is the five different areas you can choose from when starting a game.1. They are always identically the same.2. At least one lack water, no water no fishing. No fish makes it hard to keep city solvent.	----->	1
48831379	Only played a little bit so far, but even though I didn't know what i was doing half the time, I loved every minute of it. Great game for early access. There are something i would change and suggest, but that is to be expected of all games. 100% recommend this game for city building and medieval lovers.	----->	5
48832131	Yep	----->	0
48834061	It's a  Banished with a more Settlers  Next Generation feel. Keeps you quite busy for a while and is a neat little city builder. Running rather smoothly, considering it's still in early access, with the occassional crash every now and then, but those haven't set me back much as of yet. Still a lot of features i'd wish for missing, such as changing weathers, more buildings, actual repercussions for wrong decisions (i think i have lost a grand total of ONE citizen), sending off soldiers quest is yielding wayyyyyyyy too much money for no risk at all so far.  Also the interface is far from perfect- I am having some trouble really determining, wether or not i am losing on a ressource, so i end up just building more and more of the production line and in the end overproduce heavily	----->	-11
48835755	A solid entry for early access that sells the premise of the game but still needs some polish and probably some more systems. I got a good 16-20 hours out of it and I've nearly completed my first run through. The game hits a good balance of micro-management to resource planning. AI is a common problem in these games but not so for Foundation; one of the most satisfying features is the organic pathways created based on how regularly Citizens path-find over them. (Although I'd love more path texture options or the ability to paint pathways.) Additionally, the way citizens build and plan their own houses takes an often tedious element from games like Timber and Stone and just automates it. You still the satisfaction of being able to build your own churches, forts and manor houses so the 1:1 building isn't lost entirely. And the building process (while sometimes a bit restrictive) is very intuitive and open to modding and expansion.All in all, there's still a few placeholder systems and values and the late game could probably use a balance pass sooner rather than later (costs get a bit easy to meet) but I enjoyed the core game and will probably do a few runs before retiring the game for a few patches. I look forward to further development and will keep coming back for more.	----->	11
48838293	It took me some time to figure out a few things, but once you understand what you are actually supposed to do it's a lot easier and incredibly fun to play. I also haven't experienced any bugs so far.This is honestly a lovely game.	----->	7
48839967	While I do think the game is very interesting and I can see why it would be popular, personally it's just way too stressful and gives me way too much anxiety to do anything as spy, and because of how the game works at least in my experience it's almost impossible to anything at all besides moving without immediately getting shot. I am unable to see any way to gain experience or skill at the game to actually start getting wins as a spy, but even then regardless I can't even play the game for 10 minutes without feeling like I'm about to have a heart attack, and I'm the kind of person who never has that issue with games, so why this game in particular has that effect, especially so soon, I just can't understand. And when playing as sniper, I find it incredibly easy because I always end up just watching a spy at the edge of the scope with the laser pointed somewhere else and they will do basically anything thinking that I'm simply not looking. It feels like by far the most unbalanced thing I have ever seen, and playing only as sniper gets boring extremely quickly, and feels like I'm locking myself out of half of the entire game. I might be going about the whole thing entirely wrong, I don't know. But I personally just can't find even a slight amount of enjoyment out of this game.	----->	13
48840706	yeah it's pretty good I played 6.3 hours got up to 120 peeps? started building a church with capacity for all of them (GOD FORBID WE HAVE HEATHENS!) and it crashed when i clicked on a mission my whole experience was really good up until that point so good that i'm writing this review than going back to the game  if you like city builders then you'll definately like this or if you like factory building games i could see you liking this aswell only issue I ran into was the camera can be a bit wonky if you want to zoom out really far and its really easy to exploit the standing for the labor faction with market decorations which I absolutely did but its probably a good thing cause it encourages you to spruce up the streets with signs just wish I could get some arrow signs towards the market or the vendors fun game worth the price even now plus the animations are CUTE AS HEKK	----->	29
48840862	When this game is finished it'll be one of the absolute best city builders on the market, but right now it's too buggy to warrant the $30 asking price. Creative freedom is near limitless and I find the graphics to be incredibly charming but building something over the course of a couple hours only for it to bug out path finding which then cripples your economy isn't fun. When it works, however, it is immensely enjoyable.	----->	8
48843083	This game shows a lot of potential. There are for sure some bugs but I havent found anything game breaking yet and bugs are to be expected with an alpha. I would say wait a bit on this until the game has some more updates but so far looks good.	----->	0

48851886	10+ hours into this game I can tell that it has potential. My first reaction to this game is that it feels like Banished plus Northgard. Definitely not as difficult as Banished (for now) since there isn't any hard core environmental condition. Early access doesn't really get you too far into the game because of unclear trading system and limited food sources. Plus people are pretty much unhappy at all time. Overall very enjoyable and excited to see farther updates. 8/10	----->	0

48864489	Early access reviews can be a little too critical. I have roughly 7 hours into this game and I have to say that I really enjoy it. It can easily drag you in for hours on end. Zooming in on the little toons while they are working is quite funny. I haven’t ran into any gameplay issues yet and it’s been an overall enjoyable experience. A couple things I would like to note; Sometimes the decorations end up floating if you’re trying to place them on a hill. I also feel like I have to constantly have my warehouse tabs open and looking at them much too frequently to make sure my exports/imports are going in and out.	----->	5

48872219	Hi, hi! Quick word!(BEFORE READING, THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME! IT'S NOT FINISHED, SO KEEP THAT IN MIND!)Foundation is a decent city-builder with a chilled environment! I would most definitely suggest to people that would like a nice, calm management game. Love it!Foundation has started out as an amazing game, but a few things should be ironed out.1: Pathfinding is good, but it could use some work. Villagers usually take the long way around for some reason.2: AI: When building is occurring, the AI tend to rely on other AI to finish the job, even on the small tasks.3: More features! Yeah, this is in Early Access so these things will likely be worked on.	----->	8
48874932	I was hesitant to get this game as it is an Early Access title, but after reading reviews here and online decided to go for it.  About 13 hours in and no regrets so far.  It is clearly a game that is still in development (UI needs some work, placeholders in the game for features that aren’t active yet, etc.), but enough of it is up and working to be enjoyable and the devs are clearly actively working on the game.  In the week I’ve owned the game, they have pushed out updates with bug fixes every 1-2 days).  For a game still in alpha, I’ve encountered surprisingly few bugs and none that are game-breaking.This game does require you to figure out how to play more or less on your own, which personally I have enjoyed though others have complained about so if that’s a drawback for you, avoid this game.  Having said that, the community forums are pretty active so if you have a question it probably has already been asked and answered on the forums and if it hasn’t you can expect a timely answer.Overall, I’m enjoying the game and even with just the currently implemented features can expect to get another 40+ hours of enjoyment out of it.  That number will go up as they continue to release new features.  For me, it has proven to be a fun game definitely worth the less than 30 USD price tag.	----->	5
48875358	For it to be in early access, it's a nice game. I had some minor issues trying to balance food to feed everyone, or clothes. And at the same time be able to keep up with all the other demands. For the next session, im gonna turn off auto development for settlements.Only helpfull advice I can give here is to use the help button if you get stuck in the beginning!If you're a fan of city-building sim. and relaxing athmosphere, this is a nice addition to your collection. If you like polished city-building sims, wait for early access to finish.	----->	11
48876768	Promising start, friendlier Banished. Could be excellent after more updates.	----->	3
48877735	I purchased the game because I love medieval city building games like Banished and this seemed perfect.What I love about the game:- The way your town shapes is almost organic. The AI townspeople will build their homes and make roads where it makes sense to them, and this beautiful casual randomness really makes the town feel MEDIEVAL, and not the communist 200% efficiency perfect grid playing that other games in this genre are encouraging by giving the player full control on design.- Building the town feels like a story, you gain influence with the different factions by completing quests and building monuments,which allows you to unlock unique buildings. Your little shithole village barn church might still become Notre Dame!- Very beautiful European style art, you can build castles and churches on hills and mountains making your little germanic village fantasy come true.- You can fully design the monuments, architecture potential is endless- Speaking of quests, I very like the idea of random quests system similar to games like CKII and EU4The game is not very impressive right now it terms of amount of quests and building, but the game is still in relatively early stage and I see lots of potential in it.	----->	28
48878331	Greatest sim-builder since SIMCITY back when it was innovative [first title or SC2000]. Ive launched and just lost few hours. Will come back very often.  1000/10	----->	0
48879250	First impressions are, it's Banished meets The Settlers.  Both of which I've enjoyed playing.Yes it's early access and there are things that need tweaking or adding to. It's feels fairly easy to pick up so far. Which is a good thing, as there isn't a tutorial at the moment. The only major issue so far, was trying to work out how to unlock the manor house. I had to look up on the forums here, to find the answer.  So a tutorial or introductory scenario, would be a big plus.I'm Eight hours into the game now and have to say it feels value for money and has great potential for the future.	----->	8
48879790	Here's my VERY basic review. Fun game to play around in and relax with. A tutorial would be great and the only issue I've had is not understanding why the villagers wont eat sometimes and they starve, usually after the Church is built and the Village grows, but other than that I have really enjoyed the game play and love the art style and sounds of it. Look forward to see what the Devs bring in the future to it.	----->	6
48880615	EDIT: So since I reviewed this game, I have played many more hours of it, and the game has been updated many times.  I therefore want to update my review!*The issue with the Lord's Manor and gold stocks has been resolved.  The game now has built-in early-game quests that lead you in a very natural progression to learn the game and set up your early economy.  The Lord's Manor is now one of the easiest buildings to unlock, and so the loss of gold is not an issue.  Also, there are a wide variety of quests and special events with varied benefits and negatives.*There are now a number of helpful tools in the UI for managing villagers, which mostly eliminates the need for directly selecting them.  Villagers also will shift between houses on their own to optimize distance from their workplace/market/well/church, eliminating the issue where they would just build a house wherever there was room, and then be perpetually angry because it would take them all day to walk to work and back.*Because of the way the game has evolved, having to click the X to close building menus is more of a benefit than a problem now.  It's often helpful to have multiple buildings open at once.*Trade feels a little more natural now, including trade boons for completing quests helping that faction.  Still kind of wish for resources to be a bit more map-specific, but the game is so beautiful and streamlined and fun, I feel guilty even saying it.  Leaving my original post and first Edit up so you can see the progression as the game has evolved.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall, this game is one of the most fun and addictive I've played in recent years.  I had been craving a game with free-form building, and I took the chance on this one...and I was not disappointed!  If you enjoy free-form building (like the settlement-building in Fallout 4) you will not be disappointed.  If you're looking for a Medieval combat simulation with building as a central mechanic, this is not the game for you.  The most combat you get in this game is sending soldiers off to help defend the kingdom in exchange for money and land.The game is still in development, so there are still some clunky elements--your villagers start to get stuck on building elements and each other once things get crowded, there are still some place-holder text lines, and that sort of thing.  But the game is beautiful, the monuments with their sticky elements are very user-friendly, and once you get the hang of the interface, the game is very easy to learn.Now some details.Things I love:The overall concept is incredible.  There is something immensely satisfying about the way the villagers build their own housing.  The combination of free-form building and painted districting overlays is brilliant.  The villager animations are adorable.  Designing the monuments--especially later in the game when you have lots of component options--is very fun.  The difference between monuments and public buildings, which are unlocked by beautifying your city/gaining influence with a power faction and upgrading your villagers respectively, is a clever game mechanic.  The basic concepts of the game are similar to games like Age of Empires, where you build resource collecting buildings and assign villagers to that resource, which is very intuitive.  It's just a relaxing, immensely satisfying game.Things I wish were different:*You are limited to 500 gold at the beginning of the game, and it is only by unlocking the Lord's Manor that you gain the ability to raise your maximum capacity--a relatively difficult monument to unlock.  Meanwhile, the Wooden Keep is an early-unlock monument that opens up combat quests which give a 1000 gold reward.  The extra gold is lost, which in a game where your gold reserves fluctuate wildly, can be quite frustrating.  I wish there were either no limit, or a 1000 gold limit to start.*Selecting villagers is very difficult as they are always moving, and you can't click-drag a select box to catch one or more.  This is alleviated somewhat by being able to assign idle villagers to buildings directly at the building, but there is still no way to assign Builders without clicking a villager directly.  I wish there were a population management screen where you could make villager assignments and track your population's needs and happiness.*Selecting buildings opens up a very helpful window, but the only way to close it is by clicking an X.  I wish you could close the window by either right-clicking or by selecting the building again.*The trade mechanic is relatively simple to learn, but it is currently highly tiered and immutable.  Trading refined resources is part of the economy built into the game, but I wish the resources you were able to trade was either randomized or variable, so that playing the game didn't feel like a trial and error experiment in learning which buildings to build in which order, but one in which you had to react to the resources you have available.*I enjoy the quests, but there are only a few that keep popping up; many of which aren't possible to complete.  I look forward to more being available.All in all, it's already a good game, if you're looking for what it has to offer.  I was, and it was the best game purchase I've made in ages!  But it's definitely obvious that it's a work in progress.  I can't wait to see what the end product will be!Update:I have now played the game for some 14 hours.  I take back some of my wishes--unlocking the Lord's Manor is not so hard as I had thought, once you learn the game, and having large quantities of gold is not nearly so useful as having large quantities of trade goods to sell to your villagers or other towns.  After spending more time with the game, I think making the trade mechanic more complex would make the game nearly impossible to play--you need to be able to sell certain goods and buy others in order to make the town viable.I do think it's a worthwhile thought that perhaps the kinds of goods you can produce should depend on the terrain type chosen at the outset.  Like maybe wine and sheep for mountainous regions, grain and honey for the river, fish and dyes for the coast, etc.  And then the trade cities (and goods available/desired for trade) should be different depending on the terrain.  It felt weird growing grain essentially on a beach, and that I was well into the mid-game before I was able to build a fisherman's hut.  BUT, these are minor complaints/suggestions.  Still a freaking amazing game, the more I play it the more I love it.  It truly fills me with joy every time I open it up.	----->	43
48881396	I've been looking for a game exactly like this for a while; although you can tell it is unfinished and in early access, once you figure out how to play (the game lacks a good way of teaching you how to play) the game is very pleasant, a very calming experience, and generally very good.9/10 would buy again	----->	7
48881826	Foundation: This is a great city building game! It has a few bugs which is to be expected being in early access. A few crashes.. overall a great game! RECOMMENDED!!!	----->	6
48882761	I really enjoyed the first couples of hours spent on the game so far. The organic development of the city is fantastic, it is a really nice change compared to many common mediaval city builder.The content is quite limited at this stage but I am looking forward to the next steps! Totally recommend.	----->	2
48886802	yes	----->	1
48886895	Played this game for a few hours since I am a big fan of city management games in the medieval genre.  For an EA title I'm impressed.  The UI is slightly intuitive if you have played other similar games and I caught on quickly.  Graphics are smooth, the world is great looking.  The tutorial needs work, new players to this genre will be relatively lost but will be able to pick up on it quick.  The residential building is good however sometimes you end up with odd structure placement.  I'm sure this will turn into a great city management game once all the features are added and it is a full release!  Overall this is what I thought Banished should be.  Foundation is waaaaaaay better and I can't wait to see what this game adds in the future.	----->	10
48887205	Good fun with friends. Loads of custom maps. 9/10 would play again.	----->	4
48888081	Love the game, it is fun and relaxing to play. Cant wait to play more.	----->	4
48889442	This is a good game! It needs some ironing out but overall a good game.	----->	6
48891353	Absolutely fantastic base for a game with huge potential.It's City: Skylines meets Banished.Right now scope is kind of limited, AI is a bit wonky, and large town sizes are difficult to manage. However the developer has addressed all these things and knows why and is working on fixing them and implementing new features.Very happy to support development of a game like this.	----->	13
48891730	So far it's a nice game but it is too simple. There is not much to do. There aren't any campaigns or missions to keep you interested and feeling like you're working towards some goal. There are short quests during game play but they're the same every time.  I've built two villages so far and I'm getting bored which is sad cause I hoped that this game would provide entertainment for long hours. There are also bugs which was to be expected.Things that need improvement in my opinion:[spoiler]1) Add campaigns or scenarios to make the game interesting.2) Fix the source code visibility everywhere.3) Add more buildings and things to do.4) Add more maps. 5) Fix villagers walking through building walls instead of using the door.6) Make the residential desirability zone bigger.[/spoiler]I still recommend this game because it's really pretty and fun and it could be amazing when developed fully with more features and fixed bugs. I do think that almost $30 is too much for this game in its current state.	----->	17
48892923	Game has a lot of potential. It's basically functioning and requires some imagination to find a point to it. Hopefully as the development progresses, it fleshes out all the things that would make it an engaging experience.	----->	0
48893752	Just great! If you love city building games and you were put off by the fact that all the pretty things you did to make them look nice didn't benefit your game, then this is the game for you! It's early yet and needs balance, but decorating your town is mandatory. It's really peaceful to build, the graphics are smooth and everything pop's nicely when you click it or attach it.	----->	11
48894542	well after sinking a good 8 hours into this game i can say it is very addictive, however a few things to note.1: its not very clear how to obtain more splender, tho influince is easy to come by2: villagers seem to bail very quickly as you progress, and without splender unlocking new buildings becomes frustraiting3: would be nice to see more trade ability4: would be nice to see more options for members in office and perks accociated with it.5: at some point it would be nice to add a friends list ability for trade and aid for supplies and solders for missions.the $33 price tag for an alpha build seems alittle high how ever aslong as any major updates or dlc becomes availible at a discount or free to the alpha backers, it should make for an amazing expirience other then that and a few name and txt bugs i look forward to more added content.	----->	21
48895614	got to 170 population... bastards are too hungry and need to much Jesus needs work.....	----->	-5
48895967	It has LOTS of bugs and glitches but in spite of all that i can see this game becoming something beautifull that everyone can enjoy.	----->	0
48896258	it's a nice grind game you can play while in ready check for the next match of your main game, this is certainly a fast game in wich each round lasts about 3-8 minutes or at least how long you survive before blowing up. Sure this game needs a real Balance system, where weapons should be grouped in categories of normal to rare, in one lobby and epic to legendary in another lobby so the Power Score is measured with the mounted Weapons instead of total Power Score and only a difference of 200 PS for matches, Let highlevel player fight each other and the lowbies with them self, since it's not fun playing this game with all rare against someone with epic to legendary weapons/wheels/thrusters. So yeah a nice game but not very balanced.	----->	6
48897816	Addictive city builder! Very pretty graphics as well.	----->	1
48905518	this is fun with friends	----->	4
48906014	Would not recommend yet, but putting a Yes as it's promising :)	----->	2
48906081	Good game. Not a whole lot of content but enough to get a good amount of hours in.  I know for sure more content will make the game more complex and i cannot wait for it!	----->	3
48910087	I really do like this game. It's a game where you have to plan ahead. Yes, there are some issues with the game but it is still in alpha so not perfect. One of the things I would change straight away is a tutorial. After 42hrs of playing I have just found out what to do when the envoy shows up and I have a stack of leather that I have no idea what to do with. Simple things like food production could do with being raised but overall I think it's one of the best games I have played since Banished and Forest Village. Keep up the good work Devs and I look forward to seeing how the game progesses.	----->	10
48911320	how the hell do you rotate buildings!?	----->	-4
48918201	the game is charming. the music is relaxing, the village nice to look at, the developement and expansion is pretty smooth and intuitive. at the moment their is quite a few things to do, enough for a few hours of gaming. their is some replayability from the different maps and places to choose expanding from. i am enjoying the game at this moment :) i am eager to see farther developement in the next updates to come :)	----->	8
48918969	I would never play this game by myself, but my friend really likes making maps on it, and all of my buddies come play on them, and it's really fun. If that's the case for you, chances are you'll have a good time.	----->	7
48919375	This game is thrilling and a great way to spend time with my boyfriend.	----->	3
48924879	Love it so far! Their is about 6-8 hours of content here so far, but your town can grow endlessly. Great casual city builder game.	----->	0

48934675	Nice game just needs more content, and plz let me zoom more out camera is so awkward	----->	-2
48935583	Enjoy this game a lot and participate in the Discord server. Dev is quite active.Would really only recommend buying it in Early Access if you're hardcore into city builders.Wait a little while otherwise.Great game thus far.	----->	2
48936001	Played through pretty much all the content it has right now and its really good and has TONS of potential for the future. I found time just flying by, as i was managing and watching my little town grow. :D At the point of writing this the game is missing parts and things arent done yet and the UI needs some work and stuff, but that is how this works. Looking foreward to seeing what the future holds for this game. :)	----->	2

48948061	one of the best city builders ive played to date	----->	3
48949137	This is a game that will only get better, as you can tell the developer has passion for what they are doing. Easily worth the $30 cost.	----->	2
48951098	It definitely has potential, but for the meantime try getting it when it's for sale or whenever it has more content.	----->	0
48952908	i just played golf. it was like playing golf, but not.	----->	2
48953072	Me and my brother have some real fun playing this lol good time killer.	----->	10
48957685	The game is already good as it is, but has so much potential. I hope the devs exploit that potential.	----->	3
48965014	Really fun game. Easy to play, hard to master. Not P2W at all, very new player friendly with easy access to cards. It's free and the devs to a great job with updates and new cards.	----->	10
48970611	Great potential. Upgraded Banished. Horrendously optimized or they mining through your chips. Dunno, cant recommend for everyone since u need unadequately strong machine for such a cartoonish gaem, not yet.edit: after a year, game went gallopingly! great work, devs. A textbook example of early acces well made, for others.	----->	7
48972109	I do like the game. It is somewhat a bit of fresh air to the genre. But its still quite early...After a bit of gameplay the NPC's start to get stuck like idiots on their houses (that the game automaticly places), because they are too close to each other. Guess that could do with some working...Other than that the content is quite limited, doesn't take that many hours to unlock everything, and getting only 2 new npcs at each time (atleast thats why i ever get) its kind of really annoying... Guess the game wants to force you to progress at a certain spead... Overall, i would say its still not worth 30€, but i've spent a lot more in far worse, and this one does have potential to get there if the developers fix the kinks and add a bit more content to it.	----->	10
48972334	Foundation is a city-builder that stands out very well. It's quite intuitive, which is good since it doesn't offer any tutorials in game (yet). Despite being in Alpha, it's a gorgeous game and is still long enough to have fun with. As of about 6 hours in I have technically unlocked almost all of the buildings available right now, so be wary of that.Overall I'd definitely suggest picking up the game. The price is a bit steep at 30 dollars, but it's also supporting a new game and developer that seems to really enjoy what they're doing.	----->	10
48973266	Great game.The great:  I feel like the bones of the game are really solid, and what will be added is going to make this game very satisfying.  If you like city building and watching macro planning take bloom, Foundation takes a little bit of everything and balances it really well. Areas to improve:  Early game is long.  Waiting for villagers.... if you mess up the balance of your workers you will be waiting for about an hour.  I've learned not to rely on trade for buying (selling seems to work fine).  Make sure you don't go to zero 'Tools' until you have built the means to produce them yourself. I'm still getting into the end game, but have really enjoyed the point past the first hour.	----->	2
48974990	Great game!!Reminds me of the old Cossacks games from yesteryear! It does have a couple of bugs which still need ironing out as expected with early access but has lots of contents and I expect lots more in the future. Had daily updates last week (first week in release) with bug fixes. I'm looking forward to the full finished version.	----->	0
48976907	UPDATE:as of february 2020, the game as really developed into something great. The dev's are always listening to user input and pumping out updates and patches all the time. This last big Winter Update has improved the game by leagues. -----Great game and only getting better. Devs are frequently patching and improving the game. The discord community is very active. Lots of mods being fleshed.I recommend this game in the current state but there is one bug that really bothers me. The farmers bug out on high-pop games(500+) and this limits creativity and map choice. Devs are aware of it.	----->	2
48976971	I've had alot of fun playing this game,but my economy always seems to go bust the second I build my first church. If anyone has any good tutorials for beginners please link them below. I'm not sure if games broken or I'm incompetent. Thank You	----->	7
48977364	A quite nice Medieval city builder with cartoonish graphics. The game is not yet completely finished, but the devs are already quite far. It could become a very nice game after work. At the current state 13-02-2019 it is sometimes buggy and can crash ( once every 5 hours for me on average.) But the game autosaves, so you don't really lose progress.The game feels like a mixture between simcity and banished. With an high degree of building customization. I hope it will be possible soon to use the soldiers (which your citizens can become). Even though its still not finished I still was able to sit back after work and relax, watching a small much shack become a sprawling medieval town..	----->	8
48979028	Great art direction, good game flow.This is a great game, very immersive. I am looking forward to more content as I smacked up against the end of content after about 24 hours. This is a game I will be coming back to often.	----->	6
48980071	Dear Fellow Steamers, I play the strategy games of this world folks so my opinion is worth mucho dinero.  This is a fun micro/macro management game and at this stage in its development will give you a decent number of hours of playtime.  I would suggest it strongly if you have enjoyed other town building games (think banished and forest village, although it is a more simple minded game then those titles).  No real issues with it as a product, and very excited to see where the creators take it.Thanks for your time!Mr. Bystander	----->	9
48996512	I do enjoy the game & look forward to it expanding. The main troubles that I have run into is 1. I lost all of my saved games when I had expanded over 6 hexes, most frustrating. 2. During anther try the village's all build so close to each other that they could not get into their homes needles to say I had to start over again. 3 I hate it when they say that they have no were to build when their is land available. Other that that when it is working it is fun to play, Love the simple graphics. it could use the farmers living in their farm instead of having another house on top of the farm.	----->	1
48996881	It has solid potential. I am fairly impressed with the entire design and how much though has been placed into the development. This is an easy going city builder that evolves as you play, becoming progressively more challenging with population increases and adding more building options as you progress into the next city level. I highly recommend it as a city builder.	----->	10
48997440	DO NOT SPEND $30 ON THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANT TO SUPPORT THE DEVS VISION OF THIS GAME.There is not $30 worth of content in this game. That being said, I have sat down and played multiple 4+ hour sessions of this game already and I only bought it a few days ago. This game can best be described as a peaceful medieval city building sim. The graphics are pretty, the progression makes sense (for the most part), it's relatively bug free for an Alpha. I was able to get completely lost in my little village. There's a little bit of mod support already and I found I was able to enjoy this game a lot when I used a mod that basically gave me a creative mode. It's still fun without that but I was able to see my village to it's ideal vision with it. The art style definitely leans more toward the cute side but that's fine by me. I actually really ended up getting quite immersed by the background noise and music when I put headphones on. There are some issues with the game as it stands today. Pathing can be troublesome. Sometimes villagers will take the oddest path to a newly placed workplace, which creates the path that everyone will continue to use in the future. A feature to delete paths would be nice to clean up villages and make pawns path better. It would also help later on if you want to move houses around in your village center as villagers will not build houses on top of paths and this can cause them to say there is no land open when there is. The UI is DEFINITELY still in an early and basic state and will require a lot more work. Some mechanics aren't very well explained (there is currently no real tutorial, just a mission tree that kind of guides you through the basics). It seems like the devs are paying attention to known issues though and I am eager to see how this game progresses in the future. I was actually lead to this game by watching ManyATrueNerd on youtube.I would recommend this game but ONLY if you really like these types of games and are willing to spend this much money for potential future content. I will reiterate, there is NOT $30 of content in this game.	----->	38
49003836	The little time i had with this game was amazing, there are a few bugs here and there i saw but it just released into early access so that's fine, i wanted a game like this for ages and this game delivered exactly what i wanted, me being able to build without having to snap to the grid, there's freedom in this game like no other and its so... damn... good...	----->	5
49011244	I'm recommending this game, but with the recommendation that you play it after it's had some time to be developed more.  It's a fantastic 'Banished-esq' medieval city builder but after only 8 hours in the game, I feel like I've seen all there is to see and done all there is to do.  Unlike Banished, I don't really feel a need to go back and play it a lot more to improve production or efficiencies.  I had a lot of fun with it, but it definitely lacks a bit of polish and could use some more content.  It looks like they might implement some kind of combat in the future but it isn't here as of the time of this review.	----->	15
49011533	Creative city building game, pretty good graphics for Early Access. The HUD/GUI needs some work. Some little bugs here and there. Tutorial would be nice for beginners. Maybe enemies to fight?. Also the game needs more polishing.7/10	----->	5
49011832	Great game so far, really enjoying it. I cant wait to see where this goes. if you enjoy city building games you should have a blast with this one, Even though this game is not yet complete you should still have a fun time. Placing buildings in congested areas is stress free and easy as hell. certain buildings can be custom built and that is a real pleasure. great game so far cant wait to see where it goes.	----->	14

49014104	good game, still lot of things to work and iron out, but so far is a good, with plenty to do if you like these kind of games. thumbs up for the organic growth mechanich for the town, has a lot of potential!	----->	9

49017553	Great Game, I am having a great time with its current state and cannot wait to see what else will be added. Game is unique in city building. The menu system needs work to be more user friendly.	----->	3
49019561	The game is the closest game I've found that satisfies my very specific city-builder itch. However, If you are not someone who enjoys getting in on a game at the ground floor, [b]Do Not[/b] get this game. It is very much an early access, and contains a bunch of bugs and incomplete features. It is not fully optimized and is lacking in content. Furthermore, I probably should not have bought the game at full price. But, if you can make it passed all that, then you will probably have fun. I certainly am (and my grades are reflecting it). I'd say come back in a year and check to see how development has gone. ~7.5/10edit: grammar	----->	2
49020553	Even though this game just came out 15 days ago as of when i'm typing this, i see this game having potential. i only have about 2 hours in this game so far but am going to gain more. through my game play ive found that the AI has there own decisions in where they decide to live and where paths are. The game is still vary early access and i personally dont think its worth $30, if i was to chose how much this game cost id make it 10-15 maybe less. if you are looking to buy this game id definitely wait for the game to be updated again, but if you want to test this game and help in the development them go ahead and buy it, its still fun even though you have to understand how it works, it definitely helps to have played a game like banished. anyways hope this helps you, have a good day humans and aliens :}	----->	22
49020728	i love this game so much and iv only just started playing it thank you. the graphics are adorable, it gets blurry when you zoom in on the edges which is kinda wierd but cool at the same time. like im an egale and flying above them and zooming in on them with my egal vision. im very excited to keep playing thank you its really fun.	----->	11

49026350	Hello. I personally wasn't to happy to read all the negative comments. People are missing the fact that this game is not final yet. The tutorial is indeed not there, but if you use your brain a bit, you can learn quite easily. I still don't know what some functions do (only played 8 hours so far), but I feel that I will learn soon.If you are the type of person that wants to discover how to play a game without a tutorial, someone keen to learn, then this game is for you.If you want to have everything handed over to you, then this is not the game for you.I personally recommend it highly.Edit:a year later I started playing again and it's muuuuuuuuuch better and easier to play. A lot of updates with good content so far and 2021 will only be better for this game. Good to see it on the right track!	----->	10
49029631	One of the strongest early access games I have played and well worth the price tag.  Has been extremely stable with only minor hiccups.   Game play is enjoyable and Foundation is a fun, chill game to play.   Might be a bit too easy to earn gold and balance could be tweaked a bit, but overall a solid start to the game and I am looking forward to what is too come!	----->	9
49036319	This game is great. The potential with this game is endless. I've bought it yesterday and I have been playing it non-stop. I'm addicted to it to say the least. If the developers keep working on this game I believe it will end up something like we've never seen before. This is my first review for anything I think and I think this game rightfully deserves it. Yeah there are some bugs and some kinks that need to be worked out but then again it's still in Alpha. Overall, I severely recommend you at least give this game a shot if you're into games of this genre or you want to try something new.	----->	5
49037930	This game is in alpha, so keep in mind that it crashes a lot and it's not fully fleshed-out - but it's got great bones.I love the organic, free-form, gridless building style. The graphics are beautiful. The monument system took me a minute to figure out, but it's awesome to be able to give the buildings my own look using add-ons and decorations. And I love that there's no combat, 'cause I'm not looking for that kind of stress. I just want to be able to relax and watch my town grow.There's a bit of a challenge in planning out and setting up the town so that everything functions smoothly, but I enjoy that sort of challenge. And if I mess up, I'm not bothered about starting over.This game really pleases me in ways that Banished and the Anno series didn't. It's rough around the edges right now but I look forward to seeing what they come up with to fill it out.	----->	12
49040432	Many little bugs still exist, but nothing that cant be fixed before a full game release. One of my favorite games of this past year.	----->	2
49041705	This is a great little game. As an old fart I found the only problem I have is getting the lazy little buggers to raise there houses. But, that's probably me, My villages tend to be long spread out villages with churches everywhere, and, being a Druid I find that hilarious.If you like Banished then this game is for you. It is still in development so it is possible it may even be better down the road.	----->	4

49067682	Game is very fun.    Cant wait to see more buildings.    +++ Amazing EA game +++	----->	0
49069914	To Whom It May Concern,I am very pleased with the game. I am reporting two glitches that I have identified thus far. 1. When building walls, at times the wall will extend through the entire length of the map.2. I am building my second wooden keep and it glitches and will not build. The builders continue to change with varying supplies. Great game...	----->	4
49075310	So far I recommend this game but I was wondering if anyone could help me on a little graphics issue. I have a 950M and its not that old of a card, I mean I could use an upgrade but why am I getting 8 FPS at normal settings? Is this game that graphic dependent? Or do I have something wrong with it? If anyone might have had the same issue please let me know, thanks!	----->	3
49075955	This might be a great game some day, but thats a couple of years in the future. Right now sheep moonwalk around without moving their feet. There UI is straight outta 1982. The tooltips tell you very little, considering how much you have to figgure out on your own. Like wtf does commoner mean in this game? Translations are done by the community, so lets hope the community grows! Don't buy this game yet! Wait a couple of months/years, then reconsider.	----->	2

(they should have limited)* Berry, Grape Farms.* Beer Production -> Brewery / Tavern for Happines.* Stone Roads > Dirt Roads > Walkways. Tier depending walking speed.* Vertical bar at villager list looks like inverted.* Detailed Tutorial!!!* on / off switches on buildings.* If Keep Cores can be merged might be made better looking keeps.* Floor flattenig needs for cliffside buildings.* for too many settler name problem, perhaps Jr. Or 2nd like suffixes might be solution.* if a building destroyed their employes should be unemployed automaticly.* Keyboard Shortcuts for building / territory / trade / Zones* Able to remove market stalls 1 by 1* Budget window is complicated need more labels to understand.* Price is a bit high but its ok. its in EA..	----->	12
49126261	Very good city builder with a lot of potential. I'm really interested to see where the devs take this game. The price is definitely steep for the amount of content currently available, so it would be wise to buy Foundation on sale. Either way I highly recommend this game if you are a city-builder enthusiast.	----->	7

49152511	Having played the game for a while now, I can change the review to positive.  Previous issues with lag, low frame rate etc have vanished.  The game is beautiful and very interesting.I look forward to the continued updates.	----->	3
49153337	This is a reluctant thumbs up from me because the game is very basic yet massively overpriced. Just look at the full-price of these examples of titles with similar game-play mechanics:Dots Extreme - £1.59Hexcells - £1.99Hexcells Plus - £1.99Lyne - £1.99Blockwick 2 - £2.09Quell - £2.89Quell Momento - £2.89Quell Reflect - £2.89Burnstar - £3.99Hexcells Infinite - £3.99Parcel - £3.99*Slayaway Camp (£6.19) and Desktop Dungeons (£11.99) are two other quite expensive examples. The point is, £7.19 is asking a lot for this game.  The game has solid controls and pleasant sound-effects but these features are not exactly hard to implement in a game of this nature. The art-style is of a good standard and the gameplay mechanics are enjoyable and well-varied. The best feature, for me, is the easy-on-the-ear soundtrack - very good![u]And now the not so good:[/u]1. The default option has you play in a small box that's HALF the size of the screen. Why? Although you can play in a window, I could not get it to display so that it covered the full-screen as per the advertised screenshots (...you know...like almost every other game).2. It's quite unbalanced. There were times I pondered hard over the first four or five levels... but then - with little to no challenge - sped through the next three or four levels in a matter of seconds, reaching level 9 in no time. 3. You are not kept that well informed and the progress system is very basic. It seems that the one and only goal is to reach Level 15. There is no home-page, no star-system, no path/level-select screen, no world or areas to explore and no stats. It's very bare-bones and lacks features even bog-standard mobile game developers include in their games. The thing is, apart from crashes and game-breaking bugs, good and decent gameplay should trump everything else - and as FDR does manage to deliver in that department I have to recommend it on that basis - but I'd equally recommend that you DO NOT PAY THE full price and pick it up in a sale instead.For hundreds of reviews of indie titles please check out or follow my website through my curator page at:[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26108770-Parsons%27-Garden/]Parsons' Garden[/url]	----->	14
49163835	This is an Early Access Game, it is not finished yet. If you want a finished game don't buy it yet! Bought it yesterday and already have $2/hour for my entertainment. Worth itGreat potential, so far no game breaking bugs, just laid back relaxing making a tiny village into a tiny town into a big town into a city. There's currently very little in the way of direction so just build as much as you want. Very solid base game, just needs a little direction gameplay and content. Excited to see what they add and the direction the game goes!	----->	3
49164500	Wonderful little base building game with a great system to develop the organic town they talk about it. Regular and frequent small updates  demonstrate an engaged developer, but are also very necessary for this early access title. Balancing issues plague the game and there is a bit of a lack of content, or at least a way to stretch the content that already exists. This seems to be continously worked on, however.	----->	1
49165263	I never write a review for games, but I thought I would write one. Been playing this game for about a week or two. Long story short, the game is quite fun. There are issues in the game, but this is early Alpha so you have to take the good and the bad.I think the only thing I major issue I found is the villager mechanics when you hit above 370. The villagers seem to just slow down in their productivity, but their consumption level is still the same. At first, I thought it was the distance between their workplace and their house, but after going through several different gameplays, it looks like it is a game mechanics issue. Might be an underlying code that's cause the slowdown.However, a part of me also thinks that the issue is around building sheep farms/tailors which causes the slowdown occurs once they are built...All in all, a great game to play. I think once that the villager slowdown/standstill is fixed, I can expand the village to the entire map.	----->	9
49170865	A good game with considerably good micromanagement. Bear in mind that this is still in early access, so there're tons of bugs, but it is still playable.The only thing that grind my gears the most is towards mid to end game where you've unlocked everything, so there's basically no other things to be done than waiting for your population to grow and build more of the same structures once you've passed a certain point.	----->	6
49182747	First of all, this is the first game I bought, which is still in early access.But I must say: no regrets!Its just such a nice game, nice new ideas, a little mix between Cities: Skylines and classic RTS games.It is just so satisfying to watch your settlement grow.Sure, there are still some bugs, as expected from early access, but the devs are really invested in this game with regular updates and bug fixesOver all a very good, rewarding and calming game which I see myself playing for hours to come!	----->	9
49185475	Solid alpha. No game crashing bugs, game is fully playable and is updated frequently as it should. Can't wait to see the end result!	----->	0
49193588	I like this game.  It's pretty, fairly easy and very relaxing.Cons:Food management is kind of annoying and you have to dump a lot of resources into it as far as workers.Pros:-The random house building and upgrading is fun.  -The game doesn't punish you often (like if you build on a cliff, villagers can still get up pretty steep slopes instead of taking forever going around.-I like the soundtrack-It's visually pleasing-Decently interesting mechanics though it obviously needs a lot more but I think it'll be fine in time.TL;DR Yeah it's a little pricey but to me at least it's already a pretty fun game.	----->	12
49196351	Pretty cool game, still early but the...foundation...is pretty strong.  Excited to see where it goes.  Kind of pricey right now at 30 bucks so maybe wait if you're short on cash, but it's pretty good.	----->	3
49198470	Its expensive, however, from the way it seems, the money will be worth the game in the end. I wish they would've made it cheaper for the time being. Whatever, its a beautiful game with a solid base. Needs to have a better tutorial though...	----->	10
49198767	👍🏻	----->	0
49202957	I bought b/c it looks cool.  Not bad, but it ain't worth 30 beans.   I was going to refund but see I played over 2 hours.  So it goes.I recommend for ppl who have 30 beans to blow and don't care.  Shrug.	----->	4
49206475	Its a good game, but atm its to expencive to buy into, so if ur short on cash, dont.Id say ATM its about 10-20 hours of game time.I have some major issues with some mechanics, like how house building works, sometimes the AI puts houses so the villagers cant enter (especially when the houses upgrade)I freakwently get messages that a villager got stuck trying to go to X and then its gone.This is supose to be a lordship, so in my opinion its not supose to be super big, but to get a monestary or a church.To build my church i had to build 3-4 rustic churches cus the points they provide each is so low.Or to get higher knight hood, i spammed the same building in about 10 times.As it was my first try my money flow was a mess, and the money circulation shouldent be this hard in a casual game.Expanding ur territory is wierdly expencive with a kings tax of 50 gold per octagon. Aswell as upkeep on needed buildings for happiness racks up alot.If a villager leaves they just leave and when a villager joins they do not fill the jobb that was left behind, u need to manully find the job and put a new worker.ATM, there is a job lvl system, but its caped at lvl 1 and they become lvl 1 super fast so why even bother.Or im doing something super wrong.	----->	13
49209296	Good game, but while waiting in the main screen i can fry eggs on my graphics card. 10/10 worth your eggs to be fried by your graphics card while running this game.	----->	2
49220444	I love this fucking game, I'm waiting for more to be added but this is a solid Foundation for Foundation =P	----->	1
49223424	Its an early access game. for coming out 2/1/19 its really good as of my review of 2/24/19. I do believe that this game feels in a fairly complete state. Within 8 hours of play i only encountered 1 bug and it happened to occur while i was alt tabbing in and out a lot.I really hope to see a combat system and balancing occur. Balancing is the only part i feel isnt smooth. Its very lumpy instead of linear in difficulty. very quickly goes from to much of everything, not enough of everything, to much of everything.	----->	4
49236654	Saw this and thought it looked quite good.Booted it up just to briefly learn the controls and figure out how to play, then it was 10 hours later.Unfortunately, because the game is still in early access and not all features are in the game, I kinda hit a wall where I have buildings that currently don't do anything, but I need them to in order to progress.Although, if I could progress, that 10 hours would probably be more like 30, straight, hours. Early access may have saved my life.	----->	4
49237564	I am enjoying the game.  As now there is no challenge and limited help feature.  My current problem is that all my builders are trapped in buildings.  When I center on them I get a finished building and they are working.  The unhappiness indicator is also lacking on what is missing.  They have multiple bars but not sure what I am missing.  The game goes together well.	----->	-3
49239903	It's exactly what you would think it is!This game is a lot of fun, the deck building is the icing on the cake.	----->	0
49241131	I can't believe this game is in Early Access it feels so complete and polished, sure you will find a bug or two but nothing game breaking...Only bugs i found so far where villagers getting stuck but they despawn after a while and the fishing hut was a bit offset from the water level.Oh and your generic place holder icons for future updates.That was it other than that the game felt like a full release title, i had to ask myself in game if this was Early Access or not... i was so unsure.Love the way they approached housing in this game, you basically zone a residential area and they build their own houses but in such a way that the houses look and feel part of the landscape a very natural look to it.Buildings are modular so you get to see your small church that housed 35 villagers later expand into a abbey to accommodate more people.This gives the game a stellar look to it as you can see your small village evolve and grow as you play on .I am truly impressed with this game and highly recommend it !	----->	7

49254476	This is a great game with so much untapped potential. I hope the devs continue to work on it and introduce more content. There are a few bugs that do need to get worked out, however this being alpha, and the devs constantly updating the game, I have no fear of this game turning into everything I want it to be. As it sits right now, with the content in the game, in my honest opinion, its not worth 30 dollars. However, when more content is introduced, and more mods are made. This game will be every bit of worth the 30 dollars. Foundation in its current state - 7/10Foundation with more content and mods - 12/10	----->	9
49258573	Bottom line is, this game is great. I do understand that an early access is not for most people but I do appreciate the opportunity of playing the game now rather than later, and the feeling of being involved in its growth. Now, I see that a lot of players have an issue with the price tag. And my view on the price tag of any game is always time is money. If I can get enough hours of entertainment out of a game for the price I’ve paid, then I’m good. And this one was definitely worth my money. Now, I have 72 hours on record at the moment, I only crashed twice. Not a big issue. Did not have any glitches or major errors. The only issue I encountered was with the monastery which is a part of the game which is still not yet fully implemented so it’s understandable. But even the struggle of trying to make the production of honey and herbs work was fun.I definitely think that the cartoonish look of the game fools you into thinking you can keep on building and randomly assigning people and you’ll be good. And here is where the game really shines for me. You actually have to think and micromanage. Your bread production started going down for no reason? Think again. I figured that once people climb the social ladder they have more needs to fulfil, therefore less time to be productive - some will call them lazy, how ironic. You definitely want the commoners to do the hard work. So maybe that farm you’ve build in the beginning of the game needs to be ‘relocated’.Keep in mind that it’s an Early Access. I’m reviewing a game that’s not finished. And I’m ok with it not being finished. And I’m most certainly looking forward to seeing its evolution.	----->	3

49300969	Fun game.  Laid back city builder that allows you to create buildings, markets, castles, forts, etc, in free form or with snap-in-place pieces.City builders nowadays seem to rush you at a frantic pace while dealing with constant issues like traffic grids, natural disasters, overpopulation, you name it.  Foundation doesn't do that.  Things move at a nice, slow pace and it's easy to recover when your villagers happiness is slowly going down the drain.I'm critical about game breaking performance issues and some of the reviews are why I held off buying this game for as long as I did.  Needless to say, I haven't experienced any crashes, glitches, lost saves, stuck citizens, you name it, like other reviews have brought up.Do I recommend this game?  Absolutely.  It's a great way to unwind and build something beautiful without getting stressed about the myriad of other things that other city builders throw at you.	----->	10
49308873	It's a little buggy and not quite there as far as story and menus but this is going to be an amazing game if they develop it properly.	----->	4

49318118	30hrs in over the 2wks owned.  Beautiful & picturesque city builder with lots of room to grow.  It has some early challenges that seemed vague and difficult to complete* (SPOILER) with limited guidance.  But, aside from that, intuitive, and gorgeous little hamlets and cities can be made to order.  The screenshots they advertise do not lie, as those can be yours with a little time and effort.  Love it so far!  And, compelled me to write my 1st review.  :) (if you don't have fish ... don't try to sell someone fish! ... also, you'll need a warehouse that stores the item!)	----->	-1
49321275	This is already shaping up to be an awesome game. Coming from someone who loves things like Banished and other city building games, this is right up my alley. There's definitely some work yet to be done overall, but the base of a game created now is already a lot of fun. Looking forward to seeing how the development progresses! Will be keeping a close eye on updates in the future.	----->	6
49324404	GOOD GAME BUT A LOT OF BUGS IN THE GAME AND NOT A LOT OF NEW STUFF .VERY HARD TO GET MONEY TOO YOU CAN RUN OUT VERY FAST	----->	0
49326641	Highly recommended, what's here is a solid base for what could eventually be a great game. I'm hooked for whatever DLC comes later as long as the devs add more depth in regards to building types, monuments and environments.  Some people complain about the price, but honestly as long as the game has about twice the content/polish and half the bugs at launch then it's totally worth it.As far as suggestions for the devs, Would love to see a reason to have soldiers in the form of bandits or something that spawn late game. Also the time cycle could be a bit more in depth with a day/night cycle or seasons. Finally, walls, walls, walls, please add more types of walls of varying heights and thicknesses. I understand that it's probably too much of a pain to add the ability to walk on the walls (i.e. battlements) but walls and gates are of utmost importance for visual variance. Also please make walls need to be built like anything else, heck, you can make the cost cheap, but just having the ability to instantly place walls is kind of weird.	----->	18

49339652	This game has great potential. However i have at the population of 56 and 3 areas unlocked started to experience FPS issues, drops from about 40 FPS to 7-9 FPS. Since the game is in early access im guessing it will get fixed in due time. Overall the gameplay is understandable and the game falls under the play to have a chill time.	----->	3
49342965	This is a pretty fun mini-golf game that hits many of the right notes (including using your own mouse motion to hit the ball).  The courses vary in appearances and difficulty and there are even custom maps that vastly expand replayability.  The only wish I have is for additional settings for those that cannot adjust their mouse DPI.  Even if I crack the sensitivities to max in the options, I still struggle on courses that require long hits (especially if the courses are the hole-in-one types).I don't have a high-end computer, so I can't review the graphics, but I do like the music and the controls are good.  You can even train on certain courses not only to get a handle on learning the controls, but to practice on certain courses.  I've yet to play this game online, so I can't review that -- only the single player.  This game will give you a lot of courses to play in single player, but over time you might find the game starting to get repetitive without some friends to join in.	----->	10
49344167	I've played 100 hours. There've been lots of updates, more on the way. Lots of good QoL improvements, new resources and production chains. This is a solid town builder, with a good medieval theme over it. The particular hooks are the zoning tool with organic building growth, which I like; and customised town buildings, churches, cathedrals, etc., which I really, really like. It's implemented well and sensibly and I can create great marvels in my towns that add a lot of character to each one.	----->	14
49348821	Great game, there is no limit to what you can create in the editor. every game is a new experience. great game for a group of friends and you can usually find a group to join if youre alone	----->	1
49353032	Love it! An interesting take on city building and all that. I am having graphical issues however, I am running this game on my laptop with intel integrated graphics so I believe that may be the cause of the issue, however, while animations are running there are strange graphical glitches. People's hair will float in front of them and sometimes as I move the camera around the models sometimes glitch, being replaced by other models for a single frame, for example villagers turning into berry bushes briefly. As this game is early access I presume the lack of content will be addressed too, but the asking price is a lot for only a few hours of content. Hopefully the devs address these issues before full release	----->	-1
49354155	Considered i am reviewing an alpha i like what i see so far. (Mar.2019)The proven concept of settlers in 3d with some lego sprinkled on top makes for a good time waster.I will not address balancing issues as i am sure more than me can spot this.However, there are a few things i'd like to see to make this city builder even more amazing.- The monument mechanic is brilliant, can this be extended to apply to every resource building in the game? not only would it look amazing to have unique buildings across the board, but it would give fine tuning another level. If one could for example add more work quarters to a wood or stone cutter, or more piers to a fishermans hut then repetition would decrease. And resource consolidation could occur before the warehouse which would help in cutting down walkways in sprawling cities.- Could there be an option to pave certain ways/roads? Not necessarily to increase speed, but also for looks.Definitely a thumbs up from me!	----->	18
49378420	One of, if not the most fun multiplayer Golf games I've ever played. The maps that come with it in a fresh install are great, and a great way to learn how to play the game. The workshop provides an even better assortment of maps to play. The map maker; while not being the most fun in the world to try and use, is there and is easy enough to learn. The controls are clunky and could use a little fixing up. There are some problems with the holes not registering sometimes and others just maps not being nice to the players. 8.9/10	----->	16
49382896	Let me update my review so it comes back at the top of the list ;DSuch an awesome game which doesn't have the player base it deserves, you can find a game relatively easily, but more players means it's even easier! So come and join this community! It's a super nice community with a record so clean you can eat on it (if the record was on a paper). You can also go to the official discord and find games even faster! Did I mention the community was super nice already?One thing though, the game does NOT have very regular updates and has some every 3 months on average, this is because there is basically only 1 person working on the game (Chris Hecker, also more commonly known as Checker) but the updates are pure gold. One last thing, if you do buy the game, please, please, please! Play the tutorial before going into a game, not only is the tutorial great but if you don't play the tutorial, you won't understand a thing of what you're doing when playing with someone else, even if that person never played as well. You're not going to have fun, the other person won't have fun because they're always winning and you're not learning much because you don't understand a thing of what is happening. So just play the tutorial before playing online, for your sake and all of ours.For the original review:I spent 46 hours when I write this and this will keep going up, this game is one of the best games I have ever played, you need to try and read the mind of the sniper when you're spy and guess where he is looking, as sniper, you need to keep track of a lot of things and for me that's very entertaining. People can say it's too much money, who would pay 25 dollars for this kind of game? Well I can tell you that I am very happy with this purchase. Some reviews also say that there are not enough players and they don't receive an invite for 1 hour, I disagree totally, the best time for you to go is between 8pm and 2am gmt time and you'll for sure find players, even not at these times, you'll probably find a player after only 10 min maximum, even less if you have discord. If you do have discord, there are tournaments you can participate in and they will teach you everything you need to know about the game and you can chat with Chris Hecker (the one who developed the game) and talk about the future of the game and if you look at the news you see that he is always working on the game.tl;dr This is the best purchase I have made for a video game in a long time.	----->	44
49383703	It is just another builder. Exept, it doesn't punch you into face like banished. It does have some points, when you don't get, what's wrong... then find your own mistake and take time to overcome of it. Eventually you do. Just to find another weakspot. :)There are issues, of lacking content, but that's to be expected, at this stage.Worth the money? Maybe not just 100% yet, but in future, deffenetly. Addictive? - medium yeah Learning curve - fairly easyish	----->	1

49387948	While early in the early access cycle this game has already grown over the few weeks since I bought it. It is a very cool concept and I can't wait to see where the developers take us. Obviously the game is fairly limited at this point but there is certainly a solid core.	----->	2

49401777	You build shit and try to make a stable economy while wondering why people are leaving even though you have 100 fishing huts and literally all storages and food markets are overfilled with fish and berries.A pretty good game, make it multiplayer and finetune some mechanics and 10/10. Current 6.8/10	----->	2
49402943	Good idea and bare bone minimum foundation, you can tell most of the interface is some form of placeholder and the organic way the game treats your villagers movements by the mere act of walking creating paths is very aesthetic. However with what the game offers and how awkward it is to get into I'd say this has the potential to eventually be worth the price but needs more work. Would definitely think of picking it up again in 6 to 8 months as things progress.	----->	0
49403184	Fun for a little, but will get boring after a few hours of playtime. I would purchase this if its on sale, but not for the full pricetag. Too many other options for $25 that will get more playtime.	----->	-3
49414902	I have really enjoyed this game. It has some challenges to keep the villages happy and balanced but once you get the hang of it and you are a builder you will likely enjoy the game. It is being improved every week or so and frankly I am looking forward to getting more areas unlocked:) It certainly has great potential developers keep working at it, my villages are strong. healthy and good workers......LOL	----->	15
49417936	SpyParty is currently a good game, that should eventually be an excellent game. A unique multi-player experience, with charming visuals and fun game play. If you enjoy outfoxing your friends in a battle of wits, using hoodwinkery and at times outrageous blufferey, you will have a thoroughly good time with SpyParty. On the surface SpyParty's game play mechanics seem quite straightforward, and while the game is very easy to grasp, there is considerable amount of strategy to find under the surface.  Discovering ways to up your spy/sniper game is a joy with friends (especially over discord), and bragging about your secret 'next-gen strats' after each victory never gets old.	----->	21

49425995	I Have been wanting a game like this for a very long time, it has everything i want in a city builder plus the right time frame as well. if you are looking at this game and wondering about replay ability. the standard edition of this game has me glued to it. and if you like mods? their is a whole list of player made mods right at your fingertips! no downloading third party *Cough* (Twitch) for those that really don't want the added crap on the PC like me. simply click the mod button scroll to a list of any type of mod you could want, and install. Now lets get to the game in general. Base Game is to say the least the best $33.99CDN i spent on a game in a long time. i mostly have been an MMO player for the past 20 years. and the last 15 years i have been waiting for a game like this. Few things need mentioning. is remember its in Alpha, so with that a few needed patches on balancing need to happen. the game can be a little tough to understand regarding the trading and stockpiling of goods. and i really wish quests were a scroll down tab selection rather than a random pop up. Soon as they fix the balancing of the game this will be for sure AAA+. To Sum it up, you don't want to pass on this game even in its alpha stage it is very smooth and looks amazing lots of land to develop and tons of fun 5 Stars from me hands down. Great Job Polymorph Games you have a winner on your hands!	----->	23
49434817	Q - Is it playable/enjoyable right now?A - YES.Q - Are there bugs?A - Few. I haven't experienced any that break the game though.Q - Does it scratch the Settlers itch?A - Oh boy does it.Q - How is the Performance?A - Excellent. I saw no performance hit all the way up to 50 civilians (I haven't gone higher yet). No lagging, choppiness, etc.Looking forward to / Wishlist:-More buildings / jobs-Level progression for people (please make it unlimited OR a very high level. capping it at something like 3, 5, or 10 is a bit of a buzzkill)-Perks for level progression-More Building upgrades (for houses AND for production buildings)-More maps-Larger Maps-Map edges (it just falls into a void right now)-Procedurally generated maps-Campaigns / Scenarios-More Quests-Rival / Ally factions on shared maps-Animals-Seasons-Weather-Civilian lifecycle (birth, death, status buffs / ailments)Overall excellent Job so far.

49474431	Got this game the same time I got Dawn of Man. The foundation for Foundation is pretty solid and the devs are great at communicating and are doing a great job at fixing bugs in a fast and promptly manor. Game is still in alpha and I look forward to my contribution to helping the game grow. As of now it is pretty bare bones city builder but the amount of control you have is amazing. Def recomend for those that like City builders and want to help the devs move it along. Just like the DoM devs i think other devs could learn a few things about communication and how to promptly follow feedback and fix bugs fast like these devs. Def recomend wether you get it now in is Alpha stage or wait until it is released. Can not wait to see what this game turns in to!!!	----->	21
49482080	Amazing game blyat.8/9 would play again	----->	0
49483861	It is a cute game, but they changed some of the rules like:gameplay change: hitting special monsters without backstabbing them gives no xp (it used to give 1). This simplifies reading levels to max out xp.But they did not update the algorythm or preset levels to reflect that, so every so often you just run into insovable levels, puzzles, game is just fundamentally broken.	----->	1
49484042	After spending six hours shaping and forming my very own little city I found my self a little bit strapped for things to do - HOWEVER... this is an alpha stage development....AI has a remarkable auto path finding systemhousing is very time efficient - paint the floor green and watch the villagers deploy the appropriate volume of houseschoosing how much land is allocated to gathering, farming or housing is really really good and more customised the system for production and trade is (in my opinion) is perfect - in order to supply the city you must first supply the industries with the appropriate trades and materials - in order to advance...what i would like to see: Naval units Multiplayer for the sake of trade? EG i can visit and view the cities of friends on steam & trade with their NPC units/cities better yet why not have a map devided by a large body of water, you building on the east coast - me building on the west... then bridge the river and trade Higher tiers of upgrades and abilites for trades and buildings villagers to arrive in higher droves after certain mile stones.... as it is only ever 2 villagers a time'is the game worth 26 pounds? probably not... given that its current state is less than half of the potential content - HOWEVER i do understand and accept that the Devs are infact updating the game on a very regular basis, and will be releasing content in due time...Do i recommend this game ? Absolutely yes	----->	19

49502874	For being early access this is a stupidly fun game, highly addicting.

49503609	Foundation is a city builder that is both fun and rewarding to play.I am unable to stop the game due the the addictive mechanics.My only complaint so far is the UI:- font size too small- color scheme makes not immediately clear if an option has been selected- in the beginning, the citizen management was confusing: I was not sure if I indeed selected the right occupation- trade routes should be streamlined: some UI indicators should be present when some goods cannot be sold/purchased- clearer indicators of citizens witohut jobs or facilities without personnelI am confident in that these concerns will be dealt with in time.	----->	8
49503998	This is seriously an amazing game! The fact that the villagers make their own pathways is this phenomenal. The cartoonish style of the game is something fresh and amazing too.  The only thing i wish for with these games, is a sort of co-op possibility. That you can build a city/town together or just some trading that you can do together. Besides that, i absolutely love this game!	----->	13
49507120	It is real fun, easy to learn and fun to play	----->	5
49509496	I've had the chance to play this game for a bit and it's been a good time so far. It's clearly an early access game, but the gameplay loop is solid, and it's incredibly satisfying to see your tiny town grow and change. The monument building mechanic is a lot of fun, and is a nice change of pace from the organic building that comes from setting up building/extraction zones. I am looking forward to further development and the finished game from the developers.	----->	9
49512345	MUST BUY GAME I JUST LOVE IT	----->	0
49518161	Similar to Banished and Life is Feudal: Forest Village, which both I've put some time into, this game offers another fresh and unique take on the genre. I have to be honest here, I'm falling in love with this game. The progression through the quest feels timely and balanced so it keep me engaged and always looking ahead but I'm not waiting forever for something. The mechanics of the zoning is so unique that every game I play it's always different, and I get to see my village grow before my eyes, not as I intended, but as my village intended. Yes it's still an alpha game and it still has some bugs or is just unfinished in some areas, but if you're looking for a fresh new medieval city builder I would recommend this game. It's a blast.	----->	8
49518492	Finally a City-Building Simulation that does fit in perfectly between games like Age of Empires and Anno. It doesnt rely a grid-based placement like Anno, so your cities will really look authentic and natural (I always hated those symmetrical Cities in Anno..). Furthermore, the focus (as it is now) is much more on economy and fine-tuning your efficiency (e.g. let habitants of houses nearby to a working facility work there instead of a worker living half an hour away) than on war and survival (not implemented yet, but likely to come into the game) like the AoE series.So if you like self-building streets and awesome building-tools for custom made monuments like cathedrals and monasteries, and can tolerate that a few  features aren't polished yet (I didn't experience any gamebreaking bugs), this game is (and will be) an honest game that appeals to many different kinds of players.	----->	16

49628752	This is a beautiful, relaxing city builder. The graphics are quirky and lovely to look at, and the music is beautiful. The ambient sounds are pitched perfectly so as to enhance the gaming experience and really bring the world to life.This is still a work in progress so I've noticed a couple of possible bugs. At one point two of my carriers got stuck whilst trying to collect some stone from a warehouse for a build. In the end I deleted the new build and this freed them. I then replaced the new build in a slightly different location and everything was fine.The way the houses are built in a non linear way really gives your towns and cities a sense of organic development, a refreshing change from all the grid placed builders out there. You can create your own styles of buildings by adding extensions and changing things like building height. Pieces lock together, or you can meld them together so you can have the church tower growing out of the main core building. You even get a choice of the sound of the church bell.If you love building cities at a relaxed pace, peppered with the occasional quest, then this is the game for you. The developers seem to be working really hard to get this game right and polished, as there are regular updates with fixes and new features.The trailer says the only limit is your imagination, and so far this seems to be very true.The price point may put some people off of buying an uncompleted game, but once you start building your kingdom you soon realise its actually quite reasonable. This is not a game for those who like fast pace fps or rts. This game is purely a city builder, allowing for a more natural lifelike growing experience.	----->	17
49634603	I'm not sure which genre this game falls into. Tower defense, card game, strategy... It most closely resembles Clash Royale, but is better in practically every way, so I'm reluctant about comparing them. It has minion, structure and spell cards like CR but they don't get more powerful as you unlock more, you just get more exp after the match for having alot of duplicates. It has a very good f2p model, not pay to win; this becomes apparent when you look at the decks of the top ranking players, most of them only have one or two legendary cards which can be put in any type of deck, the rest of them are easy to come by. The game is easy to understand, the strategies become more advanced as you progress through ranks so you won't be overwhelmed as a new player. There is profile progression with rewards, ranking system etc. Has a 1v1 and 2v2 option and ocasional events. Art style is very nice, has plenty of settings for low end pcs. Overall a very good game, definetly worth checking out.	----->	20

49642091	Massive potential. I've been keeping an eye on it a while and jumped at the chance to snag it at early access. While quite buggy at it's current state, it's still thoroughly enjoyable and I'm super excited to see where it goes. Not only that but the devs have been updating it every week, so great job guys/gals. This is the first city-builder I've really gotten into since the Settlers and hopefully it turns into a classic.	----->	13

49692752	I enjoyed this game a lot, built 2 cities up to 200+ citizens. It's quite easy to grasp the concept and gameplay. Good, relax city building with not much punishment or disaster (unless you decide to delete the market without having resource and gold to build a new one asap). The large building customization is gold.There'are rooms for improvements, and some features are still incomplete. The game is quite sloooowwww with even maxed speed. Job assigning ca be frustrating to get them into the right place if they live a little too far from that spot. I barely run into any bug, but when I did, it was just minor ui bugs, nothing big and can easily be ignored.  Overall, I really recommend this game, it's like watching an ant colony :)	----->	2

49730009	I absolutely love this game. I can't wait to see where it ends up in the future. One thing I did notice was that once your population gets to a certain point the happiness is impossible to maintain. You aren't able to increase food production without creating even more population problems because you need so many jobs for everything. As well the economy starts going down hill the larger your city is.	----->	6
49740406	Great city building sim. The way housing works is a nice refresh for the genre. Definitely looking forward to more content updates	----->	3
49742718	I actually really enjoy this game! I know it's in the early stages so there is a lot that can be improved on but it's fun. I like how the villagers upgrade their homes and reroute the road when things are in their way. I believe they could improve on how to gain splendor, but that isn't a huge issue. I also wish I could build a castle (but honestly, I may not have gotten that far in the game to unlock castle-like buildings). I cant wait for them to improve this game and to see what they can come up with for add-ons!	----->	14
49745744	This is a great game if you're into relaxing medieval city building. The way you paint on the landscape to show your villagers what to do is an awesome game mechanic i have never really experienced before this and its very satisfying to watch your villagers cut down the trees you've requested or plant crops. Great game and i hope to see much more from this team.	----->	8

49791653	If you enjoy building a city and watching it grow, this is a good game. If you're creative and love building castles and gothic churches, you will LOVE this game. This is a beautiful game to look at and enjoy. It is far from perfect from a simulation/resource management perspective. Lots of kinks to work out but it is fully playable (I've got 45 hours into it, so um, yeah it's plenty playable). It's Alpha, there are some bugs and quirks and unfinished things. This is very much like Banished only more creative building wise. If you are more into the simulation aspect, you might want to wait a bit. I lean towards building/creation and this is a big thumbs up for me.	----->	23

49821381	Minion masters is an excellent game in my opinion. It's being constantly developed and balanced, and new content is added at regular intervals. Battles tend to be quick and hectic, and I especially like the 2 vs 2 mode. I highly recommend it!	----->	7
49822202	The pinnacle of masculinity, Spy Party, requires you to endure the pains and suffering of life. These tortures include shooting the wrong asian twin or prejudice disabled/colored people. It is almost a microcosm of our current society where MIDGETS PREVAIL. Overall, this game is too powerful for your mere mortal body.	----->	-6
49825166	First off let me start by saying those who complain are selfish and arrogant because they forget that the game is only about 40% done. It is also  still very much in early access so unless you can't be patience then please go shove It. Give the devs a chance to work out bugs and glitches. People seem to forget that games take time to fully develop. I think that foundation will be a great game once It is done. I haven't played It much simply because It just came out and plus because there are other games that Interest me right now and It's not because of the bugs that the game has. Give the game a few months and it will be a great game. Foundation may lack with features and content but It is enjoyable to play and I will It once It gains steam.	----->	0

49834606	I have played this game for almost a week. As most people said, there are many bugs, but it has great potential. I’m looking forward to the next update.My own opinions on the current state of the game:1.There are many systems in the game that are not yet fully open, such as combat systems, commodity systems, trading systems, weather systems, etc. I hope it can be updated quickly.2.The character rest system is very interesting but also a bit flawed. For example, a character can only rest after returning to his house. Is there no pub in the entire city? Which can also serve the passing travelers.3.The sources of food in the game is really not enough, fruit, bread, fish, where is my favorite beef and pork? How can anyone live in the Middle Ages without meat? At least give my citizen a chicken farm, chicken will be OK!4.I wish the buildings that can be upgraded by themselves are not only the houses of the residents, but also the public facilities, which can be more effective as the small city continues to prosper.5.The trading system is still a semi-finished product, but for now, things are available for trading is too few. Production-rich products are completely unsaleable. Trading in the Middle Ages should be far more prosperous than this.. I really wish to see a trade caravan, or have a trading port at sea, instead of a small person carrying a 20-inch suitcase to trade with me.6.I want horses. HORSES!URGENT NEED FOR UPDATE:1.National language systems. I played in English for several days, for there are too many bugs when I chose Chinese. 2.UI..... Well, I hope it can do better after the update. However, what makes me feel really uncomfortable is that I have to search every house in the whole city to find a resident (when I do not remember his name ). What a medieval way of management.3.There is no data on the consumption and acquisition of various materials in the game. I am a city owner, but I can't even ask how many food we have harvested this month. Which makes resource planning difficult to go ahead.My English is still in the learning stage, I am doing so hard..  Hoping that game developers can see... :)	----->	15
49850823	I absolutely LOVE this game. However, the game realies heavily on playing with a group of friends. Even if you aren’t into golf as much, the game has an array of creative people building fascinating new levels through the steam workshop, making the experience much more than ‘just golf’. In addition, you can muck around with the settings, to change up the rules of golf or to personalise your ball. But if you aren’t sure about the game, go watch YouTubers play it (many do XD).	----->	5

49856556	Great game. Has its issues, bugs here and there (for example: sometimes maps have solid objects you can't get through like you're supposed to, but the rest of the players can - has happened a few times). With the right group of people this is amazingly fun. Can also drive you completely insane too.	----->	2

49882837	Fun for what it has to offer. It is in Alpha so I am not going to nitpick what its lacking. I defiantly feel the developers deserve our support as this game has great potential.Edit:This game is way different thank when I first played and reviewed it. I did not log many hours when I first purchased the game as the content was limited. Coming back over a year later I will defiantly be sinking some hours into this game. Very enjoyable.	----->	7
49897801	This is pretty fun so far, alot of the AI are smart enough to make new paths for them selves and do their best to grab resources even if you mismanage the distances between the resource and buildings haha. Im looking forward to when the game gets more updates that makes use of the Hunters hut and the soldiers and also expands on more food sources other than just berries and bread and fish	----->	10
49898834	great game already played 2 hour and loved it but it needs some fine tuning  hope we get regular  updates	----->	10
49912721	Not terribly balanced, but a good game nonetheless. What I mean by not terribly balanced is that the whole game seems to favor melee weapons on almost impossibly fast builds or heavy ordinance on almost immobilized ones over any other build.Overall, though, it has a nice scenery selection and, despite what others may say, is not pay to win, it is pay to PROGRESS, as anyone can have access to any weapons that are in packs without buying the pack, but buying the pack gives a surefire way to get these parts without spending 10 days earning the coins to buy it or getting the parts to craft it.Amendment to the review: During the past while of playing, I've discovered that a majority of times, I seem to find myself alone in my build versus a whole enemy team, as if the matchmaking is favoring the other team's powerscore over my team's. It leads to issues with the gameplay, making it tedious to play, and above all even more tedious to grind. This is already a grind-heavy game.Overall, I would still recommend this game, even if very slightly, because the Chernobyl Disaster Remnants-esque playerbase is a lovely place for laughs.	----->	0
49914948	An awesome game, would totally recomend.Even though its only in its ALPHA state, game is 10 times better than most of the same genre games.Pros:Very cool customisation possibleCustom layoutIn depth control of villages and areas of excavationLots of features can be addedMods support from ALPHA!!!!!!Cons:Too early to spend too much time yet, but I will keep in touch.Totally worth to support the developers.	----->	13
49915378	This is my new favorite game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys city builders. It is early access but already very playable and I can't wait to see how it develops.	----->	6
49915987	I like city building games.  They don't [i]have[/i] to incorporate violence in them, and they don't have to have a heavy focus on the simulation (economy, trade, etc.) aspects.  This game fit that need, but only for a bit - this is fine though, it is still in Early Access.I'd love to say that you should buy the game because it is great fun and worth your money, or don't buy the game there isn't enough content to hold your interest for what it costs.  Both are true and not exactly true at the same time - because it comes down to personal preference.I can say that I didn't encounter any game breaking bugs, the performance was fine, and the game delivers on most of its promises.  I can also say that there comes a point where the game simply doesn't feel as much fun once out of the 'honeymoon' phase, the UI still needs tweaking, the AI still needs some tweaking, and it definitely needs more content.So, where does that leave us?  If you'd like to give the devs your money so to show your support and help them keep working on the game - buy it.  If you want to wait for a fuller and richer experience - wait.  If it doesn't appeal to you - skip it completely.For me...I'll recommend it for now.  I enjoyed it and will play again as they continue to improve the game.	----->	33

49952130	The devs put hard work into this game, it has a solid base and a ton of potential. The lower price is what is allowing me to recommend buying it as it is now. It's a working early access so far as I know (with how far I am in the game).	----->	3
49952249	Such fun.	----->	0
49952651	If you're like me, you dream about games as complex and interesting as this shit. I get to see a city I design grow up and turn into a bustling city full of buildings that I've designed myself. This game is an amazing experience and I highly recommend it to all you obsessive geeks out there.	----->	11
49961313	I won't lie, usually I don't recommend a game if its good I just won't rip it to pieces.  But this game deserves it.  Let's go through the list: 1: the graphics are actually surprisingly beautiful, especially if you zoom in on the stone structures its quite easily one of the prettiest games of its kind.2: The devs are responsive, and not robotic like some developers I've encountered in the past and I appreciate that immensely so I felt they deserved props for it.  From responding to bug reports, to being present and updating people in the community and in discord these guys really are doing a great job.  3: The systems of the game are, while somewhat complex in some aspects they are very logical and once you get a feel for them it'll come naturally.4: Designing your own monuments:  This I can't stress enough I love it!  This may be a bias i have because of my field of studies but the fact that I can design and watch as my churches, and monasteries are constructed truly makes me happy.  The scale of the structures too is up to you, you can pick whether or not its a huge, towering cathedral with spirals topped with crosses, or gargoyles  its really that detailed and I love it.  5: They are updating and working on the game quite often.  The updates do legitimately fix bugs, and the changes are usually fairly noticeable.  For instance, I was experiencing a glitch on one level once I hit ~102 citizens.  I tried that, actually today on the map I'm now making my mega monastery on, and I'm sitting at 150 citizens.  Personally, I give this one a 10/10, guys great work and keep it up.	----->	18
49979214	FOR NOW I cannot recommend this game for $30, but I'm still recommending the game in general nonetheless.It's honestly pretty fun and I anticipate it'll get even better, but it simply does not have enough content to be worth $30. It takes maybe 2-3 hours to make a 50+ person city with every resource type in production, and once you've reached that point you're pretty much done. If you're a die-hard city-builder/resource management fan, or you can grab it on sale for $15 or so, then it might be worth picking up, but for now it's probably best to pass until more features are added. There are also quite a few bugs that can be very frustrating, but obviously it's still in its Alpha/Early Access stage, so once more features are added and bugs fixed, I think it will be even better.	----->	16
49983584	Ignore all the reviews saying this game isn't worth the money. It might not seem like a lot at first, but there's an absolute TON of depth to it, and there's enough variety in the stages/missions to make what's there stretch out for a long time. If you're the kind of person who enjoys deception-based, Spy Party is well worth your time. I have yet to find a better lying game on Steam (I guess discounting Tabletop Sim, which cheats by letting you play all of the deception-based board games that exist already).	----->	9
49989895	It's about time Steam had a star rating system for games, like, say, trustpilot or tripadvisor. I don't want to give a thumbs down as it's early access and so still being developed but neither do I want to give it a thumbs up. Read on.At this time I give (because there's no other option) a begrudging thumbs up.It's great to look at, the graphics are very well done, luscious even. Where it falls down, and I'm conscious that it isn't yet finished, is the little niggles that annoy. Like when I hover the mouse over the population icon to find out why my townsfolk aren't happy and it tells me that x don't have enough food. Hmmm, looking at my resource list and the contents of my abundant warehouses there are copious amounts of all different types of food, and there are a multitude of market stalls to provide said townsfolk with access to these.I could type, almost verbatim from the paragraph above, about the same issue with clothing, yet my people are apparantly unhappy as they don't have access to these too.Earning favour with the Clergy and the Townsfolk is relatively easy, but earning it with the king requires you to build lots of keeps, these then need to be populated with soldiers who do nothing but add further demands onto the housing, food and clothing supply chains.I'm going to give the game a rest until it developed further.	----->	4

50023834	I think this game has a lot of potential. I'm enjoying it a lot, even in its alpha state. Given its modest price point, if you love city builders, definitely check this one out. I do have some opinions which are below, I could be completely misinformed or wrong here, but none the less:UI / UX:- Iconography could be a lot more clear- Setting things up in markets and storehouses needs to be refined and more clear at a glance.- Small tweaks across the board like your game time arrows - they're both aimed the same way, flipping the one on the left 180 degrees so it creates a speed up slow down icon pair makes more sense.- I would suggest removing the heavy borders of each screen, they give a very top heavy feel to the UI.- Set up an overlay to see how supply chains are running (use arrows connecting to buildings) so I can see how goods are flowing.Science/Research:- I would like to see a skill / research tree that I can invest into.- I would love to see those choices matter.- More crops and things to set upAdventure/Pressure:- While I do like the leisurely pace of the game, what would put it over the top for me is if there was *some* sense of urgency and adventure.  I would like to see more exploration into:-- Walls cost resources, and matter.-- Regular enemies invade my town so that my defenses matter.-- More defenses to build like wall towers, catapults, ballistae, archers, knights, etc.	----->	18

50167359	EDIT: This game is clearly a labor of love for the team behind it and after months away I came back to find significant quality of life improvements and new mechanics. Some things are not super clear (like equipping your soldiers with weapons manually) but the process of advancing makes more sense. This game is great, even if it's unfinished.What I like about it:- 'monument' buildings are customizable and variable, giving you creative control over some aspects of the game- the graphics are adorable- you can follow villagers, see why they're unhappy, and reassign them to jobs if needed- despite an intro guide on the game, most of the game is intuitive if you've played city builders before- zones are a neat idea and allow you to change and update your village as neededWhat I don't like much:- much is left unexplained, like quests. I failed a quest because I didn't hit a checkmark.- when your city gets large, the framerate slows down significantly- while monuments are adjustable, they're not well explained and advancing to higher tier buildings can be challenging- trade routes are static, and rarely very beneficial what I'd like to see:- I'd like to see the envoy from [CITY NAME] have a city- more guidance on early game advancements; the king gives you missions to complete some buildings to advance your progress but they are very sparsewhat entertained me:- my current city is so large the game can no longer generate names so I have about 60 people named something like Woman #1696 and Man #172 I look forward to the updates this game features but I'd like to see a lot more polish and finishing	----->	25

50202876	Review for Early Access Build. The definition of 'Comfy Gaming'.Graphics: Cartoon-like, Bright and Appealing, Foundation has visuals to please your eyes (particularly a gorgeous DOF effect)Buildings are clean and easily distinguished between. Very satisfying to watch your fledgling town grow from humble beginnings to a huge metropolis. Wonders are simply that. wonderful.There are some static animations here and there and I noticed a small glitch where the roof of a building would build before the foundation leaving a floating mesh but these are things that will be patched and new animations are being shown in the DEV LOG. I'm stating it here for anyone who might be put off by this but I'm sure these will be fixed. overall great visualsSound: Music is very relaxing and suits the gameplay perfectly. Reminds me of Jeremy Soules Work at times.Villagers are weirdly silent. I'm sure there will be voices added in down the line and it does not affect gameplay in the slightest. ambient sounds of birds everyday city life add to the atmosphere.Overall great audio.Gameplay: Collecting resources and growing your town is very reminiscent of the settlers series. everything works as you would expect it to minus a couple of small issues. Trading is not quite as fleshed out as it could be. there seems to be only one format for trading off the bat but, again, I'm sure the devs will add these features down the line also. It seems that it's very difficult to achieve a 'fail state' in the game (aside from irreversibly ruining your economy) I'm not sure if this is something the devs will address and will update this review if I learn otherwise. Overall Casual gameplay with systems and features to be added over time. still very satisfying and fans of settlers or cities skyline style games will surely eat this up!Lootboxes/Micro-transactions: NONE! Devs seem like really good people and I genuinely believe this game will become an even better deal than it already is! I urge you to pick this up!	----->	15
50210213	Haven't enjoyed an alpha this much since minecraft or ksp. In emulating the city management of SimCity or City Skylines and the resource management of Anno, this game surpasses both.  The way roads are shaped is revolutionary and brilliant, albeit frustrating at times.I would definitely recommend supporting this game in this phase because I really want to see it completed, and you probably will too.	----->	2
50233641	Fun medieval city builder game. A bit pricey and lacking in content as of now but with the recent devblog and patch I'm confident that they will continue to patch in fixes and content. Keep up the good work guys and I look forward to what your game has to come!	----->	5

50262012	I really like this game and so I'm going to recommend it but it is incomplete. It has placeholder text all over the place and the UI desperately needs polish. There's hard to read pink text. Labels draw outside of their buttons, windows are way off screen when using UI scaling and the UI is dreadfully tiny without UI scaling. However, the game itself runs great and it is absolutely playable.	----->	3

50322412	Foundation is a very refresh to the city builder genre, if you are into City Builder. Definitely recommend this if you want a medieval style city builder. It has many cool and unique design elements to it that make the game a lot of fun to play.	----->	8

50357767	Great game it is very fun to play and very entertaining.	----->	4
50362169	This game provides the most relaxing, almost Zen-like experience I have ever had while playing a video game.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  It is a city-building game (alright - technically a medieval village-building game).  The point is to build a successful village, and to do so in a completely organic, non-grid based fashion.  Your villagers are active participants in this process, as they go about the business of living their own semi-autonomous lives.  They build their own houses and see to their own needs - the only input they particularly need from you is a job description.  From their point of view you are less Lord and more Human Resources Department.  There is currently nothing to kill in this game (unless you count trees) and I sincerely hope it stays this way.  The video game world is full to overflowing with 'Kill Them And Take Their Stuff' kinds of games, but Foundation provides a beautiful, peaceful and refreshing change of pace.  Do yourself a favor and take this game for a spin.  You won't regret it.	----->	9

50380496	My go to preference for a golfing game with friends. I like this better than Golf with Your Friends because I find it's net code to be better. The Friends one is just super laggy.There's really not much to say about golf games like these right? There's a workshop with cool things and there's fun to be had playing with friends. It doesn't have as much content and all that stupid shit like triangle balls that Friends has but being able to play without insane lag makes this the golf game of choice for me and my friends.	----->	7

50532934	So far playing this game I found it a really fun and relaxing planning game. The design is solid and runs smoothly on my laptop which is about 3 years old now.My own issues is that population growth is a bit too slow for me. People do not seem to give birth in this game and therefore rely solely on migrations that can take 7 days in game time.As well as this, the happiness gauge does need some work as the symbols of the needs of villagers are not clear when hovering over it so sometimes it is hard to know what is needed in the town.Regardless of this it has been a fantastic game and i have not stopped me playing it. I look forward to updates and really hope it does not die like Banished did!Keep it up!	----->	15

50626215	You liked Banished but it was dour and the modding was weird.You think City Skylines looks great but you hate industrial stuff and don't want to be doing the post-60s architecture.Yeah, this is the game you want. It's gorgeous, still a teeny bit buggy and missing images here and there but it's so good! It's just what you want!	----->	1

50648420	After several hours of additional game play I have to say you guys have out done yourselves and I'm very heartened to see you listened to community feedback.   I very much look forward to this little world you're building to continue to grow :).	----->	0
50651802	Disclaimer: I put >40 hrs, including my time before Steam EA.If you want it be a party game, it's a great party game. If you want it to be competitive, hoo boy, it gets intense. SpyParty does asymmetric game design right. I'm really impressed with how deep and stressful this game can be!The community is super friendly... but also worryingly small. New updates also come slow. The game is already great fun as it stands, but these issues really are unfortunate.	----->	18
50665691	--Alpha build 1.1.12--Similiar to Banished - But smoother, softer graphics. Less involved. Similiar to City:skylines/SimCity/Cities XL - But set in a medieval era and more simplistic.What it offers: Build buildings by sections, simplistic production lines, spawn sheep for days, villager happiness/needs, simple quests, atmospheric music, relaxing ambient sounds, pleasingly simple graphics, aesthetic decorations/buildings, easy to learn.What it doesn't *CURRENTLY* offer: Indepth trade/economy/military systems, polished graphics/gameplay, long hours of gameplay/replayability, hunting, fighting, proper tutorials.If you're looking for a medieval citybuilder/town management game for your downtime - this is it. If you're looking for something that's super involved, indepth and polished - then keep looking. For what's available in the game, I think it's worth playing for those who like the genre and just want a leisurely game. I was skeptical when I bought it, from looking at reviews, but it turned out to be just the kind of game I had hoped it to be! It's only in it's very early stages and I already love playing it. It does feel a bit pricey and possibly it is for what's available. But the team are very transparent and honest about their work and what's happening with the game and are actively working on it around the clock - So if the price of a game isn't a huge issue, I recommend buying it as it'll see updates regularly.	----->	17
50680706	Beautiful village building game which offers a lot to do, with very little micro management required. The art and sounds work together to create a warm and peaceful atmosphere.My let's play video for foundation: https://youtu.be/BF7YSJ-xlK8	----->	3
50693388	I don't write a lot of reviews for games but will for this one. Golf It is a really nice, fun game.  Most maps are pretty to look at. The controls are intuitive enough and although the textures of the greens could do with a make-over, the overall play-ability is there.  There's a few bugs to overcome but nothing we shouldn't expect for early access. The devs are always updating the game so I can see this being the go-to party game for some time.  The community base is massive, which is never more evident in the quantity and quality of workshop content. For £5.99 this is a steal.	----->	5
50710817	Very fun game to play with friends or solo.I don't usually buy early access games, but this game is in such a good state that I have no bad things to say about it.There are so many workshop levels that you won't run out of levels to play.	----->	3
50716010	I've played it for a while and so far its really good. i just wish there was a bit more explanation for things, particularly consequences and trading. there have been a few times where i find myself drastically in debt and not even knowing why (big custom buildings are expensive lol) and the upkeep to income ratio is a bit odd. i'm still not *exactly* sure on how much i gain from market revenue and if multiple markets of the same goods works. (also for any players reading this; don't get too many territories to fast, those put me i debt quick too)tldr; fantastic game so far, economy takes a bit to learn it, don't do too much too fast.	----->	3

50785593	Once you have done the maps that come with the game it feels a bit empty; but that is why the workshop is there! Love the game and it is best played with at least 2 others (but sometimes I just play through a couple of maps with music on, alone). The different modes of the maps are a feature I don't use but it is nice to have them.	----->	6
50787571	Lots of potential but the guide and training is lacking. An improved guide and improved menu to help with management will allow this game to flourish. Still worth picking up in its current state	----->	9
50790384	good	----->	3
50793100	Before I got this game, I was depressed all of the time. Everyday I would just sit in my room in the dark on my computer all day and I was even contemplating suicide. Then I found this game and it turned my whole life around. It pushed me to go out more and be more social. Now, I have a girlfriend and we play this game all the time because it reminds me of how good my life is and today I realized with all of this good stuff happening in my life, why don't I thank the people who turned my life around. So in conclusion, I would just like to say thank you to the creators of this game and anyone who supported the creation of it because you all saved my life.	----->	14
50815872	After 125 hours playing while writting i can absoluttly recomend this game for people who love magic the gathering, heartstone or feria. Any Collectible trading card game really. Your card comes to life on a map in 1vs1 or 2vs player duells. Each game take about 2-5 min avarage, some games takes up to 8 min. Great for casual play or for people who cannot decicate to much time undisurbed. From i bought early accsess to realese for 5 euro, I had not spent any money on the ingame shop. The game was generous with ingame reward for winning and completing quests so, mabye more so than simuluar games. Its a deckbuilding game where you can choose different heroes with different abilities to command you deck. The cards come alliive on a 3d map with 2 lanes. Units placement and card comboes play a big role: as well as the paper, rock siccor part of the strategy. You start with some mana and gain more with time, each card cost mana. Will you rush a attack or wait and counter? what if both player wait untill maxiimum mana before they play any card? These are the questions you must answer in this awessome free to play game!	----->	18

50847174	After a year this game is still well balanced.  A deck made entirely out of starter cards is completely viable.  No pay to win shenanigans going on here.	----->	3
50851110	Its very fun	----->	4
50852828	I'm not huge on the genre, but this roguelike's clever twist  of scrubbing back and forth to find the perfect strategy ffor each floor is really entertaining.	----->	6
50854016	  A surprisingly robust game with good physical assets [ meaning visual and sound quality ]  Can be played casually or competetive , rewards are frequent enough to play a few rounds each day   Overall very little grief to be had , friendly community , ease of matchmaking and interface elements   I recommend this for all ages but especially if you have friends to play with its less stressful than most other multiplayer games	----->	13
50856611	better than clash royale and most other card games that i've played, and i've just started playing it, so i'm expecting a lot more awesomeness from this game :)	----->	0
50859446	Its good but at the moment it's very shallow. I don't know an awful lot about the game but after around 10 hours of the first time ever playing it i had unlocked everything with very little effort. I hope that isn't the end...	----->	2

50955985	As this is the Early Access - yes there are some visual glitches (in an otherwise STUNNING visual game), but I still am very excited about this game - even in it's current state.

50966258	After playing the game again recently, I noticed that my original issue with the broken bridges has been fixed. Overall, the game is enjoyable and worth the purchase price. **************************************************************I was enjoying the game up until the point at which I realized that bridges are not working properly. I was able to build two bridges after about ten attempts. I needed to build a third bridge but it just wouldn't work. I gave up after about fifteen attempts. I tried various locations and as many different bridge configurations (different lengths, angles relative to shore, etc.) as I could think of, but I was not able to figure out why I succeeded in building the first two bridges but not the third. I also tried reloading the game.	----->	3
50980096	For all the haters....Here it goes, for a game that is still not perfect and needs some adjustments I still...LOVE IT!!! This is the most relaxing city builder, with super funny graphics, no stress and with enormous potential to be an even more amazing game! And even with all the needed fixes, it's still playable as it is and SUPER enjoyable!Kudos to the all developer teams and helpers, please keep going with additional fixes, buildings and...MORE MAPS!! <3 from a big fan!	----->	15

51013692	I can look past the bugs since this game is in alpha and  will be watching development closely in the coming months. Foundation has the potential to be a standout title, we will just have to hope for the best. For $30 it was a steal for me..  50 hrs so far and hopefully more to come!I do wish they would change the fishing hut to something visually appealing, especially when you have 15 of 'em lined up.. 	----->	3
51024244	Very awesome fluid, natural medieval city builder. The path making and grid-less zoning produces very neat patterns and organic looking towns. the monument building system is great. Working up to grand cathedrals and keeps is fun, and makes every city unique.Content is on-going, but the framework for a very awesome city-builder is there. Probably only 10 hrs of content available at the moment. VERY Beta level content. lots of missing names and icons and animations.	----->	10
51031897	like Banished but I think this will have more potential. Downloaded it 5 hours ago and haven't stopped playing, I'm excited to see how they develop it further.	----->	4

51035442	This is a casual medieval city-builder, and if you enjoy that, then I recommend Foundation. Once you learn the basics, there's no way to lose unless you try. If you're looking for a city-builder that challenges you, then I cannot recommend this game. This isn't Banished.The game is still in early development, so if the game gets harder, I'll update my review.	----->	5

Though I've returned the game to store, and sought a refund, I'll still give it a Thumbs Up, but only because it looks like a game with real interest and potential on You Tube. :O[	----->	3
51107020	I don't know why people are saying terrible things about this game.  I fucking love it.  It is relaxing and challenging enough to keep playing through.  They have done a great job making a game that a guy can come home from work and just chill the fuck out for an hour.  It is early access and you dipshits are complaining about placeholders...  Suck a dick you morons.  These guys are kicking ass and you should support their work.  This is a great game and I can't wait to see how it ends up once it is finished.	----->	-8
51107506	Seems Fun.	----->	0
51107849	Alright, I'd say I have enough time on this game to say confidently that I adore this game. It has a super cartoony graphical look, but also slightly more interesting mechanics. I've been playing for about 2 months, and I have learned that you need to be very patient and take your time. I adore this game and it is worth the money.	----->	13

51135246	So, just a little over 24 hours in at this point and I feel that enough time has been given to the game to provide a worthy review.I want to start off with reminding the reader of this review that Foundation is still an early access game and there are still bugs, kinks, and future content/mods to come.The game is beautiful and feels like an artistic expression that nearly comes to life on it's own.  Like most city builders, the general goals and rules are followed.  Start small, satisfy the needs, expand, rezone, rinse and repeat.  However, unlike so many other city builders, the free grid building and path finding citizens are what begin to turn your village into something that practically expresses itself, with you simply guiding it one direction or the other.  Then to add, if you take some time, zoom in a bit, and play around with the decorative structures available, you create this personalized depth to the simplistic village.  It's easy to navigate the controls and learn the interface of the game.  The resource chain and the needs of the citizens aren't particularly large or complex, so it's also fairly easy to learn and use.  Now some of that may have just come off as nonsense, but for me personally, the joy I get from this game is how everything shapes itself without you building every detail grid by grid, like a Sim City.The logistics of the game are both a welcomed and pleasant challenge for sure, however they seem to become basically impossible to manage once you reach a certain population in the game.  There simply just isn't enough food or clothing in the world to satisfy the eventual demand.  You find yourself zoning off over half the land for wheat fields and then your entire shore line is an unsightly mess of fishing docks.  Windmills and bakeries practically require their own village.  The town starts to look like a religious oligarchy with a cathedral on every street corner (unless that's the aesthetic you're going for).  The construction process for the church, manor, and fort are pretty entertaining, but they are lacking quite a bit still.  None of them have a truly wide variety of options and serve little purpose other than aesthetics.  The soldier profession is used in the manor and fort, but they either just stand guard or you send 5 lucky chosen soldiers off to some imaginary aid campaign for some mystery kingdom.  The church only provides a small watering hole for the religiously deprived, hence the necessity to construct so many of them.  None of them provide any type of interface to effect the parameters of the game.  There are also some resources that unfortunately serve no purpose other than trade, such as leather and weapons.  The last thing I'd hope to see some form of, is mortality.  In a few other city builders, death of citizens is a part of the game and it adds an interesting challenge.  Whether it's death from starvation, sickness, or the weather (also a hopeful addition to the game, weather and seasons create an amazing value to city builders).  The citizens have a displayed age, but they do not die, nor are new citizens born.  They only leave when they're unhappy and join the village from an imaginary void.  There are no beginnings or endings in your town, just a revolving door.So, I still highly recommend purchasing this game if you enjoy city builders at all.  The artistically self expressive nature of the game combined with your prerogative as the godly creator, is enough to provide enjoyment and satisfaction.  If you're willing to spend $10.00 to see a movie that lasts 2-3 hours, then spending $30.00 on a game that you can easily enjoy for 9+ hours is worth it.	----->	36
51138182	Brilliant game! I am 20 hours into my first settlement and wow, I am hooked!My only gripe is that when you get to a certain number of villagers gameplay becomes a little repetitive and you lack new things to build, but this is early access and I know there is morecontent to come later on in development.  	----->	-1
51138963	I am really enjoying this game right now, even in the early state that it is in. There are some really novel concepts that make this game very enjoyable. The house building system is left to the citizenry as well as the road building unlike other traditional city builders. There is a lot of room for growth here and being that the devs are very active I can see this becoming a classic.	----->	7
51141224	A great start to what will be, in maybe a few months, an amazing game. There is not a lot of content right now, but even the last update shows that they are working hard on the game and bringing updates quickly.I would personally love to see the game be a little more difficult, like Banished, with harsh winters and maybe raids. Who knows - it's still early access, and is fun to play in its current state.	----->	13

51150643	This is a solid 1v1 MOBA-Lite-ish with two lanes and Blizzard-esque styling. It runs well and is fairly polished for what it is. It's the best game of its kind I've played on Steam, and is memorable enough that I keep circling back to it. As Free-to-Play, you can't beat the price. Microtransactions are present but not constantly in your face. Rounds are conveniently short for those of us with busy lives. Don't expect a full RTS or deep strategy and you'll do fine.	----->	7
51155464	I love it. It is a gorgeous game every village is different. However, it does get a little samey in each zone you collect. Build a well, zone it take the resources. It is in the Alpha stage but Id love to see more domesticated animals, pigs, chickens, cows etc. The villagers are as dumb as and  they are too demanding. You have a church with 2 population but they are demanding a church. and do not get them meat they become a complete pain.I am sure the devs will address these issues and I cannot wait for the finished product	----->	2

51184434	    I enjoy this game. Foundation is all about building your own medieval village/town/city/etc. It's a grid-less game but allows you to paint your own grid where you want your villagers to build things, which in my opinion is at least a semi unique concept to these types of civilization  management games and makes creating your town more interesting. There isn't a lot of challenge or endgame once you get set up though, and that's it's biggest negative I'd say. Plus there isn't a lot to build in the game yet, so combining these two negatives causes boredom to sink in after about 10-15 hours of developing your town(maybe longer for others). But with new updates coming semi-frequently it might grow into a far more interesting game in a few months.	----->	2
51186110	Pro's:Nice looking gameVery relaxing to playSimple enough to learn but definitely hidden depthsPotential for greatnessCon's:The same as everything early access; if you want stonking content, wait for release. It's ok right now as I like to do other things while I play, but I can see some people getting bored	----->	1
51192769	I am hooked.. played a lot of the same type of games but this is very different. The balance is not always ok but in general the developers did an excellent job. The game combines different kind of city builders in one game. Zone`s for extraction , housing , farming etc. The details are beautiful, the sound is great and the building part is easy to learn. Some parts of the game are not easy to understand but google is willing to help .. The pace is not very fast but this is for me the best part, this is not simply click and build but planning is crucial. Some parts need development, soldiers are send out and came back feeling ok. Never lost a soldier, not sure what happened outside the map.For me the best game in 2019 until now, keep up the good work guys !!	----->	19

51224068	This game is wonderful for the first few hours of a playthrough, but lacks complexity to keep you invested in a single city for too long.

51295749	Not as good as GWYF, but still pretty enjoyable at times. If you've got a few extra bucks this is worth it. But if you're deciding between this or another game and it's pretty close... get that other game. Unless it's [i]Surgeon Simulator[\i]. Never get that game. Ever.	----->	7

51339064	This game is a great 1v1 spy vs sniper game with a lot of potential based off of an interesting concept. But with a small yet dedicated player base, it is difficult to find someone to play with unless you join the discord and ask people to play with you. I'm not sure if the game is worth $25 due to the lack of a playerbase, but I'd definitely buy it on sale if you are willing to wait for someone to play with you.	----->	5

The game is serene, and I like the idea of having soldiers to send off to the king's wars, but a local threat would be interesting as well, otherwise the walls are just cosmetic. Maybe down the road. Perhaps the ability to build and deploy city defenses? In any event, a good bit of fun, and I see it going places.	----->	7

51522375	TLDR; What a great little game. Very enjoyable. A chilled out version of Banished and Settlers rolled into one.Even though this is still in Early Access, i haven't seen any game breaking bugs. The trade system is a little confusing/could be more easy to use, a few names of people seem to drop off to generic numbers and a few things are missing names (like textiles) when you hover over them (like tool tips).Game play - think settlers and banished - except WAY easier than banished. Its just a nice little chilled out city builder. I especially like the organic way the residential areas build and upgrade - really nice touch. Plenty of buildings so far to keep you busy.Tech trees - i literally just discovered them after 6hrs play. Hidden in the top menus, there is a bunch more things to open up and build - which opens up more trade.Economy/supply chains. Much the same as any other RTS/builder game. Very similar to banished, without the constant living on the edge of running out of something.Modding/Steam Community DLC is already enabled! So expect to see heaps of additions.Worth a buy in Early Access - i got this one on summer sale. Looking forward to what is yet to come!	----->	11

51596309	At the time of writing this review I have 10 hours in the game and can already tell this is the city builder experience I have always been looking for. I appreciate that there are things missing from the game currently, but if you understand you are getting an early access game I highly recommend. The devs have promised new mechanics and better balancing which will solve the relatively lack luster game play currently present.  In short this game already has me having fun and looking forward to the game's full potential.For those wondering why I recommend the game in this state; I refuse to tank a games rating simply because the devs haven't fully completed the game to final standards. (again, it's early access)	----->	6

51643158	Fun city simulator. And the zoning is a nice change of pace from having to build and site housing myself. The direction the creators are going looks promising.However, it isn't a finished game. And unless you really like building a town, getting everything...and then starting all over, maybe wait a while longer?	----->	5

I see the potential this game has. The dev seems to release updates fairly often and the game seems to constantly improve. If you've ever played a god game or any old school city builder it wont take long to understand the mechanics of this game. 5/5 would buy again!	----->	5

51725880	Like Banished but I think this will have more potential. I'm excited to see how they develop it further. Hope devs make more improvements to the game soon, but still worth the price!Edit 1 : (07-03-2019) -The game is just at a bare bone state with a lot of things left to implement. Tho for it's phase it's quite impressive. The starting could be a bit tough to get gold for your town but in the end game it becomes too easy to do so. Needs work but i could still recommend as its at a playable / non-broken stage.Edit 2 : (16-11-2019) -The recent update has made a lot of changes and i would say the game is now not bare bones anymore, i guess optimisations should be considered a priority now as this games lags for me in high settings. But i am happy to support this game in EA.	----->	11

52040894	Had great fun with this game with a friend, wouldn't recommend so much for general online multiplayer or singleplayer. This game also effectively challenges the player through the power application of the swing by moving the mouse back and forward, whereas rival games (eg Golf with your Friends) uses a more reliable power bar which allows players to just memorise the amount of power required and just putt holes in one each time.	----->	11

52122578	If they keep updating it, I would suspect this being a really great game. But only if, because atm. There’s much to be desires for. What we got, works most of the time. Fishermen walk on water, sign posts are not visible before you place then and there’s some quirks about housing going on. Even though its red and supposed to be not usable for settlement you can build a church or market there and they will still do it. I don’t know if its intended or not, because the help section is lacking severely as well. But its fun, I like the idea of it, and I hope they will expand on the castle idea and sending warriors out top fight. I hope it will be more than just sending NPCs out and after 5 min they come back. I hope more than just a trader wil visit your town, I hope  the church and faith system gets more use than it has atm. In those times, people were generally scared about demons and witches ect. There’s endless possibilities to go for. Atm there’s no harbour or ways to trade in that way, and the warehouse is strange and not really intuitive. Doing the small quests can be annoying as well, because you can have the material they ask for, but can’t hand in the quest because the material is not in your warehouse. What Foundation does new is the housing and building system, kind of like the old Sim Citys, were you mark and area for building and the Npcs will build in that area. In Foundation though that’s not on a strait line but just random places. Again I hope they expand on the system because it’s really fun to see how your city turns out. The happiness system is pretty standard, but again if they expand on it, you don’t know were that will take you.So atm you will have like 5—6 hours of fun, but then there’s not much more too it. And I have a lot of ifs, which is why as with all early access games, don’t expect a finished product, and don’t expect it to be good when its done. Buy it because you like the idea and want to support it.  But its promising and I will keep a close eye on the game.	----->	38

52140447	Fun game to play with friends and somewhat entertaining to play with yourself. Our only problem is the wacky courses can get on your nerves after the novelty has worn off. A close game can be obliterated by abstract course designs. However, we did like the customization offered, such as increased friction and the ability to change putter speed/force. I got this game on sale during the summer for roughly $5 dollars. In my personal opinion, I wouldn't pay more than $10-12. They're adding more apparently, so it might be a solid $15-$20 title IMO soon.	----->	2

52178970	I highly enjoy this game. City builders are my go to most of the time, and the first time I saw this game, it immediately perked my interest. I was skeptical at first, it being an early access game, as these sometimes just die and don't get finished. I decided to give it a chance and glad that I did. The villagers making their own pathing and housing intrigued me, and I like seeing where they go and how they build. For it to be a medieval game was one of the selling points to me. I can't say I've played any game as much as I've played this one, and can't wait for more content to be released. The devs are always helpful on discord and many of the members are more than willing to do what they can to help with problems that people run into. Even with the lack of being a full game as of yet, I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys making villages at their own pace and not having to worry about your village being destroyed because of invaders or of the such. With that said, there is no in game fighting, but you can send military out (off map) to complete a quest for your king and receive reward. With a new UI in the works and soon to have weather, this is a must get for the casual player. Feed your people, fill their needs of religion and clothing and luxuries and you also can have a thriving village/city that will inspire your imagination. The monument system allows you to build buildings different than just placing down a building and it getting built. For example: the church has multiple pieces that can be put together in your liking before hitting the 'build' button. Creations are not all the same, which gives you different experience and a worthy replay value. Thank you Polymorph Gaming for this unique twist and sharing with us all. Keep up the good works and making a bigger better game!	----->	8

52180489	So I got this game a while back because I am a huge fan of strategy and city builder games and I had been watching this game for a while before I bought it. I was nervous because it’s been in early access for a while with not a lot of updates but it was on sale and I knew I was gonna like when it got finished .

52201802	Cheap, and good fun with friends. If you and your friends do not share a lot of common games, the low price is a good incentive to get them to buy it, or even buy it for them so you can play together. I played with a track pad at first and that was a nightmare, but once I used a mouse, the fun would not stop.	----->	15

52260703	Overall a very fun and well thought out game.  While based on classic mechanics of this type, adding modular buildings gives it a more hands on approach.  Most of the mechanics are smooth, and comprehensive to understand.  Getting the balance between the necessary happiness, resources, money, etc. is a balancing act in every game of this type.  There are a few points that the mechanics are not explained, or currently not implemented that can cause issues, such as no tip on how to advance your citizens to a certain tier to progress, or that there is a mechanic in place for citizens being unhappy that they live too far from work, but no way to reassign their living areas, but as the game is still in early access, and the developers are constantly getting feedback from the community and making changes, it should sort itself out at the current trajectory.	----->	3

52278330	Ah yes, balls. I've always loved balls. Since I was a young lad I had an obsession with these spherical objects. I've gone so far as to even try to become one myself. Once my dad took me to play golf and I instantly found my calling. I asked my father if I could access the lou, and I slipped about 7 golf balls into my pocket and headed on my way. I quietly inserted all 7 of those golf balls into my gaping asshole. The feeling of the small divots against my insides was truly invigorating. Golf was never the same for me after that day. I have so many golf balls in my house, and take any chance I can to go golfing with friends or coworkers so I can relive this taboo experience. It was the most erotic when I was at a glow in the dark mini golf establishment. I could do it with almost no one able to see me, right out in the open. I found this game and instantly fell in love. I believe this game should have the tag erotic or sexual themes because every night as I play this game and pleasure myself with golf balls I am filled with pure joy and nostalgia. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys this activity as much as I do.	----->	15
52290193	Picked this game up after watching a bunch of the Yogs play it. The game is quite charming, stylistically and game play wise. But this game is very much in early access. It's very easy to run out of things to do after a while. Being that it is early access there's a lot still to be added. Even as I've been playing there's been more added to the game. If you like these kind of gridless city builders I think you'll like it and if you do you should consider buying it to help the game's development along and come back to it every so often when there's an update.	----->	9

52525762	This is wonderful fun. While you only control where you place units on the battlefield, there's strategy and tactics on various levels.You need to learn the behavior of the units,  any useful combinations of cards and lastly when playing 2v2 coordinate with your partner to play devastating combos.The choice of master matters as well and have interesting synergies with some cards.The game has been improving constantly and you can play for a long time on the free tier before you need to invest anything.Given how much fun I had so far, I have no issue buying their DLCs. After an evening of stressful SC2, this is a very relaxing multi-player game.	----->	13

52827003	Note: I write this review after only making a single course, so it's based on my early discovery of the game.I like the graphics, it have a bit of a N64 or PS2 flavour for the nostalgics and in the same time since all the holes are on the same maps, the scenery is quite detailed.My biggest concern for now is the putter mechanism, having to manage the strenght with the mouse movement... Hard to understand what have the biggest impact between the speed or the lenght that you pull the mouse back before striking.	----->	2

52959665	It's a mini-golf sim; grab friends and talk mad trash on them all. Be careful though, as missing 30+ shots can cause you to stroke out (and I don't just mean in-game). Game is definitely an angry face/10.	----->	-6

52988684	Much like Cities: Skylines, this game offers a relaxing experience that eats away at your time in 4-hour chunks. The medieval setting, the diverse resource management and a custom creator for buildings sets this game apart from Skylines and SimCity. The game feels like a blend of SimCity and Age of Empires, although there is no real form of warfare. The game is a steal at its current price, even though it is an early access title.	----->	1
52991514	fun golf game with plenty of maps to keep you busy. The only troubling thing about this game is sometimes when im in a game i will randomly lose connection to host, which sucks especially if youre doing good. Altogether a good and mellow golf game.	----->	4

53019833	Certainly has a lot of potential, but at the time of writing, still feels much as an early access game. It's by no means bad, but you should be aware that at some point, you'll start getting numbered citizens instead of named. I'd still recommend buying if you enjoy a nice, peaceful citybuilder, and if you want to support the project.	----->	8

53024604	Do you enjoy the sound of your friends raging at sometimes unpredictable game mechanics & straight up troll maps? Then buy this game! It's amazing fun with friends, though group voice chat is ESSENTIAL while you play so you can hear the frustration! There are loads of creative maps to enjoy in the workshop so plenty of replayability. It's a party game night fave here!	----->	15

53041475	Do you have friends? Do you like mini-golf? If you answered yes or no to either of those questions, then this game is for you.  Bring the people you hate most in this world and play this nightmare version of miniature golf, to deepen the rift between you and scream into the ether as you take yet another stroke to sink a seemingly simple shot.	----->	-3

53044273	Looks promising I like the snap-on multipart buildings and can't wait to see what modders do with this game. It could improve a lot on the UI side of things nd large villages are challenging to manage due to too many villagers.	----->	4
53044343	A great base game with some really innovative and neat ideas. My biggest gripes have to do with the UI which is somewhat confusing and always super intuitive. That being said, it is a game that is clearly aiming to become quite complex with many many additions in the pipes so its hard to say what exactly needs to be fixed. I will say that my own city has floundered because my workers stopped working, they would stand by a house then become unhappy that things were not being produced. it was rather confusing. Keep up the good work developers!	----->	6
53045073	Love it	----->	0
53045798	This game is a ton of fun. I find myself constantly going back to it to try out new maps and set-up matches with as many people as i can. I find collision to be a must as the challenge of people bashing into each other really increases the fun and randomness. And there are so many creative map makers making great new content.	----->	6

Love watching the town grow. the stone keep and rustic church really make it interesting that alot of other games need to take notes on because while most of the town grows pretty organically those you get to build yourself and it is tons of fun!	----->	6

53178394	~Asymmetrical competitive 1 vs 1 game.~Very open & kind community, willing to teach new players (and between competitors) all the weird mechanics & rules that spies should follow.~Well thought out venues, mission types & time limit design. The spies have options but staying low the whole game wont win you the game. You can idle to shake off some attention but the time limit is not that generous. You know the creators put effort into testing before releasing, and are willing to listen to community feedback.~Developed community league with numerous divisions for all level of players.~Have potential for further content.	----->	6
53182854	Fun little game to play with friends. Highly recommend using workshop maps as there are only a few courses in the default game.	----->	2

53307131	Overall this is a fun game. Playing with your friends in a 1v1 situation has its moments for sure, however with the early build of this game it tends to lose it's charm quickly and does not feel worth $25 dollars. I feel this game would be better if it's price was reduced to $10. At this point you would get more bang for you buck. If you have the spare change though I recommend it.	----->	13

53382317	First impressions of this gamePositives:- Mouse and Keyboard controls are easy to grasp.- Level creator allows for multiple interesting designs and courses made by the community.- Customisation for your ball  is more than a simple colour change and customisation of your ball being linked to progression in game is rewarding as you sink time into the game.Cons:- Wouldn't recommend using a controller from the limited time I tried it. Manageable if you find it more comfortable but personally, I'd stick with M&K.- 6 courses at launch some say might not be enough however downloading levels made by the community will certainly be more than enough to keep you occupied.	----->	8

53401092	Overall decent game but still has some problems.Really want the devs to keep going and improve things because it has great potentialIssues: Bridge building is very hit and miss you can never be really sure if your bridge will work. Need to have some sort of overlay or color information to show when bridge is built correctly.Builders sometimes take forvever and sometimes build really fast. Not sure how or why this is.Potential Improvements:More options to monitor resources. Never know how much food is needed, only that either I have 1000 berries or everybody is starving. Make it more obvious how much each building produces so we can streamline production lines.Improve water distribution. I feel like I need a well for every two houses to make sure everybody gets enough water. Also applies to bakeries. Need some improved access or maybe better wells/fountains/aqueducts. Better view or how man employees you need to do what. Especially builders and wood and foresters.Revamp the extraction marking system. Maybe be resource? Or by building. Confusing overlay occurs.	----->	10

53615895	I like this game, it still needs work but the core mechanics are there. Tutorial is not not great, discord server can be useful!24/10/2020 Re-review.Recently started this again after many updates. This is a very relaxing game, there is challenge but its slow paced and ramps up gradually. Building up production lines and managing the land to suit your settlement is fun! I hope the devs keep going, it seems to be regular updates so far!	----->	1

53626341	I have played this game for more than 50hrs now. Initially, I liked it but soon got bored as it desperately needs campaigns/scenarios. Until the dev team adds such a thing, the game is truly an early access to what the dev team is working on.What I liked:1) Strategising: you`ll need to keep a check on requirements of the citizen and plan your town to meet them. Bushes = housing area. People = Church.2) Paint the area for resources/housing: unique way and really liked it.3) UI: very intuitive.What I didnt like:1) Objective/Story: No objective defined for town building(yet! The game will become interesting once they add and I hope they add it soon).2) Blocked paths: This occurs when hedges are blocking the path. Hedges are important to improve the land desirability. Houses and Paths are created based on the game engines preference. Managing this is beyond player control.(I am not sure if this has been fixed recently but its very annoying).3) Money: Initially very easy then once you are trying to build bakery, its difficult to come by. Once the bakery production chain is built, it becomes totally useless. You`ll find yourself having more money than the game requires.(This might get fixed as the game evolves.)Requests to Dev team:1) Please add objective/story. 2) An option to auto-reassign all employees to all building based on distance to home. Very difficult once you have expanded to 10+ tiles and have a lot of buildings.3) Whats the point of having soldiers and multiple dozens of them in treasury with no war at sight. Revolt/AI attacks can be added.4) Expand the influence of Anno series for game development to other games such as Pharoah/Zeus.	----->	1
53627388	There are a lot of games out there, but this is the one I always return to.Multiplayer games that use a daily quest system often become tiresome, but here the rewards are plenty and even if sometimes I don't feel like playing I still get enough resources to be able to enjoy the new content whenever it comes out.And when I play just to burn through my quests, the matches are generally fun and quick as long as you don't limit yourself.That's why I recommend it. Because it's fun when you want to play it, and it's also fun when you don't.	----->	21

53786801	Excellent game!  I'm usually a bit weary about purchasing a game before it's 'finished' but there are no regrets here! I love starting over with a new town every time there's an update!The game is a very cutesy town builder.  What it lacks in an oncoming threat - not that I mean this has to be a cute version of AoE3 or something like that, but right now, the guards are pretty much pointless after you've purchased all the land tiles.  It would be nice if they'd add a threat so that the guards, walls, towers, etc. have a purpose rather than just pixel-appeal.It's also be cool if they had different types of guards, like archers, cavalry, etc. so that there can be different types of towers and/or barracks and such.Other than that, I find that the devs are continually working on fixing bugs and resource management so kudos to them!  Overall, it's an excellent game and will be one I come back to every update.	----->	11

As the Spy, the surge of adrenaline while operating under suspicion is, somehow, on par or more to pulse-pounding action/stealth games. And while overlooking the crowd as the Sniper, you are rewarded for both careful analysis as well as behavioral hunches. After all, the game is essentially a reverse Turing test.It is especially a blast to play if you can communicate with who you are playing with, either in person or over voice chat.	----->	4

53947888	So far so good. The UI is messy and needs some updating but once you figure out how to use it in about 30 minutes its okay.  The things your village produces needs a menu so you know what items are what. Devs should add in a list of businesses that display how many employees are working at a specific shop. Those are the only problems I've encountered so far. Not worth the price tag but the game has amazing potential.	----->	4

53969197	This is a great idea for a game, too bad this game frequently crashes. The game has a friendly bug report support system that is if it even works. So to the developer, to give you finally a response my game crashes when I do the final two missions on the tutorial. Everytime I try to submit my bug report it tells me some error has occured and I must go the website and report my bug. So let me get this straight, even your bug report system is buggy and I as the customer must go out of my way to report the issues on your game on which I had to pay full price for? Really? No thanks, I prefer getting a full refund and buying a game that actually works. Oh btw, the game is dead. Max players I have seen on this game is 14. 14/2 = 7 games MAX.	----->	1
53972462	This game is fun to play, fun to master. This game can honestly be seen as the full product as all of the levels you need are mostly created by the community, but if you're looking for the dev made levels they're still very fun to play. That doesn't change the fact that you'll lose your friends tho...	----->	12
53981776	though this game is early access its still pretty decent with the features it currently has. to be honest you can improve your experience with some mods that add extra things that should be added into the game later. such as a way of producing meat. (doesn't exist in base game). There is a road map of the game you can see, it seems very promising.. just be weary of early access games. i don't know this developer that well so buy at your own risk, but its only 30 dollars. i would give it a try, and if you don't like it then refund it.	----->	5

54018894	The game is coming along nicely. I would like more to do with churches. The emissary needs some balance when it comes to which resources he asks for in the early game (how can I get fish on a hills map before I can even trade?!). The game gets really easy once you get food production stabilized, though. Maybe some late game barbarian attacks on your keep or something? Soldiers are worse than useless as it stands.	----->	-3
54019426	Relaxing building game that's easy to learn and fun to master. Reminds me alot of Anno 1404, altough Foundation seems to let you get more creative with your building projects than 1404 did. There's very few bugs in the game, but also alot of work that needs to be done before the game reaches full potential.	----->	8
54021115	Foundation is a beautiful, free-form, medieval city builder that is relaxing and helps inspire creativity. The assets are very attractive, and the feel of the game is nostalgic yet modern. One feature I like best is not being restricted to a grid system. This gives a lot of freedom and reduces the amount of pre-planning necessary - which is welcome as I prefer a more fluid gameplay system. I have a lot of hope for the future of this game, as it is Early Access, since the developers are active in posting content and devlogs. Very excited for what's to come!	----->	19
54034590	This game is fun. It's addictive - one of those games where you think 'Oh I'll just do this quickly before I head off' and suddenly another 45 mins has passed. It takes a while to get into it properly (I think I opened and closed it about 3-4 times within the first hour of game time). After a swift google on how to do a couple of things in order to complete quests and get a village up and running with trade, i was away. Suddenly 7 hours had gone. My advice would be use google early on if you have any trouble setting up the Market / Trade routes etc. The UI is lacking and the help, although better than nothing, isn't clear. This game has a lot of potential if they continue to listen to player feedback and actually complete the list of updates they've already confirmed they're doing. I don't tend to buy Early Access games. I bought 1 a few years back (Folktale) and it just died mid-production. I'm glad i bought this game - I think it could be great.	----->	2
54041215	Well 76H playtime and its still in Alpha. I would love if u would enable Nvidia Ansel function and also more buildings.Like mead brewery and a tavern/bar. I miss custom player maps for a more variation in the game, but as mentioned. Alpha.. A time killer. Fun as hell	----->	-3
54044466	Its a great game but it dosent have a sandbox mode yet and it still dosent have a ton of content but its still REALLY FUN!	----->	3
54046569	Simple, fun game. Haven't gotten into course creation. It's my GO TO after drinking a bit. Some people, like Winrawr and zheno, are rude, but if you don't get in a game with them, you'll have fun. Hey guys!	----->	6
54055742	cool	----->	1
54058178	I recommend this game because it is fun, but at this moment there is not enough content in the game to justify full price. The FOUNDATION is set (pun intended), just need to build on it!(Some sort of risk, IE: bandit raids or competition to rule the map would be nice. I'm a fan of serving a king from the start but other than farming splendor from the king, church, people ETC there isn't much point to be in service of the king. Maybe once your  kingdom reaches a certain size you can separate yourself from the king's service?)Buy it on sale if you want your money's worth, buy it full price if you want to support the developers. I bought it at full price... I think.	----->	11
54060488	I'm really enjoying myself with this game, it has a fresh feeling, nothing too serious like other city builders more strategy and planning focused. It reminds me of the Anno games in a way but different. The only thing, that I can think of now, that would make for a better experience is if the maps were procedurely generated, so that starting a new city would always feel different even if choosing the same raw land. For example: I really like Fluvial because it feel the most diverse while simple, while the lack of water in Hills make for a more dull environment, Coast and Valley feel a little bland as of now IMO, and Mountain terrain is just too rough for me, so I tend to choose Fluvial. If maps were procedurely generated I might try different options, or at least get different versions of the same layout. I state this because it's early access and maybe it might help the improve the experience for everyone.Other than this I really like were this is going	----->	11

54120431	Great build game, no set time and no rush so can let run for 5 and do something else while resource build's, get busy again building structure, sell some thing's, buy some thing's, build resource, build structure, sell some thing's, buy some thing's and so on and so on, zero pressure to do anything much, be mindful of resource and the amount of warehouse.Super fun to wind out after a day. Looking forward to progress, still the odd text name bug and U.I. is a little tricky but makes me think age of empires.Deffinitly one worth watching if not willing to pay, if you like sim city, transport fever or any city sim builder, give it a try, quite good.	----->	3

54199914	If you're into city-builders and like a game that keeps you working, then this is the game for you. Foundation does a good job at keeping you busy as you expand your city to your permanent goal. The game itself runs smoothly, and the art style is calm and detailed. The game's economic and trade-system keep the experience challenging, yet fun as well. Keep in mind this game is in early Alpha; therefore, there will be certain bugs (like some people getting stuck and names of citizens and cities not rendering). If I were to add anything to the game in future development, I would most definitely add some type of military combat in the game. The fulfillment of a good looking military camp accompanied with a large keep is nice, yet I would like to call on furthermore expansion in that area. The game can become somewhat addicting as you progress on to a larger settlement. I would definitely recommend this game to the gamer's who enjoy city-builders. It stands up to the game-category quite efficiently.	----->	21

54215225	I've played around 30 hours so far, so its time for a review. Overall the experience has been very good, I'm not usually a fan of city builders but this one has a unique style that I really enjoy. Pros:- Organic expansion- Great art-style- Customisable structures- grid-less- building work well- Lots of building freedom, lets you place small details- ModdingCons:- Some features are a bit clunky, such as warehouses and worker housing.- Some features are still buggy- Limited number of maps (for now) lessens replayability- Maps have visible edges- Balancing issues (land taxes for example).There are a few big issues that I have with the game but once these are fixed (fixes are planned) the game will be solid. Overall its a fun experience even with the problems. I think the price might be a bit high for its current state, although it does give you value. As the game progresses I can see it becoming very replayable and having a lot more to do. I'd recommend buying it if you're into creative building games, city builders etc. In its current states there's still a good amount to do and you'll probably get good value from your money.	----->	18
54216449	Hey that's pretty good!	----->	1
54216631	It is really really good. The organic paths and the fact you can design your own buildings is really neat. I love it.	----->	3
54224106	very fun simple mechanics game	----->	4
54229457	I was really hyped to buy this game, however after playing it for a little bit, I am not sure if I am enjoying it that much. It definitely lacks players and its price point is quite steep for its genre . :(	----->	2
54246837	Love everything that this game is made of. Though the price is a tad bit high for what i would consider worth buying.  However, every second of this player v player manhunt is beyond fun.I think the price is what lurks a lot of people away, and it's hard to convince my friends to even give it a try with the price alone.	----->	1
54257509	one of the best games in the steam store in my opinion 10/10	----->	3
54289974	Игра хорошая. Если не смущает цена, смело берите.Однако лучше купите ещё и другу, потому что комьюнити по большей части англоязычное и найти кого то в лобби в московском часовом поясе практически невозможно.Несколько вечеров с друзьями точно пройдут с ней весело, советую.	----->	0
54291012	PROSVery fun, simple game. Workshop has some amazing maps.Community is awesome and easy to make friends.There's almost always a random lobby to join.CONSNot as fun if you play alone.	----->	11
54310930	This game is quite fun and has a lot of potential. I've played 30h (some afk) and think i've unlocked everything with 476 villagers. Not much of an endgame so far but getting there was enjoyable, keeping those peasants happy.The resource management needs to be a bit more sophisticated, i get blacksmiths going from one side of the map to the other for coal instead of waiting for the coal hut next to him :')Overall, i'm happy with my purchase so far!	----->	7
54316219	I'm really enjoying this title more than I was expecting. The map editor clearly offers a lot of freedom to map makers, there is a lot of creativity in the custom maps I've played online with friends so far. The Steam Workshop really helps elevate this game to a higher level. The devs offer a fair amount of alternatives and input sensitivity sliders for putting too.+ Good choice in game engine for custom user-made content, gives the game long legs.+ Decent physics and control options+ Haven't had problems with connecting to friends or hosting rooms.+ Can adjust tick-rate+ Some gameplay modifiers, would like to see more.- Overall bland music- Built in maps are forgettable.- Clunky menus	----->	9
54329622	Great game, only downside is you lose friends.	----->	-2
54341235	It is a great variation of supercells battle royale. It's good to have a differend kind of a game on the same genre. Game is not buggy sometimes mid-battle game slows just a litte but it could be my gpu too.Game is a bit hard to master & learn - discover cards required which could be proccessed though playing so keep on playing give it a chance od not abandon it quick ^^	----->	6
54346316	Great game over all, but some of the physics need improvement. Would recommend this game for a group of friends that just wanna kill some time.	----->	-1
54347702	I am not normally one that purchases early access games.I am a fan of city building games, and this one has provided me quite a bit of fun. Of course, the game is not without its flaws, and because it is an early access game - I am hoping a lot of the kinks will get ironed out over time.As of right now, I would not jump into this game expecting any kind of challenge and rather just a laid back experience - appreciating the art style. In my playthroughs I was able to build and unlock all items the game currently has fairly quickly. The common issues I ran into was that villagers would get stuck frequently doing tasks, and soldiers would sometimes get lost outside the map. Looking through my town for the cause of some of these issues it seems that because you paint residential zones and villagers build withing the painted zones as they see fit they can build far to close to one another in “high desirability” areas  ; ie. places that are close to markets, wells, churches. I couldn’t find a reason as to why the soldiers were getting lost off map. Many people already mentioned ugly UI but according to the roadmap there are plans to change that. This will be a game to keep an eye out for, I will definitely jump back into it once there's another big update. As of right now it just doesn’t provide enough content for me to really sink my teeth in for long periods of time. If you’re the type of person that’s cool with a work in progress game, and wants to support the team behind it. I would recommend this title.	----->	6
54349853	Great game even when it is on early access still a little things need to be improved but overall great game	----->	5
54364868	One of the most fun games to play TOGETHER witth friends.Alone its okay but with friends its very fun!	----->	4
54381844	A game for you to rage at and with your friends. Far more fun with friends.	----->	2
54383247	Very cute and fun game. Takes some practice to get things down but once that's over with, the creativity one can achieve is amazing so far. Excited to see future updates.	----->	10
54384110	Highly recommended please keep updating. Hopefully this one could have more mods and develop higher classes for the characters. Couldn't find any other nice city build game to play since Banished was left unfinished. Also please use the right profile pictures cuz villagers look hundreds of years older in the pics.	----->	7

54407357	Great game!! It is a little expensive but that is ok. I really want to be able to shoot anything when safety is off. For example being able to shoot out windows. Etc.. It could help to see how the other player reacts.	----->	2
54409661	I first played this when it was a Humble Original and I found myself playing for a half hour then being frustrated with the experience when I hit the boss and suddenly there seemed to be no practical route would ensure victory and an ever present time pressure discouraging experimentation. The few Youtube videos of the game also never got past that point. I'm not even sure, at that stage, if there was more to the game at that time. Thankfully reinstalling it now the game has come on leaps and bounds with a much more reasonable difficulty curve, plenty of content, and the removal of that time pressure (which some players may dislike, but for those purely in it for the puzzle aspect being able to take your time is a massive boon). It also has the ability to quit at and time and resume which is a rarity in rogue-lites. Exploitable I suppose, but a nice convenience feature. The graphics and sound are both nice with a fun laidback theme. A few secrets hidden about as well as some optional 'minigames'. Recommended!	----->	8
54434038	i cant believe i lost more friends playing this then monopoly	----->	-3
54440104	(Update: I finally figured out the right steps to unlock the warehouse, an oversight on my part.) Really enjoying the zen city building, looking forward to seeing how it develops.	----->	2
54445715	So far I cannot wait for full versions of the game. I hope there will be a lot of modular building with a lot f assets :)	----->	4
54452622	Perhaps the most charming and clever city-builder I've yet played. It's medieval themed, if you couldn't tell, but does a lot of things uniquely compared to others.[list][*]First of all, there's no grid and annoying 90 degree limitations as in many other games of this genre.[*]Zoning of residential areas is also free-form, not conforming to roads like in modern city builders.[*]The villagers will make their own paths along frequently traveled routes which is a very nice and organic feature. However, you can set zones of exclusion up so they don't trod through your favorite park, etc.[*]Monuments and special buildings can be modularly built, similar to one of Sim City 5/2013's only redeeming features.[/list]I may add on to this list later. All in all a heavily recommended game!!!	----->	10
54453031	Picked it up couple months ago, fun minigolf game, easy to pick up and play with your friends.Developers are active and keep making the game more interesting.	----->	6
54454748	I love the game but it's hard. I always lose all my gold and go to like -2000 gold. I wish that there would be some kind of sandbox mode. I would love to play the game more but I always end up closing it because it's so stressful.	----->	11
54459307	Such an amazing game. Really encourages people to get creative with some tracks. :D	----->	8
54471268	Brilliant game.Nothing more can be said about this fun, relaxed building game. I have had this game for a while but didn't really get into it and now only just recently have I started ranking in some hours when I felt confident to actually learn and experience how the game works. Food can be somewhat of an issue but after some time I quickly learned how to balance that out and everything since then has been smooth sailing. I have expanded my land across three tiles and everything is going great! The graphics are pleasant to look at, there's nothing too tedious to take note on and its just an over all fun game to play when you want to kick your legs up and relax from playing a sweaty round of PUBG or Left 4 Dead 2. The music in the game helps but I prefer to be listening to my own music which adds to the experience. I also love the fact that the developers keep updating the game and haven't abandoned it yet - but with that price tag, I am not surprised they are sticking with it.I recommend that you buy this game and enjoy it. There are plenty of videos on YouTube covering this game so why not look at those while you're at it if you are torn between getting the game or not. I mean, it's understandable since the hefty price tag that comes along with this game as mentioned before. But get it. You won't regret it!!	----->	15

54502229	I have put a chunk of time into the game and have started over quite a few time as a result of learning what i did wrong each time as far a a town lay out.  I really enjoy the game so far.  In every game however around week 150 all of my villagers start to pause for a second or two before they complete their tasks.  This bug cuts my production in half.  I have had upwards of 250 villagers and as low as 150 at the stated time but it always seems to happen which makes the entire village go to poop.  At this time after that time in the game it is un playable.  I know it is early access so i am sure it will get fixed at some point.  as far as the game play before that point its awesome.  I look forward to the complete game and bug fixes.  Cant wait to play this past week 150.	----->	-1

54521048	Fajna gra ale zdecydowanie nie w moim stylu. Za dużo puzzli i za mocna randomizacja wrogów i przedmiotów na poziomach sprawia, że czasami dany poziom jest prosty a czasami niemożliwy do ukończenia więc ostatecznie ukończenie gry polega na tym czy ma się farta w tym jak poziomy będą się losować.	----->	0

54529117	Haven't played it in a while but I grabbed it when it first released. It's a lot of fun, but I do think it's a bit overpriced. Definitely worth picking up on a sale at the very least.	----->	2
54542395	Such a wonderful strategy game, truly focused on resource management above other elements common with similar types of games. Enjoyable in Early Access and even more so with each new update building on the foundations (ha) of an already solid game. Beginner Tip: Don't be afraid to turn off Immigration every now and then to slow things down and focus on your existing citizens needs!There is a good amount of balance between allowing the player to design their medieval town as well as organic creation via residential zones and the citizens themselves. The recent update has added some much appreciated radius indicators on key items which makes town planning and managing happiness even easier.This is a relaxing strategy game. The music is peaceful and slips into the background as you concentrate at times instead of grating on your nerves with repetition. Trading, Citizen Happiness & Economy are all implemented in an easy to learn way without removing the challenges that make the game enjoyable. Looking forward to future updates and seeing what else Foundation has in store!	----->	16

54625143	This is a good medieval city builder. Since its still in the alpha build, I hope for further improvements in the future. For instance, population stagnates at 300 in my city because people are not getting their needs satisfied due to the AI being unable to live near its workplace. It specifically chooses the next available house space not considering the location of their occupation. I have people walking to a farm 300m away from house, church and market, then they complain about their lack of needs. Maybe add a transportation building(carriages or horses) which lets the people cut their walking time? Also, I cant delete the walls for some reason. It doesn't have a demolish button. Hoping for improvements in this specific areas.	----->	2
54635423	[b]My favourite game.[/b]Easy to pick up, lots of possibilities to design your deck, not microtransaction-dependent,and very fun to play alone or with friends.Only con that newly introduced cards or masters can be unbalanced at first.9/10	----->	2

54651696	I found this game really fun to play and fairly interesting and complete for an early access game. I wish they would add more maps and larger maps (kind of like Banished) as well as more info about the villagers would be interesting. Maybe more story lines. I am really interested in seeing this game develop and think it could be a great standalone game.	----->	14
54653207	I've spent quite a lot on this game because its a bit overpriced, but besides that, its the most intense and funny game i've ever played, I even recorded some videos for my friends to see. I'd recommend to everyone I know if it wasn't so expensive.	----->	7
54656474	Love it, although is clearly still a work in process I hope we'll get to see some new features for replaying the game.

54742305	Love the game, just think it needs a discount in order to make it more shareable. the price point is higher than most are willing to go, i honestly had to bite the bullet and just purchase copies for my friends. They both really like the game, but the price just doesnt cover the lack of other people to play with among other unfinished parts of the game. I still enjoy it and play it regularly, but only because i have some one IRL i know will be one to play. the 1 server has like, 14 players on avg and the skill curve is a cliff against those guys. This would be a PERFECT switch game at 15 or 20 bucks, but it's a hard sell at 25 when it's not finished. Being a small game is fine, but like at least give your characters names. it's been years.	----->	3
54742661	可玩性越来越不错了，虽然还有很多待完善的地方，不过现在最大的问题是后期无事可做，整个节奏比较慢，没有生存压力，后期更是只能看风景了。不知道制作组会不会出战斗系统~.~b	----->	0
54757418	It is AMAZING! The graphics run great on my AMD video card, which says a lot. I've played for about 29.5 hrs and am still loving it. Yes, it is early access and with that fact says a lot about the devs and the game currently. The community moderators offer a lot of help with questions and are quick to respond. There is no current steam mod support but they have a roadmap (https://trello.com/b/i5AX944p/foundation-roadmap) and mods https://foundation.mod.io/.Like I said, AMAZING! I do recommend picking this up in its current form. There is a lot to enjoy right now.Edit: There is mods now	----->	12

54776423	This is a brilliant game. It is beautiful, fun, and I have not had any problems with the mechanics. I haven't been able to stop playing it. I am looking forward to what will be added overtime as it moves out of Early Access and towards release.	----->	1
54783317	Foundation is a fun, highly enjoyable game. Although it lacks content and contains a few bugs here and there, Foundation as an early game has proved to be quite the city simulator. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city simulations set in the medieval time period.	----->	4
54792331	The game is in the current state not worth more than 5-10 Euros. But the idea looks promising.+ gameplay is fun~ current play time- overpriced	----->	2
54794412	It is a very good game but not at its current state. After building a monastery, there wasn't much else to do in the game. As you never see other cities in the game, and the trading options are limited to 3 cities, and there is no ship building, the game gets boring in 5 or 6 hours of gameplay.Buy it when its not early access.	----->	-2

54803694	Wait for release (less bugs better balance) or for it to be on sale, not worth full price.Pros- -Great art style-Game isn't grid based and villagers make their own paths making for a really unique and natural feel. Probably best part of the game.-Decent TutorialCons- -UI still unfinished-Moving villagers between jobs is clunky, would be better off using a system like banished or forest village.Some bugs like villagers getting stuck.-Not a fan of the radius of the church, needs to be increased.	----->	17
54808369	Was alot more fun than I expected it would be.GREAT with friends.Course editor for people who wanna go architect on it.Great imagination and light gameplay make for a fun experience for all ages.Highly family friendly.	----->	8
54809511	Good Game. Also since its an early access i understand that there is a bit of need to improve it. It has a feeling of playing Anno although with no ships. Also would recommend that building Lumber camp does not require tools as player will get stuck easily if they don't pay attention. Or if that cannot be done at least add some alternative way to get tools like on Anno where you can buy it.	----->	3

54817145	When I was 15 my gaming addiction began with settlers.(the original).Somehow this feels like the (nearly)30 yrs later enhanced and expanded version.Definately equally addictive,if not more so, and finally getting it right.However,there's still a lot of work to be done but with time,I'm convinced this game and these devs can give us even better.Early access equals incomplete systems however, and where I'm quite familiar with coding irregularities, it might be confusing for some.Well worth it,though!	----->	3

54925245	I love how natural the city growth feels in this game. Instead of building roads, they appear where your citizens walk the most and they're really good at finding best routes. The city you build doesn't look generic like in other city building games. In most games a building can be built in 1-4 directions. Here you have a full 360 degree range. The result is a beautiful looking city. Nothing is built in a straight line unless you deliberately chose so. Careful when you click to build though. When you place your building with the left mouse button, the building won't appear. So immediate reaction is to click again and then you realize you have two or more of the same building being built on top of each other :)) Other than that, the gameplay is perfect.I'd only ask adding day/night cycle and having the city illuminated by torches, fireplaces and glowing windows at nigh, that would really bring atmosphere to this game.	----->	20

55056620	Early Access Game, it is getting long in the tooth to still claim to be an 'Early Access Game'. Still with that said for the price it works/plays well.  Easy to play without being boring. Play with someone and enjoy the freedom to pick the type of game and play style that suits you. Runs and has no major bugs, better than some other recent AAA games :-).	----->	5
55061601	Foundation is a beautiful game, being gridless, cities look very naturally grown and cosy. It takes a couple of minutes to get the basic mechanics of the game, but then it’s (rather) intuitive and very fun. The game in alpha so there is still a lot to be done an improved, but that also makes updates so much more rewarding, because the add a lot to the game.	----->	3

55116996	The game has a really nice style and as a city-builder it shows a lot of promise. The zoning system (for housing, forestry and crops) is a neat feature which sets it aside from similar games in the genre. I like that it gives the player the freedom to plan their town without having to focus on every single citizen's home. A real Lord isn't going to trouble himself with those kind of minor details, so the villagers are be left to get on with it, but only on the land you designate for housing. You still of course get to place all other buildings, and because you're painting the zones in any random shape you like, the town manages to escape that 'tiled' appearance that many other games in the genre can suffer from.Bear in mind however, this is an early access game, and it does require some fleshing out by the devs to maintain interest beyond that 10-12 hour mark. While I've yet to hear of any official development road map, one feature I'd put on my wishlist is enemy raids, to provide a purpose for your military garrison other than occasionally sending them off on missions for the King. Would also be nice if there were coastal/river maps and shipping trade, but maybe that's my fondness for traditional strategy/trade games like AoE and the Anno series coming into play.One complaint, I feel the devs are charging quite a lot for this game considering it is still early access. In it's current state it may only keep you interested long enough to decide whether it's a keeper or refunder. I decided quite early for me that it is a keeper however, mainly because I am having fun building up my little town, and on the fact that the devs are responding positively to player suggestions/criticisms. There have already been some major updates just in the last couple of months since I started playing, and the devs seem to be keeping the pace.	----->	18
55130732	I think this game is superb at the moment but that doesn't mean stuff cant be improved, but let me get into the pros1. I think general art style of the game is amazing and they did a great job on making a cartoonish medieval city builder..2. Zone is easy to use and learn 3. The custom buildings are sweet 4. generally a easy to play fun relaxing gameNow its time for the cons, must of these are just going to be a product of the fact that this game is in its early stages but still:1. Soldiers and Castle don't Really have a use 2. Modding isn't done through steam3. Notifications are sometimes hard to spot 4. Lack of different homes can make villages like very bland 5. Sometimes get in a loop where you simply can't recoverIn my Opinion this game is awesome, I also would say that the pros out weight the cons but just keep cons in mind well playing and you should be fine.	----->	21
55142026	I just got this game a couple of days ago and have to say, that I really enjoy it and would recommend it to everybody, who is into city building games like banished or the likes. It took me quite a while to understand how the game works, because since it's an early access title, there is no tutorial yet. But if you are able use google, you will quickly find anything you need to know provided by the community.What I really like about this game, is how it looks and feels. I spend about half an hour just watching my villagers wander the streets, working, going home or to the market. The landscape and buildings are quite beautiful and the different kinds of maps make you adapt to the landscape as well. The graphic style supports this all very well.That being said, there is still a lot of work to be done. Since the distances between workplace, home and market are quite important, some options regarding an automatic redistribution, even if it would be triggered manually and with a short term loss of happiness should be implemented. A tutorial is also needed, this goes without saying. And on a personal note, i would like to see more buildings, more goods, more jobs, more options for trading, more quests, maybe a short campaign mode and more customizable parts for the monuments in the game. Anyway I'm quite hopeful that this game becomes something more than it is right now and the developers seem to be dedicated to deliver a product which is worth its money.	----->	20

What a breath of fresh air this game delivers. We need more games like this. You can get very creative with this game , has a high replay value , and is very fun to play. For early access , well even if they didnt add more content , as of now it is very good with just a few small bugs ive noticed. Having said that cant wait for more content! The sound is very good! I'm impressed with it. Please Polymorph games , make more games like this! We gamers need and crave them. God bless the founder and creator of this game. Enjoy Playing Foundation Everyone. I reccomend this game highly. I give it a 9.2 out of 10! Solid game with very high replay value as i stated before. Thankyou PolyMorph Games!	----->	23

55269039	Old Review:Pathing errors, galore. Gridless building is a gimmick, organic zoning results in houses inaccessible to residents. Distance traveled by workers seems small, but is traveled so slowly to make the economy totally inefficent. If I can't control the location of residents, then how can distance between housing and jobs be relevant.Lots of bugs... sometimes jobs just stop getting worked at all, with no explanation until a new map is started.Can't recommend in it's current state... reading the priorities of upcoming update suggest it will get worse before it gets better.10/17 Pathing issues persist. Zoning  / gridless issues appear worse than previous. to keep budgets reasonable we must have better control over housing locations. See how bad it can get here:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1892076294This is an extreme example but a valid one.1/15/2020Zoning issues persist. Problem is magnified now that housing is required for happiness.1/30/2020Issues with empty housing space persists. Per earlier updates housing just doesn't occupy spaces that are large enough for it.7/16/20201.6 Updated review:I like the way this game is going, but the housing zoning is still acting super wonky. Housing doesn't fill out properly. few buildings are built in space provided, high desirability land is left empty. It's just weird.Splendor value of Lord Manor building parts needs to be increased or re-balanced. Church capacity seems low building size.More than anything playing the game makes me wish for plop-able housing like other games of the genre. I realize that the 'killer feature' of this game is the 'organic' housing, but it still isn't working right after extensive development time.I'm changing this to positive. Some real improvements have been made and the multi-part buildings are really great.	----->	1

55286002	New games and already 22$.. unless you invite your friends, you have nobody to play with, matchmaking is DEAD, there's literally like 5 people online. This game should be free or 5 bucks at most until it reaches players. Refunded.	----->	5
55294461	Really nice game with, I think, a lot of potential. What I especially like is the organic growth of your city, the paths that are created by your citizen, the houses that you do not need to place yourself, it really brings life to your city + I find the artstyle really nice and fitting. I think I am going to spend a lot of time in this game! Can't wait to see more features being added in the future! I will update this review after I play a few more hours.	----->	10

55381741	[b] It's a very slow-paced and easy city building simulation. It's everything the Settlers should have been! [/b]I've come back to this game after some time and it has changed a lot. As you can see my game-time has gone way up since then. The devs have definitely been working and improving the game. Now, you have a lot of new production chains, new military missions and buildings, which also have new functions. You can earn blueprints and research them, allowing you to unlock new buildings and customize your town even further. Since the Settlers flopped big time, this is the game you want to play instead!I recommend the game.	----->	7

55530706	I do recommend playing this game. It's a different and unique approach to city builders. However, it's not worth its money yet. There are too many bugs and not enough to do. Since it's an early access version I'd wait for the full release or a sale before buying.	----->	4
55530921	Foundation to me is a great void filler. Updates are pretty steadyInteresting maps each with their pros and consGood assortment of buildings with the addition of in game created assetsMaking a city has a unique feel compared to other builders. Steady updates with noticeable improvements and or additionsSome bugs, to be expected,  but the good far outweigh the bad in anything that I have seen so far.I like it. Keep it up!	----->	6
55553894	This game has a huge amount of potential.The game as of right now may not quite be worth $30 but, based on my first impressions, it could be in the future.The game is completely gridless except for territory boundaries. You get to freely choose where buildings are set up without being restricted to a grid system, leading to organic looking cities. On top of that, you can set a residential area however big you want and your peasants will automatically place and build houses within that area, as well as automatically paint roads along common paths that they take.All this results in a believable looking city.The monument system is a good system now that, with more variety, could become great. The system as of now, already allows for lots of control in how a church, keep, or manor is constructed. How you construct them will impact the overall splendor score, building cost, and functional effectiveness of said monument. Example: Adding extentions to a church will be more expensive but, will allow for more peasants to regularly attend it.The cons for the game are as follows: - Lack of variety in monument building. - Cannot upgrade certain pathways to stone. - The wall system is terrible. You are literally restricting mobility for no functional benefit. Not to mention you cant add towers, except for building tons of keeps.  - Early game feels a little cramped given the high cost to expand your territory. - Decorative bushes are so easy to spam and get a positive score for a residential space. So functionally, not a whole lot of viable variety in decoration. In my opinion, the more expensive it is, the more effective it should be and the Decor bush is the cheapest thing in the game.Overall, I love this game and I'm rooting for it's success. It could lead to new ideas for medieval city builders in the future.	----->	14

55606497	Ive grown wary of 'early access' games and giving the trust that they'll improve, as a significant amount of them seem to be eternally stuck in that mode and rarely update, even if there's a small team or one person, I expect some level of responsiveness.Thankfully, Foundation breaks that expectation, and since I purchased the game has gone through several significant updates.The simple fact that the villagers forge their own paths and I dont have to ocd over a perfect grid makes this game worth it as a sim. Being able to 'paint' your zones for gathering and residental and the like make it a lot more organic and in the lines of what you'd imagine a village of the time period would do (and basically did, there's a reason the oldest cities in the world are a spaghetti maze of roads and alleys and weird shaped buildings!) and it makes for it being interesting to just sit back and watch your village do its thing. I actually enjoy tacking the camera on a person and seeing what they do for a day, the different zoom levels make this even more interesting. Being 'early access' there's not really an endgame, and Ive reached points where there wasnt really anything further to do, so that required a new start on a new map, and at first the camera controls werent obvious so I actually didnt go onto the mountain maps because camera kept going into the ground! But that was my bad and a bit of a lack of instruction, but plenty of time for that to get some more polish, and I've no reason to think they wont, with how good they've been about updating and adding new features. For once this is an early access ride Im happy to be on, and look forward to continuing until it's finished and playing along then!	----->	11
55620471	A beautiful game in which your village and town grow so naturally I wonder if it even is a game. While obviously not finsihed and lacking in some areas. I can't recommend it enough and it has grown on me as a game I'll always have installed on my PC.	----->	5

55640181	For lovers of community management & strategy games, I've been playing this genre since knights & merchants and settlers era and I loved Foundation. I had the same feeling with new graphics and well executed region planning as well as peacefull gameplay. Compared to Banished this is more easy to play. I believe they will come out with great executions to solve the issues that are part of early access game.	----->	9

55679925	Excellent game! I had issues at first with citizens getting stuck in sockets, but that was my own fault for not paying attention to the green arrows on the buildings. Dev response below helped me get that fixed, so thank you for that! Highly recommend the game!!	----->	2
55681558	this game is right up my alley. Really enjoying it so far.  Not bad for early access.  its not perfect though and here are my suggestions for future updates: - more detailed economies - health and health events e.g. plagues - apothecaries - education and building upgrades - i dont know who can play it on 1 speed but it defs needs at least one more faster speed - modern water graphics - its pretty early 2000s looking atm - click on a building should highlight others of the same type and give radius of affect - something to struggle against, invasions, press gangs, anything!overall, so far a pretty good but light medieval sim village	----->	7
55683069	Definitivamente un desafío, aún siendo fácil de entender por más que vaya directo a la acción. Me sorprendió lo mucho que entretiene, volver a  empezar una partida una y otra vez sabiendo que podés hacerlo mejor. La ansiedad e impaciencia son el verdadero enemigo en este juego, si morís es por no ponerte a pensar un rato como resolver el púzzle de cada calabozo. Muchos niveles maquiavélicos para inspeccionar incitándote a terminarlos al 100%, divertidos personajes caninos con habilidades distintivas, entre estos, un protagonista del cual te hace encariñar. El genial estilo de música que sabe cuando cambiar de ritmo para intensificar la situación. El arte pixel está tan bien mostrado en los enemigos y demás detalles del entorno. Varios modos de juego y niveles por destrabar que hacen de Fidel un juego muy entretenido y que vas a seguir jugando como a su vez construyéndolo. Maravilloso lo que hicieron estos desarrolladores, demuestran un alto potencial. A relajarse y usar mucho la cabeza para lograr el mejor resultado.	----->	2

55700534	Great game, although very pricey for being Early Access. Foundation is a very fresh and needed take on city building, as this genre seems to have been really undeveloped during the last 10 years. I love how it doesn't make the game about war and strategy as a pure city managing experience is exactly what I have been craving for a long time.It goes without saying that there are still adjustments to be made in its current state, but devs seem very active and engaged on Reddit (r/foundationgame) and are willing to explain features and talk about planned features aswell. I really hope this isn't gonna end up as a classic Early Access experience where the game stops development after the paycheck has been cashed, as it so enjoyable and really deserves all the attention it can get from devs.	----->	4

55924070	This is the only Early Access game I've ever bought. It came up as a steam recommendation since I love Cities I assume. I love it. It doesn't feel early access at all except for when your soldiers are off fighting at [Img]. The game play is easy enough to figure out and comes to you in unlockable pieces that are acquired as you build your town.  I like the hexagonal territories that you unlock since it helps with the organic flow of the town, since the citizens decided where to build their homes, and the paths they take to all the other d. With no roads to build you need to be mindful of where you plan to expand to, but elevation isn't an issue since the building adapts to uneven terrain! The supply chains and trade are very simply laid out and also easy to use.  The game itself isn't overly easy as any city builder can be ruined with a lack of food or poor planning. It's super fun to custom create a few special buildings and I look forward to even more building customization, including homes or upgrading. Its relaxing and you can accidentally drop a few hours in at a time. If you like any city builders, you'll like this.	----->	15

55985101	As a city builder fan, I like to hold such games to high standards. This game did not disappoint. The game feels more natural than any city builder I've played before. The paths are organic and makes it feel more realistic. That said, the UI needs a lot of work. It's still in early access, so I suspect it'll be worked on. The game is not as intuitive as it could be, but after a few hours I got the hang of it.	----->	2

56018632	Yes, it is very simple at the moment. Yes, the content is very streamlined. But gosh, is it fun to build with the monumental system and with the organic growth of the town. The implementation is simple and has a lot of ground to evolve but the potential of this little game is immense. Please for the love of Foundation, continue the development and bring this Gem off from early access.Keep up the good work, and I'm by no means disappointed with the product as is.	----->	9

56092981	I just bought it on a whim about 1.5 years ago and haven't really stopped since. At first glance it seems like a simple game, shoot the spy, or don't get shot as the spy... how hard can it be? Then you play it for a while and realize that there is so much depth and you never stop learning and improving. That fact, along with this being by far the best gaming community I've ever experienced as well a a really fun and active competitive scene definitely makes this my favorite game of all time.	----->	10

56172108	Wonderfully relaxing City Builder.. Still obviously in EA but in my opinion it feels much nicer because it's directly tied to an economy rather than everyone just having to grab their stuff from the warehouse. My favorite aspect is the fact that, as of right now, you don't have to worry about a mass deathstreak like in games like Banished after a certain amount of itme. What I'd wish for however, is a more expanded help section as well as some changes to the Kingdom Splendor.. it's really difficult to generate Splendor off of the Wooden Keep by itself.Personal future wish.. an Open Map editor the few maps within the game get a little stale after a bit.	----->	6

56305050	Very strategic game, people might say its P2W but it's really not. Great community with alot of people who are willing to help new players. No need to pay anything if you spent enough time, i haven't spent a dime on this game but im only missing around 6 or 7 cards which you can get in different ways. Either you spent money (obviously), get enough shards to craft it or get lucky with power / season tokens. Every 4th spin with power tokens and free tokens grants you at least a supreme card / supreme bonus (gold or ruby's)	----->	4
56312856	Foundation is easily my favorite city planner game. Despite only being in ALPHA the game has a ton to offer and the devs seem committed to creating a friendly, communicative relationship with the playerbase. The art style is really unique which gives the game a more lighthearted feel and is a great game to just relax to while listening to music or staying in on a cold day. 10/10 would recommend.	----->	7

56437331	Great game with a decent amount of content. Advancement is rewarding and fun. The tutorial is lacking, but after a few hours I was able to figure out how to manage resources and generate income. Food generation needs a buff, as I have trouble feeding my population with many dedicated farms, fisheries, and foraging stations. Beware of mods, taking them out of your game will corrupt your save. I'm looking forward to more content, this game has enormous potential.	----->	2

56538341	Pretty good game, there is a lot of stuff that does not really make any sense, and a lot of stuff that is really confusing and needs to be fixed but the game is in bata so im sure it will all get fixed as the game gets updates but from what you have for now its a pretty cool game but the economy is crap	----->	0
56540765	It's a fun game and even though it's still in early access, it's already very playable. Once you figure out how it works, the system seems reasonably balanced (I can keep every villager happy even with population over several hundred). The game lets you design your own medieval settlement, and apart from game elements, there are also features that are purely decorative, so you can for example enclose your town in walls and then change them later when you need space for expansion. This gives the game a pleasant sandbox feel even though you still need to think about economy and production chains.	----->	10
56542411	The system for building unique buildings is great, it has kept me playing way after having unlocked everything in the game. This is one of those games where I wouldn't mind starting a new world even after I've spent tons of time on my old one because of how you can make the monument buildings huge and looking very cool. Really looking forward to seeing more things added to this, there where a few things I was a little disappointed was not in the game yet, but hopefully they're just around the corner. I'd really like many more options for building a castle/keep most of all. Either way, liked this a lot.	----->	5
56558711	Great city builder that does away with the whole slots/little squares/ fitting blocks in their places style of so many before it.  Really scratches the itch of someone looking to play a medieval style game and a city-builder a the same time.	----->	-1

56570166	This is a good game, but it's still missing some things.Without an actual mechanic for war castles, walls, weapons and soldiers are useless (You can only use 5 soldiers at a time at this point).Also we need more buildings that give kingdom splendor. Currently the wooden keep is the only one and it has no other purpose. You also have to build a ton of those to get enough splendor. You could just temporarily increase the splendor a wood keep gives you until you develop a better solution.Names run out real quickly too. I have a ton of male#1836's in my village.Also children could be a good addition.	----->	2

56587895	This game is really fun but at the current stage in early access it falls a bit short. Once you town gets going there isnt that much to do.	----->	4
56589763	Beautiful, well thought out and lots of potential.  Needs to add some reason for the Soldiers other than for the occasional Kingdom requirement. Maybe they can catch thieves or bandits. Overall i enjoy this game and your ability to customize some of the buildings.	----->	4
56590662	Much good. Very wow	----->	4
56592890	A buddy of mine and I picked this game up on a lark a couple of  years back.  We were looking for a simple time waster while we waited on a group of friends playing some other game we didn't care for.  I've been hooked every since and have spread the love to many others.The basic concept of the game is fairly simple, build a deck of cards that you instantiate into the arena.  Those cards (minions/spells/etc) then autonomously follow their developer coded instructions in eliminating other minions or making their way to attack the opposing master(s).  The deck construction mechanic is fairly straightforward where you attempt build a deck that takes advantage of synergies between the cards and your master's powers.  It won't take you long to realize just  how easy it is to steal decks from other players.  When a strong meta emerges, fully two-thirds of the decks you face will be so similar as to be identical.  Most of the remainder will be decks setup to counter the meta.For me, the best part is taking a deck and becoming comfortable enough with it that you can counter strong meta decks or even decks that take advantage of the weaknesses of your deck.  Achieving victory from an underdog position through superior play is a blast.	----->	18

56638750	Fantastic little game if you enjoy chill city building games. It's still in Early Access and you can see it in the menu items that miss descriptions and details like that. However I didn't encounter any bugs or technical issues. The game misses any real danger, such as enemy factions or even the environment. So the game is all about slowly developing a peaceful town in an organic environment where the town develops naturally. I can see my self playing this game more and more while watching something on my 2nd screen.	----->	2

56689856	The core mechanic is similar to the earliest versions of the Half-Life mode 'The Ship', where you try to blend into NPCs to avoid getting assassinated. Chris polished this game to a shine, and somehow made the difficult balance work of making it both accessible and competitive regardless of your skill. And boy, does this game have skill ceiling. Do not let the game's presentation fool you, this game is as brutally competitive as DotA2. An absolute blast to play with a buddy over Voice.	----->	0

56928593	My mind is completely blown. For an unfinished Game with so many rough edges. The core of its city building is there. Some of the controls are hard to figure out or just missing. And the quest system is still being developed but that's what you'd expect with a early access game so no real complaint on it from me. I am however curious to see if city defense is going to be developed to be more dynamic and at the same time I'd like to see more interaction with distantly neighbouring cities, as well as the king you serve. All together this is an extremely fun and addicting game I can not wait to see where the developers take it further!!!	----->	5

There are times that it's hard to figure out how to reach different levels so that you can move up in the game, but that is part of the fun.

57323757	I bought this game several months ago, and this is the first time it loaded.  Thanks for the many updates that made this possible.  So far, it's exactly the kind of thing I like.  The villagers are autonomous once you assign them to a skill.  Still learning.  A house was built but nobody is living in it.Second try was better.  People living in houses, and they upgrade with a flowery shrub nearby.  Started trading for tools and saw fish available, so started bringing them in.  Sent out berries and a couple soldiers as requested.	----->	2

The whole game feels natural this is still in alpha and I seriously cannot wait for whats to come. I have owned this game from a total of 2 days.. and I've every free moment playing it (16 hours).I highly recommend this as a relaxing yet challenging game for anyone to play.	----->	2

57541163	The same as Settlers, the game becomes more in depth the longer you play from basic needs to more complex luxuries and tax. Happiness is needed to keep the people from wandering away, newcomers re regular. The weather may set in but there are no big losses. The king may demand soldiers but they always return and he gives you free land. Graphics are good, general game play is good. I'm around a quarter of the way in and there are no glitches so far. If you've never played these types of games then this is a nice new version of one. If you have, then more of the same but very playable.	----->	2

It's like lemmings meets Cities: Skylines but it's medieval.EDIT: I've been playing for just over 100 hours at this point and I love this game. I keep coming back month after month whenever I feel the need to sit back and relax. This game has done nothing but improve since  I first wrote this review and  the  development team keeps  putting out great updates. This is a city builder well worth your time and your money.	----->	14

57736688	I have been enjoying playing this game even though it does have things that need to be fixed. The potential is there. So far the biggest thing holding me back is the fact that once I hit about 70 people, everyone's names were just male# and female#. It has gotten better as I've taken breaks and come back a few times. I expect it will continue to make excellent progress.	----->	7

57769625	Great game for the creative minds. I love the fact that it's gridless and allows rotational freedom of buildings. Also the monuments you can build like Churches, Lords Manor and Keep are very customizable, allowing for you to build your village they way you have always wanted!Furthermore, the game has an interesting quest system where there are three factions to serve to gain points with which additional building blocks and buildings can be unlocked. Lastly trading is great part in keeping your economy up and running.	----->	15

57894610	Fun and innovative town builder. The early access period has gone on for a long time, but the developers are active and at least they didn't release an unfinished game.  It's great already I can't wait til it's even more fleshed out!	----->	6

57902003	Super nice city builder with a pleasant art style.Extremely cool system of building up your city - instead of placing houses on a grid, you can assign zones in which your little people build their own houses when they need more. Makes for awesome, organic medieval cityscapes and is a welcome change from the rigid square layouts you know from Banished or Anno games.Devs are very active and communicative, and the game gets loads of free updates in content and QoL.It's indie, so don't expect the depth an Anno game would offer, still I definitely recommended if you're into city sims or simulators.	----->	13

58024427	This Alpha version has great potential for the future. Devs working, gathering feedbacks, which is always good.It it better than the last time i played it, the difference at this moment is that I saved my game and will continue tomorrow. The mecanics are nice once you understand it a little bit, but the UI still lacks much improvement. The UI is too small, they have a option to enlarge by 150% and 200% and it simply turns blurry and ugly, this needs improvement. The icons need more diversity too, at this moment it is way confusing at first until you explore the screens and options to know what does what.Overall, I'm having my fun right now and I hope for much more improvements over time.	----->	12

58306511	Great idea, but needs slightly better execution. If you're craving a gridless city builder, then Foundation isn't a bad shout. It's classically medieval, resource farming, people managing fun. Place anything anywhere, your villagers will create paths, choose their own house designs, and buy whatever they want. However, there are problems. There is almost no variation game-to-game, and some villagers are so resource depleting that since the update to not have infinite bushes to farm food, it's game over for noob players before it even begins.  Buildings are often unsightly. The game revolves around you setting up trading routes to get other resources, but the game loop is boring and repetitive. Villagers are like petulant children, demanding everything and just up and leaving when they don't get the berries they want. Everything takes hours to complete and it's just a chore watching your church being built on an overlooking hillside not being built for sometimes hours real-life time for some stupid trade route reason. There are many more little annoyances that make it less fun. It's an alright painting with a great frame. The technical stuff is there, but they haven't actually made an end-game worth exploring. If it's more than £10-£15, don't pick it up.	----->	-3

58509907	Having played thirteen hours thus far upon writing this, I can say that this game is quite fun and cozy feeling. The music is great, graphics are pretty good (the lifeless eyes are kind of off putting), but the game is still in Alpha and definitely needs some additions. The largest gripes I have are with the Splendor system, and a better explanation or rework of the happiness system/commodity system. Currently, you will start building structures and only learn afterwards that you are required to add expansions to boost their positivity, only after they are surrounded by houses and other structures. There are also several buildings that do not have any way of assigning villagers to work in, making the buildings completely moot in some areas. Namely the Monastery, which has been a hassle from what I have seen within the forums on Steam while searching for answers about several things within the game.Simply wait until a few more updates are implemented before buying it.	----->	16

Why do I have all these berries and bakeries and milk even, but I cannot execute a pie?!!? Also I can hear birds but a nice V never seems to fly over.)Even still, they say I can grow hops and brew beer before the end of this year, and I cannot wait.I love this game, and every step the devs make towards completion make me want to build Lordran all over again. If you are interested, reading this, wonder what Lordran is, then for god's sake, buy this game.	----->	10

58662624	Shows promise of being the Cities Skylines of medieval city builders. Clearly still in beta, lots of little kinks with villagers getting stuck from time to time, but nothing that would deter an experienced city sim player. Some of the build order favored by the game is a little unintuitive at first and I would recommend some of the basic guides on the forums. I don't know if I would have figured out how to upgrade my citizens without the help of the online community. Very fun though!	----->	9
58665101	overall a good game, still a bit buggy but that is to be expected in an early access title	----->	3

58691368	I wonder, did I create this game while drunk and forget I made it?  nope that can't be it. well then the game dev must be a mind reader and reading my mind!  No you say?  They are not?  Well then surely I must be friends with the dev and they totally picked my brain to create this game!  No they didn't and don't call me surely!   This game is everything I wanted in a city building game! Based in medevil times, its graphics are like eye candy and hey when you build a building and your dudes or dudettes start walking there to work or buy stuff, the grass wears out in a pathway to the building as more chars walk over it!   I mean does it really matter?  no but it's the little things that make a good game great!   PS I know its not  a lot of hours but trust me, it will be.   	----->	2

58960764	Game is still in development but the concept is 10/10.It's fun to play and has great replay value.Just needs more people playing it - though I'm told you're supposed to go to Discord for match making until the in-game lobby/match making system gets improved.	----->	7
58969416	For an early access game Foundation is headed in the right direction. I like that the focus is just on city building and keeping your people happy so it makes for a fun laid back city builder. The towns folk look a little cartoony but the graphics are beautiful and music fits right in. I really like the organic look and feel of the game. Towns folk creating and beating down walk paths is a cool feature. There are a few things that could be added such as keyboard and mouse hotkey/shortcuts. They could also add more/different quests, more building options and more tier unlocks. The game is not perfect and has a way to go but it's a fun great looking game. With it still being early access I see more content and updates to come.	----->	24
58970323	Really fun! The putting is touchy so it takes a bit to get used to.  But love the environment! Great music and great graphics.  Lots of challenging holes.  Definite replay value! highly recommend!	----->	6
58980513	Foundation is great relaxing fun. It's more complex than it looks at first glance, and the gridless construction/expansion system give the player complete control over how the settlement progresses. You'll end up with an organic community where neighborhoods and work districts make sense. I cannot recommend Foundation highly enough.	----->	5

58981508	Although in early access, i believe there is a lot of fun and content within this game. The visuals are beautiful but somewhat cartoonish. It's a very relaxing game at a relatively slow pace. I look forward to what will be added to the game in future!	----->	7

59074404	Fidel Dungeon Rescue es un entretenido y desafiante videojuego desarrollado por un equipo de programadores independientes liderados por Daniel Benmergui, el reconocido autor de títulos como Iwish i were the Moon o Today i die.Definido por sus responsables como un puzzle-crawler, en Fidel asumiremos el rol de un simpático can, el cual deberá adentrarse en una peligrosa mazmorra para rescatar a una tierna abuelita. La mecánica de juego de Fidel consiste en trazar el mejor camino para superar cada nivel, intentando eliminar a la mayor cantidad de monstruos en el proceso. Lo interesante es que cada enemigo tiene una forma específica para ser derrotado y parte del encanto es descubrir como hacerlo, aunque para ello debamos morir una y otra vez. Aquí no hay tutoriales ni indicaciones que nos lleven de la mano y es por eso que la muerte no se siente como un castigo, porque al momento de volver a comenzar una nueva partida habremos aprendido algo nuevo que nos permitirá llegar cada vez mas lejos. Cabe destacar que no es un juego especialmente largo, aunque llegar al final tomará su tiempo, no solo porque cada fase -la cual está generada proceduralmente- sea un rompecabezas en si misma, sino porque Fidel esconde muchos secretos y niveles especiales que aportan un plus al conjunto. Fidel Dungeon Rescue es un videojuego original, rápido y atrapante, con un apartado artístico muy notable y sin tiempos de carga, cuya única pretención es la de divertir y estrujarnos el cerebro pensando la mejor forma de superar cada escenario ¡Ah, y sos un perrito! ¡Recomendado!Lo Bueno:+Original y desafiante.+Variedad de mecánicas y niveles.+La mezcla de géneros funciona bien,+Sos un perrito.Lo Malo:-Después de unas horas se pierde la sensación de aleatoriedad.	----->	-4

59087975	I'd like to start the review by saying I love this game. City builders/management have always been my bread and butter. I've put a lot of time into Civ V and VI, Cities Skylines, Banished, and now this. There are a few minor QOL things that I attribute to the early dev stage, for example the clunky UI and lack of tutorial on a lot of things. My biggest issue is it becomes food management simulator around 180 pop, in my experience. Food production doesn't scale well with high pop, so despite half my town working in food production, I still end up being short on food somehow, even with a stockpile of 2000+ berries/bread/cheese. It's a very steep learning curve and I've tanked multiple towns because everyone will be getting food fine, and then suddenly half my pop is starving. Overall 4/5	----->	3

59303687	Well, I put some time into this game and I really fell in love with it. I will be back after struggling so much at first, then finally it clicked and is definitely fun, challenging and has that one more turn or rather one more supply chain type of engagement. I realized it wasn't the game, it was me. Right now, in this game I see so much potential if the late/end game doesn't get buggered, that is. I think that this could be the city builder to rule them all. I am hoping for something truly epic. Maybe you'll be able to ascend to the throne or secede from the monarchy, starting your own little Scotland-esque liberation (minus Mel Gibson)? I don't need the replay value augmented, that seems to be inherent at this point, what I'm truly hoping for is a reason to keep playing and playing. My favorite city builder of all time is Empire: Rise of the Middle Kingdom. I have played that game on at least 5 different PCs over the years. The monuments, gods and invasions gave it that lasting appeal due to how much they upped the difficulty, once you started to master or rather feng shui-ed your thriving city.  I get a little of that so far in this game and my fingers are crossed that it will be oozing it when the game is finished. 	----->	7
59309663	a few bugs here and there but it is a great game, great customization and great free city building	----->	10
59318601	So far I am enjoying myself quite a bit. I wanted a nice relaxing game, and I found it with Foundation. So far I have not encountered any bugs but I have only been playing for a short while. I have health issues and am unable to play fast paced games anymore, so it's nice to be able to enjoy playing something again.	----->	10
59349108	It's good but it requires a bit more to be the best.There are some really awesome ideas, such as customization of important buildings, splendor points that furthers the relationship with factions and so on... I would love to see this direction explored a bit more.Note that its early acces and all, so I can't recommand it just yet as I would a full game, but i sense much potential in this one.	----->	12

59422801	I am not into city management games, but this is an exception.  I have tried them in the past and not really grasped the basics of gameplay.  I enjoy the look of this game, so it gave me reason to learn it.  It is a fun game, easy to learn and understand, and hopefully I will learn enough about the basics of city building games to maybe have another try at others in my library.	----->	9

59465133	good	----->	3
59466734	This game idea is coming along very well.  As it exists today it has a fairly in-depth game-play with an incredible amount of options for those who enjoy a constructive and building experience.  The supply chain options are very fun to optimize.  Figuring out how to direct the little citizens is a fun thing too.  Walls work most of the time and the no go zone works great when that fails.  It's a nice change from the normal zombie and survival games out there.  That said you probably have to have a low troll count in your DNA to appreciate this game, otherwise you may well do what comes naturally to you.	----->	17

59483089	Crossout is a great game because you can make a masterpiece of a vehicle, or a functional piece of junk depending on the parts you have. Even though it is a free to play game it is possible to earn the in game money without buying the money with real money (it is still an option though), gain your resources through PVP or the fuel guzzling PVE raid mode (Your fuel refills at the start of each day.), or the free roaming story based pve mode Awakening as well as other modes. Selling your resources on the market is an option and can give you a lot or a little cash back depending on the player driven market value (Player driven markets I don't care for.) or you can save your junk and build better more effective weapons, modules, or cosmetics with them via the workbenches provided by one of the 7 factions you will interact with (Getting your reputation points up with each faction gets you WAY better armor parts to use with your builds as well.). PVP is VERY competitive but still fun, you never know what will happen, will you be missing half your wheels or be disarmed or will you do the un-wheeling or dis-arming? Anyway, PVE Raids vary in difficulty depending on what you want to try and if your build's power score will allow you to enter the match, a multi-objective based mission in the raids keep you on your toes and you get to fight a boss at the end of each raid. Personally, Crossout is both a fun game for crafting and creating the most odd looking vehicle imaginable, and frustrating for it's competitive PVP and sometimes hard PVE raids but I love it all the same and I do recommend everyone at least try it once, it is free after all.This is Murlin The Great signing off, see you on the battlefield!	----->	29
59490337	Fun little game, looking forward to seeing a bit more refinement	----->	0
59500574	It has the makings of a great game - classic city builder, more along the lines of Banished than say, Cities Skylines but with it's own unique elements like organic growth and the general art style.The only criticism I have (And it isn't really a criticism given it's an early access game) is that after you get your initial town set up and 100 or so citizens, the game starts to run out of new things to do, there's clear areas where content hasn't yet been developed (Like actual castles not really being a thing yet) and placeholder text and such is quite common to see. But all in all, extremely happy to be supporting Foundation. Just the 16 hours I've played is enough to get me pretty hyped for the December Update and what's to come in future. 	----->	9

59536715	Where do I begin? Golf It! has to be one of the most intensive realistic golfing games in the gaming platform. From hitting on par to getting a hole in one, it feels like you are really out there on the course putting balls and driving them hundreds of feet down course. One thing I didn't like about the game is the unrealistic concept of ball skins, hats, and trails. How am I supposed to compete with someone if they have a rainbow trail? I can't. I just can't. What am I supposed to do when I enter a game, have my golfing cap ready and on, handwarmers activated, ready to slap some sick putts, and then someone with a rainbow trail comes in and hits the ball full force and gets a hole in one from across the map? I can't do it or anything. I purchased this game with the intent to train, adapt, and overcome all my previous notions on what golfing is, and what it means to me, and to prepare myself to hit the course in real life and possibly take my golfing career away from the driving range, and to the PGA tournaments and meet my idol Rory McIlroy. It's just not possible when I play a game that has unrealistic physics related to golfing, cannot properly depict the aerodynamics of a golf ball in the real world, and not even include spin? Trash. With all that being said, I would recommend this game, 9/10. It's well worth the buy.	----->	6
59542591	good	----->	3

59591291	I really like the idea for this game. It's very creative and I appreciate it's uniqueness.  I think the designer could do a bit better with programming it though because my computer tries very hard to run the game. Also, it would be nice if they added a bit more detail in directions and instructions. Sometimes I am at a complete loss of what to do and more detail in explaining things would be very helpful. But overall, I love this game.	----->	10

59702325	It's simple yet entertaining, it has small cute challenges. Each enemy has a different pattern that you have to figure out, and the dungeons are randomized; there is not that much variety to them after a while, but it's still fun.The game will not tell you much about how the mechanics work, you find it out as you play it; it also has different modes so to speak and a  small easter egg which eventhough unpolished, I actually enjoyed learning how to play.It's super cute too, I have already finished most of the challenges, but  I still like to replay it from time to time ♥. I still have a few achievements to complete.	----->	7

59762136	Games is really fun. But in order to play it I had to drop £40! A copy for me and a copy for my brother. I want to play it with my GF but I can I justify £60 spend on this game. No. Absolutely not.  The game needs to support spawned copies or a price drop ASAP.Fun game. Too expensive as you'll need to buy 2 copies. Only fun with friends. Is not fun with randos online.	----->	9

59964279	I am at 200 hours across Steam and GOG.WHY SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME? It is a fully simulated city building strategy game. The villagers actually go to the market to eat. The material is actually mined and move across the map by actual villagers. Villagers actually go to work, take breaks, go home, go to buy clothes, etc. Your job is to place the buildings, assign the villagers jobs, buy territory, manage your military, manage trade relations, customize your city, etc. The game has actual supply chains from the raw material to the finished products. Plus, this game keep it fun without heavy micromanagingRecently (update 3.8.1 on December, 17, 2021) this game has become much more fun to play and in-depth. Some features are still in their early works like the military system. Although, the primary features such as the actual village building and the supply chains are well fleshed out. Plus, the resource tracking feature is a much needed addition.The UI still needs a few additions, but the updates have made in worlds better than before.This game has a very bright future. Even in its current state, this game is definitely my favorite city building strategy game. The supply chains are realistic and actually make sense. You must build your village from just a village center to a sprawling metropolis. It gives you plenty of freedom to build how you like.How It Plays:First you start by choosing your starting territory, then you place your village center. Next you must place buildings, assign villagers jobs, and begin harvesting your local resources. Next, you build more building to convert those raw material to useful material such as stone to polished stone and wood into planks. Then, you begin taking those finished material into working products like swords, clothes, churches, and everything your villagers need to thrive.Eventually you will look at your village and see a metropolis that expands across the entire map and realize you have sunken dozens of hours building your perfect village.	----->	25

60126992	I bought it in early acces and I don't regret it. It is quite simple but I can find myself playing for hours non stop. Its simplicity makes it very relaxing and the absolut freedom to do with the town wahtever you want is just fantastic. I like the features and production chains they've been adding. I would recommend it if you enjoy city builders or similar games with no military component (which I find a plus rather than a setback).	----->	6

60191111	DISCLAIMER: Review prior to recent update! This game is still being developed.I played this game when it was first available on steam and while you would think it would be a cacophony of bugs and distractions from the core of the game, I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the game. The opening title screen is exactly a scene from the game, a distant castle on a hilltop with a hopeful sun rising behind it. The song they chose for the opening of the game is enchanting and calm, I'm reminded of Scottish moors and a mythical sense of old world forests and mountains. The game mechanics are hospitable and organic, there is no world grid to snap your building to, you simply rotate and move the structure in any degree you wish. Residential housing is done slightly different, instead of placing houses individually you use your cursor as a brush to paint the landscape with areas you want your villagers to build, you can also adjust the brush size. The villagers build in this designated area any way they want but there is a desirability factor involved here.  Painting the landscape with areas also come in different flavors like, replanting a forest here, harvest this area here, plant your crop in this area, and don't do anything at all in this area, which provide you with control over what happens to what. If you don't want your logging camp cutting down a small portion of trees that looks good next your village, then paint it red and they won't touch it, for example. Don't worry, the paint colors only show up when you click the filter on or you go to the painting region area menu. One of the most interesting features in game is the way your villagers blaze trails through the grass. When a villagers goes to building something you will begin to see what route they take to the structure as the grass is slowly worn away to create a road. The very organic nature of this comes to life as you increase in population and your village comes alive with paths and roads weaving throughout the land. If you abandon a road for too long, the grass grows back!Overall the game is still finding itself mechanically as they add new ways to manage your village with troop missions, Lord manor abilities, pathing for villagers, details about the villagers, and efficiency of production lines. The only problems I have had is the fact that there's no story in a world that is screaming for one. If you love building and managing little medieval villages, this game will capture so much of your time! If you need deeper meaning behind your games where you want backgrounds of characters and personality, then I would hold off. 	----->	8

60205764	Very clearly still an early access game, so it's missing depth. At this point it's not difficult to reach the 'end' of the game, i.e. you've done everything that's possible. BUT I really enjoy playing to get to that point so even now it was worth the money for me.It has a really good base for what could be a great game, and the devs obviously care enough to keep updating and adding content.7/10 I enjoy playing even if it's not finished yet.	----->	13

60260899	The game is good. It's, it's it's a fun game you know. It's still in development but I like it. Like, you can spend a lot of time building a nice city. It's funny you know, I've spent a lot of hours into it and I forgot that it's still in development. Of course, there is still some improvements needed here and there, but you know I can tell that the developers are working pretty hard. The mods are a bit scarce but the community is growing you know. Like, it's a good game, you know. If you like medieval city builders then you'd would be pretty happy.	----->	21

60285524	Ive just started Playing and enjoying myself. its taken me a bit to figure out the mechanics as they dont have a tutorial, but youtube has been quite helpful. So far ive been having alot of fun. it reminds me of a mix of banished and the Sims. the housing is like sims and can be annoying but its not game breaking use some decoration and eventually they upgrade themselves no biggy.  Would i recomend yes, but i like city building games.  But i do believe they need a tutorial to cover some of the things like Splendor, the people, king, and clergy part  and how to go abouut unlocking, also the storage, trade menus can be confusing.	----->	5

60286924	I've played it and I have to say it's pretty fun. I think I prefer it over the other mini golf games because the editor gives you more free range and there really isn't a limit to how hard you can hit the ball. The strength of the swings takes some getting use to since you don't have a power meter but I don't say it drastically takes away from the game.	----->	3
60288903	一筆書きパズル。おすすめ。やればわかる系のゲームデザイン。生放送にもおすすめ。ダンジョン自動生成だが、ローグライク感は薄い。所有感はマインスイーパーが近い。・ゲーム概要15フロアを攻略する。RPGのようにレベルやHPやコインの要素がある。基本は制限時間なし。いくらでも考えてOK。フロア内なら一手戻しで初手まで完全にやり直せる。できる範囲で多くの稼ぎになるようにパズルするといい。敵によって倒せるタイミングとか色々パターンあるので一手戻しを多用しつつ調べていくといい。・豆知識初手でEnter押すとスタートとゴールを入れ替えられるCtrlで吠える（いろいろ効果あり）ダンジョンにタイムアタック機能があったら嬉しかった。（別途タイマーを用意すればいいだけの話だが）	----->	0

60302628	Amazing graphics for a game of it's kind, not many city builders put much detail into smaller parts of the game, and leave them sort of raw for the player to see when they zoom in or are panning about their build, however with this game I have created many masterpiece screenshots while zoomed in that have absolutely wowed me. Love the free build, gridless design as well, looking forward to finding out where the devs take this game. 8.5/10 <3 My only complaints include the size of the UI, not necessarily that the tabs are hidden, like Banished does, also I believe that in the future more could be done to include combat? If not already planned.	----->	6
60303518	If you like Settlers, LiF:FV or Banished, this game is for you.One of the better settlement games in development at the moment. Content takes a bit long to get released between updates & there is limited game play at the moment, but it's still far better than some games that are released at v1 already. Animations are great, detail is excellent and the 360 rotation for building placement along with organic pathing makes this one of the nicest builders I've played in a while.	----->	8

60543160	First thing that comes to mind is the amount of time I can spend fiddling around with making my city and the amount of money I spent on the game. I find myself thinking about my next steps on what to build, what jobs to assign to the incoming villagers, preparing for the inbound traders, and where to zone and build next. I've restarted cities a few times now to see if I can get things just right and although it might be possible to zone and organize the city super efficiently, I'm liking the challenge that comes with there not being one best way to build the city. I may come back and add some cons later but at the moment I'm still figuring things out.	----->	5

60578168	这个游戏实在是野心勃勃，能够发现浓重的法老王，凯撒系列的血统，在城市建造和居民与工作之间的关系做出了伟大的突破，可以说拥有突破性设计。然而同时，游戏内容的不完整与功能设计上的缺失使得人们很容易意识到创新的代价。游戏中的所有系统都采用了更加激进的方式去组合，比如让人费解的王权，神权，工匠点数系统；点数解锁与人口升级解锁的双轨游戏节奏推进，游戏中仍旧充斥着各种赶工与未完成的味道，目前来说肯定是不值得票钱的。不过我相信Foundation这个游戏，本身就具有突破性和其特殊的游戏历史地位，所以说我还是推荐每个热爱城市建造类游戏的玩家可以尝试一下。	----->	0

Takes a while to figure out what works best, which is also nice. However after u have figured out what works and have spent the entire school night unlocking and building everything there is no more point in playing. Im on to the next one but this was nice	----->	6
60651098	I am a huge fan of city building games. **When this game is finished,** it will be among my favorites like Banished and Cities Skylines. At time of writing, I think the game needs about 3x more content to really shine. It also needs a good amount of polish in terms of the UI, labels and copy, and tutorials. I can recommend simply because I want to see this game succeed.	----->	14

60653043	I am a huge fan of city building games and this is by far the best one I've played in a vanilla version. It's all the things I like about the genre: optimizing your citizens, creating beautiful landscapes, and time management and with none of the annoying things that I dislike, like strict grid building, over-complicated production, and completely hostile environments. The agency of the townspeople to build their own houses, and create their own paths is refreshing and it makes each town look organic and unique while minimizing my effort in placing houses and roads. This is the game I have been waiting for! Thank you devs for a job well done. You've made a city building nerd very happy!	----->	10

60724237	I can claim my self as city building game fanatic. I've seen many this kind of game, where you should build from nothing and manage your people to survive. But this game is exceptional. What I really like is the road system. You can't set the road on your own, that's what your people decide. Thus, it looks more realistic road than any other game. It's also happened to residential area. It's not you who put where the houses be built, but your people.Another thing I like is on this state of game, you won't be attacked by any hostile. You can build your kingdom freely and peacefully. But instead there's no any hostile, still, you can build your army. I think there will be more update for this aspect. But I hope there's an option to play it peacefully.And last, I know this is still early access, so I don't complaining too much about this. But after some times, the game will showing random black dots on your screen. First, I was worry that my graphic card got artifact, but I found it wasn't. They will be gone if you reopen the game.In the end, the game was good. In my opinion, the gameplay is kind of fresh. I hope there'll be more content ahead.	----->	7

60810322	Lots of fun and enjoyably challenging!I've been longing for a city building game that incorporates a warring system (something like Mount and Blade or Total War). Foundation would be even better if it took the game in that direction. Invasions maybe? Maybe even warring towns? Seeing your town being infiltrated by the enemy would be a lot of fun to defend!Regardless, this game is great and has a lot of potential to be even better!	----->	12
60817722	Hesitated a long time before buying this one; no regrets, it's totally adictive! At first it looks quite easy, but once you get into it, balencing the finance and keeping people happy requires attention. I can see that the devs have done an excellent job so far, although the game has a lot more potential IMO to make it really shine - which is what all gamers want!If you hesitated, don't, get it now.	----->	5

60838263	Fun for 60 hours now, the time I needed to get the current 7 achievements. And! has a lot of potential to become an awesome city builder in the future. Do not expect a lot of depth yet. Some [b]tips[/b] things that might be useful for new players below:1. Have your villagers living as close to their work as possible. Best way I have found to do this is to have your villagers live in a stripe formation with branches of different kinds of production chains. 2. Do not forget to mark berry bushes as an extraction area.3. Bioindustry is very effective, have as many animals/ sheep of dairy farms in a small space. Acres per animal is not important.4. You need a ridiculous amount of churches and markets even for the middle ages5. It doesn’t matter if you send 2 or more soldiers on a mission, perhaps even one, I didn’t test it, the ROI: 1.000 gold and 20 wine is the same.6. Keep you villagers satisfaction above 60+ at all time and cost because onces it drops below it’s really hard to get it up again and it is downhill from that point. 7. Last but not least. Have patience. Only speed things up when budget and villagers satisfaction are rising.[b]Needs[/b]:1. It does really need a balancing improvement and new challenges at about 400+ villagers because at this time it is food management and nothing else.[b]Bugs[/b] I have found, nothing disturbing because it really is playable now.1. When a market or a new addition to a market is ready and I click the notification icon, the screen jumps to the corner of the screen. The same goes for churches and the manor.2. When you put a cross on a rustic church you can’t turn the cross, it can only face one direction but the mouse icon changes as if you could turn it.3. At one game I kept getting depts even below -10.000 but onces I saved and reloaded my cash would be 0 again. [b]Would be nice:[/b]1. When you destroy a building, the inventory and other stuff should be picked up by granary/ warehouse dudes.2. To be able to see the production for a period of time in a certain building. So you can see how effective the building is. Now it is mostly guessing.	----->	4

60912995	Played an hour of game time.Not up to any military stuff yet, but so far this is a very pleasant village building game. The 'organic' nature of the village has some nice touches. Dirt paths appearing where the people walk often and the people choosing where to build their houses (within a specified zone) are nice touches.	----->	9
60915953	Love this game! It's simple but beautiful. And it isn't overwhelming you with UI like other building games. On the other hand, this can cause some loss of information but it's not that bad.Originally I planned to buy this game so I can somehow simulate how a town/city grows for my pen&paper campaign but I always end up with a huge ass city because I cannot stop :DIt has some small bugs but nothing serious and it's still early access. A big thank you to the developers :)	----->	-2

60924833	I love a city builder and Foundation is no exception. I really like how the villagers create paths as they walk, and how you draw in the areas where you want your townsfolk to chop wood, mine, farm, or build houses. That makes it really easy to establish little zones and neighborhoods, then change them up  super easily as you evolve your town. All of the ways you can customize your buildings are really cool too. I have seen quite a few big updates come out since I bought this game, and it has only gotten more interesting. If you want to take care of a village of hobbits, then this is the game for you.	----->	14

60937582	J'ai découvert ce jeu en regardant des parties sur Youtube.On me l'a offert et je ne suis pas déçue.Non difficile à prendre en main. Je le trouve joli et maniable.Du côté espion : ce jeu fait appel à votre discrétion et à votre capacité à vous cacher dans la foule. Du côté sniper : vous devez être un fin observateur et à l'affût du moindre geste suspect. Sympa à jouer avec un ami, sans stress, un petit jeu tranquille.L'ambiance sonore qui ne contient pas de musique (mais des blablas non assourdissants) n'est pas gênante.	----->	0

60948119	It brings the nostalgia of Knights and Merchants, settlers a bit, vikings and many more 90's and 00's sims from my childhood  but at same time it carves it's own path. The grind is comfortable, the difficulty just right to figure out things though trial and error, feels like it used to do, a child exploring unknown. Switching what to sell, buy, what to store and where, pure joy. You can see this game isn't the premium industry's child, and that's a good thing. Graphics, aesthetics are delicious and the music borrows from the best of best. Still lots of work needed but it is probably next to Planetbase one of my faves in recent times.	----->	8

61026677	While Foundation is still an Early Access Game they have established a solid foundation (no pun intended) for a great game, and as they begin to flesh out details, it is coming together quite nicely.   The game currently supports modding through the MOD.IO platform, but I understand that there are plans to add Steam Workshop support.   I enjoy City Builder/Village Builders like Cities Skylines, Banished, Forest Village, Depraved, and Osiris.   I am, unfortunately, quite heavily addicted to trying to lay things out in perfect grids.   Even in games that encourage you be more organic in your building, I find myself building a series of small grids.   Foundation is the first game that has broken me of this.   I love seeing how the town develops and grows.    The one thing that can  be a bit tedious with this game is that it depends very heavily on really maximizing the distances your works move from home to their job as well as any travel they need to do in order to do their jobs.  This is exacerbated by the fact that you don't actually have any control over where your workers live beyond setting up areas that are zoned for housing.  It is entirely up to them to utilize them, and they may or may not build close to where they work.    The only thing you can do about this is to periodically reassign jobs to everyone based on where they live, one at a time.  This can be quite time consuming and tedious.I do want to make clear that they are working on an update which will allow the citizens to automatically relocate where they live to move closer to their jobs.   This update was originally scheduled for release in December 2019, but was unfortunately delayed.   I don't see this delay as a bad thing.  I would rather have an update delayed that see it released in an unfinished state.   Hopefully this update will come out early in 2020.   I think it will make an already awesome game even better.I would recommend this game for any of my friends as it is still fun to play and I have faith that it will only get better as time goes on.   Even if you decide it's not for you right now, I would definitely suggest you keep an eye on it to see where it goes as it progresses.   	----->	29

61189568	Mad Max meets Twisted Metal, very fun to play with friends especially with the fusion builds which allow for you and your friend or a whole team to fuse together, it does have a very slow progression system which might turn most people away, once you watch a few guides and have a decent understanding how the market, crafting and building works it doesn't seem all that overwhelming afterall.	----->	5
61191856	One problem: there are 'features' or 'levels' that need to be 'unlocked' by performing 'certain' tasks or 'quests'.  I am unable to find out what are the actual 'events' that need to be completed to achieve these goals.   As I move through the simulation, performing tasks as needed or perhaps just those that are 'presented,' I find some valuable function has been 'unlocked'; without a 'clue' as to how I did it.  When I start another session, I'm not sure how I reached some of the goals in the prior session.	----->	1

61287995	I enjoy this game!However, some slight improvements could be made to the building system. Placing parts of different sets to the current build would be a big plus i.e that is compatible with the snap placement system! Being able to adjust heights of objects you are trying to place would be incredibly helpful for decorations on buildings. A night and day system would be awesome. Having the option for a grid placement ( a terrace etc) of housing would be a good option for those with a need for organisation. There isn't much room for castle building without the use of mods. The fortress would be good to have a stone set, like the lord mayor house so we could incorporate it into stone builds. Some decorative items like fountains, more trees, plants, stone pavement would be great too. I know it is still in development which is why I am writing this review as maybe some developer may see this. I normally don't leave reviews but for a game with so much potential, I felt I had to. Well done guys for a great game!	----->	20

61364614	I'm loving it already despite being in early access. This game has Sooooo much potential.  The grid-less city building is great although you really have to be careful with spacing things out well because you have to leave room for people to walk.  The monument building is a really fun way to customize your city... it is my favorite features from any city-builder I have played.  There are a few kinks and features that will make some big improvements to come, but it's good a solid foundation so far.Couple tips for newcomers:1.  I had a few failed attempts at first (bad production line setup, bad layout, etc.) Every restart I've had has created a much smoother city.  Don't expect to get it all perfect on the first city. 2.  You can turn off immigration.  Unless you are consistently adding new sources of food, you need to put on the brakes every once in a while and let things settle down.3.  You can have multiple food stands in the same market... Once you get later on in a city, It's nice to have a few different food types in stock in the more highly congested parts of town.4.  Cities can have popular areas, but don't force everyone to live in a single central area... I try to keep all my villagers less than 100m from their place of employment..  I'd rather have them wandering on their free time to fill their needs rather than making them work too far from home (and ideally they never have to wander too far for anything).5. Watch out for the ! symbol in the top... if it's red there's a major issue stopping villagers from completing tasks (usually stuck or no path available) if it's yellow there's a less serious issue, like too much stuff or not enough stuff.  Yellow warnings are helpful to manage the production line.   Sometimes the Red warning will disappear when a villager gives up on trying to do the thing they can't do, but you still need to fix it!!  Wait for the red to come back and pause the game, then take a look at the issue and find a solution.  Don't just assume that because it goes away that the problem is solved.	----->	14

61427724	I really like the idea of this game and much of the game that I have seen is nice. However, not being able to place my own houses irks me to no end. In this game you paint a residential zone and your people build the houses on their own, but there is no planning and so much wasted space. If anyone can tell me how to solve this problem, I am all ears.	----->	-1

61477280	I find Foundation to be an exceptional city builder game. Unique in the gridless format... the citizen's form their own roads as they travel, which is something that I absolutely love in a medieval style city as it adds to the flavor of the town.I have a game on every map type and I love the challenges presented on each. I look forward to whatever else is in store in the coming year.	----->	6
61479848	Great City Builder and game flow.  Amazingly well-done!  Only issue I as well as others have seen are the colors and size of the icons.  The Overall UI is well done but could be increased, font-size perhaps and icons size.  Although the game does not come with a tutorial, it took about 15 mins to figure the system out and then just start over and wala.  City was prospering!One other thing I think the game needs is Multiplayer/CoOp mode. Would be awesome to play this with friends on same map.I give this an amazing thumbs up and look forward to future updates, fixes and the whole-nine-yards!Well done Polymorph!	----->	8

61500289	Foundation is fairly relaxed and enjoyable. It is great to play while you watch a show in the background and a wonderful introduction to colony builders if you are new to the genre. If you have experience with colony builders, you may enjoy some of the more unique aspects of the game, like the organic feeling of your villages as villagers naturally carve out their paths throughout the villages as they go about their lives, and the monument building/customization. Game is relaxed and fun.	----->	16

61547591	If you like games like Banished and similar, Foundation will be right up your alley. As a city builder, it is rather quite fun. I like the quests that you get every now and then witch encourage you to do develop resources or jobs to fullfill. They keep it engaging and feeling like there is more to the world then meets the eye. One thing this does really well so far is that it keep to the midevil ideas of city planning where, yes some things can be planned like your squares, the but rest of your city? Complete hot mess and yet, thats a good thing as it shows the organic nature cities can take.  :) 	----->	15

61550029	This is my general opinion on this game.Im generally in the middle with it, its not good, its not bad, but i'll put a yes for it anyways. On the upside, it does seem to teach me alot about how to be all spy like and act not suspicious infront of a sniper (this is very situational). On the other hand, it just seems kinda boring after a while. Hope this dosent get my life threatened.	----->	-2

61598838	Really loving this game, although I have run into a few problems that basically break the game for me. I understand that it is early development which means that it'll be fixed but right now it feels like once you get to the 150-200 population mark that transporters just all of a sudden don't work.Honestly it's not clear to me whether I have enough granaries or warehouses because they are always empty or the are completely full no in between. Early game seems to work better but when you have 3 granarys with berries selected and they're empty I question whether it works. On a more positive I'm super excited to see where this game goes, the freedom of it is awesome and I love the art style they have taken. There is so much more they can do and I'm seeing that through the latest updates. If you want a full game this isn't it yet. But if you wanna be apart of something new and exciting that still has some links, GET THIS GAME.	----->	23

61809264	I absolutely love this game despite its imperfection. I agree with other reviewers that things tend to really break down once your city gets bigger - particularly your supply chains, there become some real bottlenecks when your city gets large.Also there are some pathfinding errors that tend to multiply when the city gets large. By the time I am mining iron and building blacksmiths, I've run into serious growth problems. I am on try #4 now and I hope I get it this time.some tips:* keep your residential area in a single core, and try to build your farms and resource gathering (e.g., wood) on the outskirts. Use the residential desirability map to figure out where to build houses.* Grow SLOWLY. As you generate a source of each resource - e.g., wool - let it build a nice surplus before you add a weaver to turn it into cloth. * FOOD FOOD FOOD - nothing is worse than running out of food later in the game. So keep your food surpluses high and your food supply chains going* The river map is the coolest looking - but the hardest to use for growth. But you need water for fishing huts. So I recommend using the coastal map. 	----->	8

61849055	Needs a creative mode	----->	2
61849987	The entire game feels like it's trying to cater to a core idea, and I believe that the developers will stay dedicated to that core idea, however that core idea is residential organic growth.The residential growth system is you basically MS Paintbrush a zone out into your land and unemployed villagers will build shanty homes clustered within.Sometimes they build homes too close and get stuck.Sometimes they build the homes too far and now half of your residential zone is dedicated to a road.Sometimes they don't build anything and say there isn't enough room, when you can see they have it.There are many buildings that decrease desirability of a residential district so you are forced to keep homes away from buildings like warehouses and sheep farms, since villagers cannot automatically switch homes to a home closer to their place of work this can cause you to spend an unremarkable amount of time forcing people to change homes, or watch your tailor make 1 shirt and return home because it took him 3 hours to get to work.EDIT: I want to Clarify that the Devs have put out and update that claims to fix the main issue I myself had with the game's organic growth and will be changing my recommendation to yes, it's important that game developers listen to their consumers and refreshing that they did so, It's not a bad game for the price , just keep in mind the core idea weighs heavy on the gameplay, if you enjoy the idea the game is a solid town sim. Besides the terrifying non blinking villagers faces.	----->	15

61968340	Highly Recommend! For a game in Alpha, its still very well coded and I'm excited to follow this game into its development to see whats added to it. I think that in the future this is going to be a very well programmed City builder-  The game can have a bit of a learning curve to figure out what all the icons mean but the Discord is fairly active and very helpful. The Winter Preview update that has yet to be fully released from the time I'm writing this; adds a bunch of stuff that makes the game play even more enjoyable- This game to be was fully worth the $25 dollars I paid for it.	----->	6

While it is not yet perfect, it is clear that this is getting the TLC needed to transform it from a great idea with tons of fun into a true masterpiece of medieval city building. Fun, challenging, and always rewarding to play. Definitely recommend this title to anyone who likes sandboxes or city builder sims!	----->	20
62089453	It's still in development, therefore we need to distinguish between the game as it is and the game as it will/should be.Right now it's a pleasant, relaxing game about building a town, but that's all. So far it has no depth, it looks like developers got a great idea of organic building system, but then they realised they have no game to create around it.But it has potential. I hope that eventually the developers will add content and deepen all the roughly patched-up mechanics to create something great.	----->	5

62158167	I found this game and was reminded of the city building in Black and White 2 when I read that it was gridless. I wasn't disappointed, you can build some really cool towns and buildings in this game!Foundation is a lot more strategic than it may look at first. When I'm deep into building a town, sometimes more than half of my screen will be covered in different windows to be able to plan out and manage everything that's going on. The game kind of breaks once your town gets big enough, though, with villagers walking all over the place without doing anything (it'd be nice if they automatically moved houses to one closer to their jobs, right now you would have to do it all manually), army quests are very broken, but in your favor, so it's just a good way to get some constant income, and some of the UI will take some time to figure out, but all in all, its an awesome game, its been scratching an itch I've had for years, and every update adds significant changes to the game.(also, I know this would probably be very complicated, but VR support would be amazing)	----->	17
62159654	This city builder stands out in a new wave of entries in the genre. I started playing this game fairly early on and I've been in love with it since. The mechanics can be a bit brutal and learning the best city planning techniques takes some time, but once it starts to come together the game is an absolute blast to play.If you decide to play this game you should be expecting to manage every citizen individually and to design production chains in every hex you build in. I have grown cities up to about 1000 villagers, which starts to drop FPS, in less than a quarter of the map and with about 20 man-hours of investment. If you can manage the city's resources and villagers well, I think you could push the population easily to 6000, and maybe even to 10000 if the city is highly efficient. You'll manage each of these citizens, their jobs, their churches, their markets, their luxuries, their necessities, individually. If you're looking for a beautiful, fun, in-depth resource management and city building game, I would recommend this before any other title I've played in the genre.	----->	7

62241471	Having looked for a chill city-builder, this is the first one that is able to keep my interest while playing.

62263537	So I've been playing for a while, and I gotta say, this game is a welcome challenge. A lot of the tutorials aren't step by step so I had to learn through trial and error. My largest town currently consists of 97 people and it's continually growing. I suggest not worrying about making your towns by grid, and focus on quick pathways and getting enough resources.The controls are easy and are the same in many games. Use your mouse buttons, wheel, and the arrow keys to move around the map. Use - + to decrease and increase speed while using the space bar to pause and unpause. Simple.The buttons that are along the top and bottom of the screen are great and stand out from each other, making them easy to remember. The only thing they need to do is consider letting the player resize the game window when in windowed mode. If using windowed mode with 1920x1080, the bottom bar of buttons will not show up. I also think the help menu needs more topics with more concise instructions. I recommend adding popular tips, tricks, and cheats to the help window. More detailed instructions on controls at the beginning of game would also help with negative reviews.There are some things they need to fix that don't really take away from the game, but would make the game more polished. The fences around the houses need to go. In rare instances I've had people leave my town because they couldn't return home due to them clipping with other fences connected to houses. The minimal gap between houses also needs to increase, while the space for the house itself needs to be decreased to just around the house. You can have large areas of residential paint, and no one will build there, and then other times, they build in the smallest areas. It can be infuriating, especially when trying to build by grid. That's why I recommend not doing that.I would really like to see terrain paint added to the game so instead of just dirt paths, we could have multiple roads. Oh, and stone platforms to flatten hills or go over water with the ability to put buildings on it. Speaking of buildings, I'd suggest adding a ramp to all doors just in case it's put on a steep hill.Overall, if you're looking for a more predictable city builder, I'd recommend Banished, but if you want a challenge with pretty graphics, complete freedom and a more natural feel to home placement, then this is the game for you. I highly recommend it, and can't wait for future content.	----->	23
62265298	Great game for down time, or with a group of friends yelling at one another over who hit who and ruined their shot. Neat additions to editor, and workshop maps keep the game fresh! 10/10 would slap my friends balls again.	----->	-2
62269989	So I have played this game for a few hours now and I feel I can add something through a review. I want to start off by saying that I absolutely love the game, the concept and style both being the selling points to me. The graphics are pleasing and the gameplay, albeit slightly more complicated to begin with, is intricate and detailed enough to make you want to keep playing- I'm far from bored with the game and I'm constantly anticipating how my city is going to progress. I feel with a lot of games like this there's a sense of stagnation once you've reached a certain point, but at least where I am now with the game I do not feel this is the same. Considering this game still has updates pending it's exciting to know that it's going to continue to develop. I will say however that there are a few parts of the game which are annoying such as house placements and seemingly lazy citizens, but these are definitely minor issues which I am sure will be rectified through later updates- it does not make the game unplayable. Another thing I found was there was no real tutorial. I know that for some people that's ideal (sometimes there can be nothing more tedious than having to click through a tutorial) but there are certain aspects, such as trade, that should be explained more through the game. There are a few quests that you are given, but in the most part you are left to your own devices to figure out the best way to develop your city. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as I have enjoyed the trial and error aspect and has allowed me to explore the different map types each time I've restarted the game because I found I made a few errors at the beginning. Overall I am thoroughly pleased with the game and I am going to continue to enjoy playing it. I recommend buying it, but recommend reading through some threads for tips and tricks about the best way to get started! 	----->	17

62289310	Shockingly good for an Alpha game. There's some rough edges of course, but as of 1.4 it's really fun already! I definitely can see the endgame, and I really care about my town and its denizens. 1.5 preview has also added some really great features and I can't wait to see this all grow and expand. Well done devs!	----->	12

62302127	I'm in love with this game for sure. managing the growth correctly is the main challenge for me and forces a bit of planning and patience and strategy which I enjoy. I can get invested in my ONE kingdom and make it look cool and operate efficiently. If you're looking for quick paced, instanced or scenario type gameplay, this probably isn't what you're looking for.The military aspects are lacking but that doesn't bother me at all, i don't want to be stressing over too many things and getting overwhelmed, I enjoy focusing primarily on the function and growth of my kingdom. The most recent update (haven't tried yet) introduces more military options and it still doesn't include getting raided by AI randomly so that's great IMO, if you're looking for a military based game this isn't it.Devs are listening to players and making significant and awesome changes (to be expected in early access I suppose) but the game is definitely playable and enjoyable. My only concern at the moment would be some bugs when it comes to your gold count. doesn't reflect accurately and depending what menu you're looking at it shows different values. not to mention it fluctuates so rapidly from -800 gold to +500 in seconds so its hard to get a read at your financial situation. Nothing they're not aware of I'm sure!Overall this game was exactly what I was looking for and I love it. Well worth the price even in early access. only goes up from here <3, thanks for the great game!	----->	25

62403091	I can truly recommend this game if you are looking for a relaxing, medieval city building game. I am still a novice in city building. This is actually my first game and I like it very much.  You start out with a small group of people and build the basics, and then expand from there. The developers are working hard to bring out new updates. The controls are something I had to get used to, but once I got the hang of it - no issues.At this point I have not encountered any more bugs. Developers are fast to fix those. Cannot wait for additional functionality for this game!	----->	3

62493741	User Interface is a little better, building controls still a little less accurate than i'd like. new features and items continue to get added and things feel better for the changes added +++Previous review: A Work in progress:Negatives:The interface is a little clunky and not always responsive.The game runs slightly slow on my laptop, but doesn't ever crash.Fewer issues than earlier versions (Not finished and the lack of tutorials will leave you looking online for help.) Short Tutorial now leaves you looking for where to or how to do somethings. The NPC's still run out of names too soon and the pathing need work still(gets stuck in a few situations)Figuring out the auto-snap off/on is an old feature they've given such a tiny switch that is a pain to click on. But somewhat helpful. Hotkey for the win here.Good:The way you can custom build things is nice.!The progression is fair to good.Settlements are fairly easy to keep alive.added: + the new mission screen is better than before. A mass select or quick pick team button might be nice.Neutral:You have to get a feel for building placement.OKAY new Maps! the added random map is sweet, it still gets really funky cheat sectors but it is better than just the 4 starter ones. (redacted: 4 map types and they never change.)	----->	5

62506604	A game to chill with. After many years of Piracy the first game ever i decided to buy was this (after trying out pirated alpha of course). But i kinda felt that this project is the one to try. Needs polishing, but this is so far the best calm and not annoying experience of city building i had in years. The absence of fights and necessity to control army gives a chance to build a better city and leave pc whenever needed.  Keep up the good work, smart people.	----->	10

62537124	27-01-2020  Game is still in AlphaYes, the game already looks very charming, the updates have been steady and slowly introduces new elements to the game, so far the devs have shown progress between updates and giving sneak peeks at their work which really help the feeling they are busy with the game and listen to feedback. The game is not too hard to learn and that might be the only thing missing at the moment, something that will really challenge the die hard survival townbuilder gamers. Plus side to that is you can spend hours to make it look pretty!	----->	-3

62545387	Quick review time. This game is excellent for you medieval city sim builders out there. The biggest difference with Foundation is its more relaxing than other sims. You don't need to worry about death, disease, or disaster. It's more about focusing on providing the basic needs of your people as they level up which gives you access to more buildings and decorations. It's girdless and the only buildings you don't manually place are homes. You plot the residential areas and can increase the desirability of these areas to promote growth by placing churches, markets, decorations, etc. I love the organic home growth this game has. It gives every village you build a certain type of beauty. It also has a nice trade route system built in. Took me a little time to really grasp exactly how I should do things but with a little research and some sim knowledge, I picked up it fairly quickly. I'm excited to see where this game goes after full release. I highly recommend playing this game. It's worth every penny.	----->	20
62551914	Caveat emptor.. This is sill a bit rough if you play on a shovel like mine (it's not even good enough to be at toaster). However when i did get it going finally it was very enjoyable. When i get a better Computer I expect i will like it even more!	----->	9

62655350	I've spent 35 hours playing this game since i got it a few months back.  Must say the progress was slow at first and i was having doubts if the Dev's would have kept going, They they released a few major updates and the game is Definitely improving and can see the progress that is being done.  A little slow for my taste but am enjoying the game nonetheless.Just a few things that are a bit of a pain is it can be easy to miss the Envoy missions as you now have to wait for him to show up and you can sometimes miss the notification that he is waiting there until it is stoo late and he is no longer clickable.  You should be able to at least still click on him and get his mission before he leaves the bounds of the map.  I really wish there was an easy way of seeing all your townsfolk's wants and needs in a type of graph so we can focus on those needs as clicking on each Resident to see their wants/needs and what has been fulfilled Can't wait to see how the game develops further, It definitely has a lot of potential to be an aweomse Supply & Demand City Builder.	----->	5
62666250	The game is already very enjoyable in pre-release even if it is still quite buggy and unfinished in its current Alpha state. It's an unpolished gem but a gem nevertheless. I have yet to encounter any game-breaking bugs and the bugs that do exist can be either worked around or ignored. Some features are still missing their full functionality but they show the game has a lot of promise, as it's fun to play even with some features missing!	----->	2
62672950	I like it 	----->	2
62681365	A relaxing city builder, if your looking for more combat etc. probably better looking somewhere else but otherwise this is a great game, but from time to time you can still tell the game is being worked on. There are a few issues to do with balancing, your villages eventually get some strange numbering system like they are part of some bleak prison system, and especially in the late game there seems to be some weird stock problem as my village hit that wonderful 500+ population achievement all my stocks went from 1000+ to just struggling to stay afloat.However overall I would recommend this game! you can easily sick 80+ hours into which makes it a great price for what you get, and building some slightly over the top monuments is great!*Please be aware this may all utterly change in 6 months from now*	----->	6

62696160	I've spent multiple fun and interesting hours building up my village and the micro management seemed to work brilliantly. As so many others have stated, after around 100 citizens the whole thing turns into a great pit of depression. Suddenly the citizens' needs spiral out of control and all the production lines stop working. Items don't make it to the market, people complain about not having space for houses (when there's loads) and immigrants just stop showing up when the only solution would be more human power. It seems like there are some serious problems when it comes to bigger villages. It happens to every village, no matter how you try to make it different.However, it is an early access, so I have high hopes it'll get better with time. So far the gaming experience before the dark times is very much enjoyable, the art style cute and general idea entertaining. The UI is pretty awful (boxes spawning outside the screen, bad translations, etc.) but I'm sure that too is a work in progress.There's still loads to fix, but the developers are on the right track. I think I've got my money's worth just with the starting point, now the next step would be able to get pass 100 citizens! I hope in the future there would be more options for difficulty and a bit more help during gameplay wouldn't hurt nobody! It's hard to say if I'd recommend the game at this point or not, but for me it has been fun nevertheless. So if you're looking for something more finished, wait. If you're fine with alpha gameplay, I see no problem why not!	----->	15

62739549	I came to this game after playing Banished, which is a great city builder/survival game.  Foundation has a similar theme, but a different take on the implementation.  Foundation is medieval, where Banished is early modern without mods.  The biggest plus is the organic city building.  No longer are your cities forced into an inorganic grid.  I hope that this game adds some more of the aspects of Banished, such as more crop types, better traders, and more things to balance in your city other than just food and happiness, but for an alpha game, this is great.	----->	6

62755791	Great game, great concept and a great new update.It deserves to be played. But at the same time no matter how hard one plays this game or learns its mechanics, Foundations seems to have an inevitable breakdown after 200 citizens in which the game stops working properly, immigration refuses to work regardless of ample residential space, 96+ happiness and full employment. The late game is so underdeveloped it leaves the player frustrated. This game needs a new update ASAP.I can see you all care about the game, so this is what I would keep in mind from my experience for future dev:The game needs work on food production, there needs to be lakes on the hills map and another early game food alongside berries for newcomers would make the game go smoother.Late game is where the fun is really at so thats where your attention needs to be now. Markets should be able to have a granary style building called a storehouse that can be placed nearby. A huge problem with foundations late game is supply management.Residential system is nice! Just wish it worked properly and space could be used effectively. TAVERNS!!! Make it possible for people to spend free-time sitting in there without buying anything.And for the love of god make hunting more effective.	----->	17

This game get continously very strong updates, it's wonderful to look at it hwo it dvelops and it's a great city builder if you are not interested in fights and wars. It has mostly good balanced systems for goods and ressources already, it's challenging when your village develops step by step into a city, you have a lot of managing to do, but there is always time to just watch this game in all its beauty. can't wait for release, which should be close by now	----->	12

62840432	Very Fun city builder. I found it challenging. Make sure to really study where to have your settlement start off. Try not to get ahead of yourself grow as needed and think forward to what your people will need next. Keeping enough money in the bank to expand and build while still keeping enough supplies for your folks. I found that moving villagers around jobs will help you, you don't have to keep them in one job. Although they do level up in each career you can manage them to go back when new villagers arrive. All in all its hours of fun to grow your medieval town into a thriving community.	----->	7

62881167	Foundation is exactly what I've always hoped for from a builder game.  There's no need to micro manage anything. Focus on the big goals, and let the villagers figure out all the micro on their own. That doesn't mean you can't micro, just that you don't have to. Add to that the ability to teak every little detail of your big buildings, churches, keeps, markets, and you're organically building your own fantasy kingdom. I'd really like to see other games that take advantage of player-built cities and kingdoms. Perhaps in an RPG, or a Grand Strategy game.	----->	7

62889647	Love the game ! Makes me remember banished which was good too !The feeling and ambiance really gets me. The organic sense of the buildings is well done.I know it is still early access but I feel that I have to point that out.There are some bugs, one I found to be a little disappointing was that I had over 150 clothesbut still couldn't manage to build anything that requires them. I had a map with no water but couldstill build a Fisherman's hut anywhere. I didn't know exactly when things were due; When is the leveling window supposed to come ? What is really available in the trade system? What do the scholars do ? What is unlocked by what ?This game surely has a great potential. I will definitely play more !	----->	4
62893203	Extremely fun game. Not only is it amazing right now with plenty of content to keep you busy for hours, anyone can see that it has great potential for the future. The Winter Preview update showed us just how much more these devs can improve and add to the game, with them adding a much more intricate military system. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game, and for the sake of that and to support the devs, I encourage city builder lovers to pick up this game so that we can see what this game becomes.	----->	19
62894958	Great fun Game	----->	4

62918461	For a game thats still in early access with a few quirks, I'm loving every second of it!	----->	2
62930798	          I like the overall concept of the game, but I wish there was an information handbook of some kind. I had to learn the mechanics of the game just by trial and error, which took awhile. I'm still learning and probably will have to start yet another game because I learned something new once more. It's an ongoing process, proper placement is the key. I need to find how to navigate the map, like locating an overhead view and a zoom feature.	----->	5
62935607	It's very frustrating when you try to do something only to find your people are no longer happy and you have no idea what you can do to fix it.  Throw us a bone and give a hint or something to help.  Once it's too low there seems to be no way to fix it.  Nice game but I want to spend more time building and growing the city then micro managing every aspect of the people and their happiness!	----->	0
62937212	super fun to play. its so cool watching your village grow with a bit of randomness like house placement. beautiful graphics too. have had only one bug with villegers not spawning in but thats it 9/10 would recommend.	----->	13

62950069	I sat down. 8 hours later, I was still playing. This is objectively the best game of the sub-genre.	----->	3
62951457	I personally think that sim games should give a short tutorial but this game throws you right in with nothing but a quick menu of how to's. This is why I'd say that the first few moments of the game were a bit tedious, learning how functions worked (and the arrangement of icons were a bit mind-boggling to me).  But, one the game started out full swing, it seemed more and more smooth to play and the game started to grow on me. Definitely excited to see where this goes as a game, maybe see if there are more to play with in regards to the military aspect... I'd recommend for those who like slow-burn Sim Games	----->	7

62964778	Ok now this game is really taking shape. The winter update made villagers look for nearer homes from their workplace, which was a must. I've played lots of city-making games, including Banished and alike, but this one is getting ahead by far.If you like mods, there is a handful.The only thing that is still a MUST, as I see, is a FARTHER ZOOM OUT or MAP VIEW option. This really needs to kick in.Besides that, honestly can't find anything to criticize at this point, besides the old-stylish UI which could eventually be upgraded	----->	0

62976697	Likes:  Fun, beautiful, engaging city builder game.  I enjoyed puzzling through the supply chains, designing my own churches/forts etc, and watching my city grow organically.  The grid-less style makes the game feel very natural. Your city is partly designed by you, but also grows it's own personality as you continue to acquire new resources and complete missions.Dislikes: some aspects of the game could use more depth, such as the leveling system, decorations, military management etc.  Game feels short...after you've built one city up to about 100 villagers or so there isn't much left unseen in the game.  a few bugs too, nothing too bad.  I feel like these are fixable problems as we continue to see more updates.	----->	0
62980840	Great city building game.  Lots of fun playing around with the different maps and mods are adding to the fun. Couple of things I hope they address in future updates like houses building too close together (they can be deleted and it will build elsewhere if room permits} and being able the see your army in a different window instead of having to click back and forth to see who is wounded, training etc.	----->	8

62989846	I am greatly enjoying the game, but I have noticed that after a bit of progression into the game my people get themselves stuck and i cant figure out where they are to get them out. they also stopped working in their places of work so they all starved.. since i cant build the roads myself it becomes a problem. I am also running into an issue where the villagers are no longer getting names and just get Village#1234 or something along those lines, that isn't an issue since it is just a name but thought i would mention that as well.overall i would recommend this game, I just hope they fix these issues im running into because without fail i have these issues each time i start up a new game	----->	0
62994903	This game makes me wish there were more games like it to play while it goes through early access.	----->	3
62995078	I have really enjoyed my time so far.  I have played full releases that were less polished.  After a dozen or so hours I have had one crash. The tutorial is pretty good though some things that I think they felt were obvious I found not so easy.  Still having problems building walls for instance.  The trade system is pretty basic at this point hoping it opens up later.  Looking forward to seeing how this develops but I already feel I got my money's worth and this will probably be my time waster for the present.	----->	7
62998396	Recommended, but with consideration. Pro: This is one of the most atmospheric game I've ever played. Contra: It's really far from finished, though it's great, there are a great deal of polish to be done. When finished this will be an absolute masterpiece, but it's not finished.	----->	3
63000945	Wasn't sure on the price, but bought two copies for me and a friend for his birthday. 4 hours vanished in laughter, fun and screaming at each other. Every minute spent in this game reveals more and more layers of tactics, both for the Spy and the Sniper.If you have a friend to jump in on this with - I cannot recommend this enough. I expected this to rise up the ranks of my most played games fairly damn quick.	----->	0
63012012	If you've ever wanted a relaxing version of an age of empires game, this is it. Really nice style and going through your little villages when they're all set up is super fun. Very much an early build of the game with some messages showing code, very generic dialogue, but none of that stops it from being an immensely relaxing and fun experience. Can't wait till this game gets more fleshed out.	----->	9

63021521	I do recommend this game it is a wonderful little city builder with a good amount of detail. It looks good zoomed in and zoomed out. My only gripe is the lack of tutorial. I had to go onto youtube to figure out some of the features. Keep in mind this is a game that is essentially in works. May get a tutorial later. I will update this review upon full release.	----->	10

63032999	In my opinion, this is one of the best games you will find in its genre, and it's still in early access!The modular construction of churches, keeps, manor houses and monasteries is super cool. You can make them small and utilitarian, or grand and monumental. The way that settlers make roads and houses seems very organic, or natural. I really like it.If you boil it down, it's just a resource management city builder game, but hot damn they do it well!There are also some really great mods, and they encourage people to make and share mods.If you enjoy this type of game, it's well worth the price.A few tips for beginners:If you are trying to buy something through the trader, make sure you have the good assigned to a warehouse or granary.Promote as many newcomers to serfs as you want, but beware promoting too many serfs to commoners or commoners to citizens at once. You'll likely drop happiness because you won't have sufficient housing (citizens are fussy and want high value land) or you won't have enough goods/luxury goods or markets.Granaries and warehouses need to be close to the buildings that produce the goods you're storing in them. The further your transporters have to walk, the more likely you are to have supply chain issues. Hungry people are not happy.Have 4/4 transporters in your granaries and warehouses. Market sellers don't stock their markets with food or goods, transporters do. Transporters supply wood to coal burners, iron ore to smelters, wheat to mills, cloth to tailors, etc. Transporters are probably the most important workers in the game.People don't want to walk far to work. You may think you have sufficient housing. You may have painted huge swathes of land green for residential areas, but if you have some stuck up citizens that can't find a high value area to build a house near their jobs, it's going to tell you that you don't have enough housing for X amount of people. Until you solve your housing crisis, you aren't going to attract new immigrants.In the list of residents (which you can find at the bottom left corner), each person will have a face that shows you if they are happy or not. Click on the resident and you can look at what needs aren't fulfilled and try to solve your crisis.The monastery requires dorms to function. One of the extensions ( I believe it is extension D ) is a dormitory, but it doesn't tell you that. You won't be able to produce grapes, wine, herbs or honey without dorms.It looks really cool, but, a large stone bridge has an INSANELY high upkeep cost. If you find your economy plummeting shortly after building one, you may want to get rid of it.Build lots of manor houses and wooden keeps. They increase the land value around them and they can be assigned as treasuries, which will raise your maximum gold value. You will need the extra gold if your economy goes ass over tea kettle and you can't figure out why.	----->	32

63033694	It's a fun game with a lot of promise as long as the devs keep up with the bug fixes. As far as things ive noticed that need attention are when i build a big enough lord manor or church etc, The window wont let me scroll down far enough to see the last item, which usually ends up being the core so i cant give it a function, and my army never seems to heal no matter what. A little more tutorial in the beginning instead of a help box I think would be more appealing, for things such as the painting of residential, extraction etc. I would love to see more to this game and for it being early access I do find it a great deal of fun and I think the idea and what the developers were going for has hit the nail on the head, we just need to be patient and let the game keep developing.Cheers	----->	18

63045096	What makes this city builder great is hard to pinpoint. There's something a bit magical about the particular combination of your influence the way the AI builds the city. This city-builder feels the least like managing a machine that I've come across in ages. The pacing is smooth and engaging and it's genuinely rewarding to watch the town grow and flourish. I'm loving this game so far.	----->	8

The games is awesome and I look forward to playing more of it. I would suggest some sort of tutorial at the beginning of the game to walk you through the controls. That took some time for me to figure out most of them, and I still haven't found them all yet.	----->	12
63099162	New Review...I finally have the mods working (not all), This is a great game and is fun to build a medieval city. I like the way it looks and the production flow...and it's simple and not a complex-city (<<<see ha ha I did there).  Thanks for a great game with or without mods!I would recommend this game...however, since the release of the game...the system for using mods has been problematic and troublesome.  I cannot enjoy using them because of either how they download or not being able to unzip the folders or whatever....too bad. (other games are simple and easy). The game itself is fine and lots of fun.	----->	22
63100528	Foundation is fun medieval city management game. While it is still in early access it already has a lot of content that I get lost in optimizing. I am still figuring out some of the mechanics but in general al mechanics are quite self explanitory and easy to figure out while playing the game. It is great for some laidback gaming after coming home from a long day of work. The only issue I have is the occasional crashes at higher populations. This, however, is not enough to not recommend the game as you can just reload a save and continue playing.	----->	9

63119695	Fantastic builder.  Has the freedom I've always wanted from some of the classics as far as placement.  I love the desire paths your townspeople make.  The game in it's current state is already very addicting, I certainly don't regret purchasing early access as I have enjoyed myself immensely.  I'd love to see the finished product as the devs have certainly given themselves a fantastic foundation (no pun intended) to build upon.  The addition of a map edit, terrain generator, unlockable building styles/customizations as your town progresses through time, more in depth trading and adding friendly/hostile mobs would be absolutely fantastic and fit right into the environment.  The addition of a campaign mode would be wonderful as well, although I honestly don't mind playing in sandbox if there are no plans for such a mode.	----->	19

63135704	Feels natural, city growth more closely emulates how a real town would develop over time. Very relaxing to play and intuitive to pick up, Give the game a little more substance though, a story line or a campaign to play. 4.5/5 would recommend	----->	4
63135745	IMO one of the best city-building game even-though it's still in early access. 47 hours in and i'm still enjoying it, trying out different maps, strategies for survival, creative building and hoping to unlock all the achievements.While it has elements of a typical city-building game, the concept as a whole is quite fresh.Gridless gameplay - makes your city look and feel organic, also sorta realistic i supposeCustomization - Has good variety of customization for important structures like churches, manor, monastery, keep, market, bridges etc. The ability to create your own Unique building and add on to it in the future is very satisfying.Chaos - NPC (villagers) actually have control authority of their own as they will decide on the orientation,type of houses and location where they want to build their houses withing the zoning u provide. This adds to the level of uncertainty where you'll never know exactly how your town would ended up look like.I've yet to encounter any major bugs thus far. Although it's not a perfect game yet, the  ̶f̶o̶u̶n̶d̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶  basis is strong enough to add more layers onto it and i hope to see this game succeed.For fans of city-building games this is a must-buy.	----->	27
63136445	This is one of the better city builder games.  It takes a bit of time in order to understand the nature of how to build a functioning city that not only grows, but provides you with the funds to expand into new territories.The technology tree is profession based, and each type of storable product is part of a chain of raw materials and then finished product.  An example is a wheat farm, then a flour miller then a baker, or an iron mine > coal producer > smelter > blacksmith (for tools) weaponsmith (for weapons).I enjoyed it very much, and I actually completed all achievements, something which I don't usually care about.Don't forget that you have a job, family, need to eat and should often bathe and use the toilet.  This game will make you miss appointments, damage your relationships, and take sick days off of work!Good luck!	----->	-3

63181451	To put something clear, I use the main launcher and not steam. I dont know how many hours I have, but I have all the factions maxed out..... that should be be a nuff said as to back what im about to say.THE GAME....IS NOT.....PAY TO !@#%$#@ WIN... It puts you with players of your PS and rank untill you get between rank 25 or 30 in the main faction, its new players that run into other new players that have bought a pack and got a bunch of new parts that then stomp the newbes who dont know the weakness of things.I can say with no doubt that theres a cheap and good counter to every build in this game under 1000 C which is not hard to come by if you do the grind or the missions...Now as for if you should pick up this game I would have to say you should only if your okay with doing some grind for the fun you can have, as of now with these new updates it has become about 3 times as easey to new parts and get a good ride within just a day of play.Some tips...Almost nothing is handed to you.Other players dont care about you.Dont ask for help if you dont understand something, instead just look online for the endless guilds on building and what not.Dont be a jackass to your team m8's and they wont remember to screw you over down the road. Unless your in a landship.Last thing I wish to say.DONT PUT FOR GOD (*@%$$&@#$&%&^%*$@%%$^$ GUNS ON PARTS THAT ARE NOT GUN FRAMES YEE @%#$#^@ GET M8!?	----->	6

63193016	Pretty solid city building/village game. Its like founders fortune, except more Macro and less Micro. It scales pretty big but not large map scale like Rise to Ruins. Which i hope to see SOMETHING similar in the future.More scenarios, multiple maps, some intense combat away from building.. Something more.A great start. For alpha, its really good. Can't wait to see what it becomes.7/10	----->	13
63193244	This game is extremely fun to play and I definitely recommend it for everyone who's interested in city building and resource managing. There are few bugs here and there that may interfere sometimes in your gameplay, but's expected since it's on early access stage. The DEV team is surely going to the right way to build an epic game. Let's support them to continue in this way.	----->	10

63196886	this is a really good game. i really cant see how someone could give it a bad review (youtube it for video play and stop being lazy). not going into depth review, just wanted to give it a thumbs up. fun and unique. plain and simple...	----->	3
63201345	Easy and simple game to get lost in, It lets you build your town your way without constant heckling from attackers. Some better and more in depth tutorials and guidelines would be more helpful when learning to play.	----->	1

63217649	Excellent game, the tutorial is lacking when you start, but overall it is not too complicated.  It seems to be very well thought out, and while this genre seems to have plenty to choose from, this is a little gem with features that I have never seen before.  I really do like the way you have to balance growth with stability, and balancing new immigrants with food production.  There is a nice variety of structures to build and the game plays out in a very slow pace, which is great for this type.  I love the design decision to include building your own custom buildings, such as keeps, manors and taverns.  Overall, excellent game in it's current state, and can't wait to see what the future holds.  Totally recommended.	----->	16
63221356	I'm usually hesitant to jump on early access games but i will say i'm glad i did with this game. The developers are very active with updating the game and making it a better experience. Even in the games current state i think its well worth the money.	----->	6
63225858	Still lots of things that need to be worked on, but as of now the game feels largely complete. It is a relaxing rather than challenging experience, where you can sculpt a beautiful middle age town and various monuments.	----->	3

63244679	There is definitely a learning curve with this game, and some minor frustrations regarding the villagers not seeming to fulfill their needs properly despite having plenty of resources to do so, but the game is incredibly charming and fun which really does make up for the things that make me want to hold back any.Highly recommend this title - Maybe it's just me, but it's pretty relaxing and low-key most of the time. An easy simulation game to lose myself into, and the graphics and art design are fantastic.Hopefully in future updates we can get some more names added into the database.	----->	14

63253544	This game is an excellent village and resource manager, there's some B&W2 feel to it which is nice. Its not stressful, this isn't banished and its not as complex as simcity.The game in its current state is playable, some functionality of buildings isn't there yet but you can still create full production lines to meet the needs of the different levels of society and get creative in your layout of the town kinda like Anno.My only critique is the UI, its simple and fast but as you progress and things get alittle complicated there's no filter options for resources and it feels lacking etc, no biggie really.if you enjoyed banished or black and white this is worth picking up.Note: there is no combat, soldiers are assigned to a barracks and can sent on missions, you don't see or influence the outcome beyond training and equipping them prior, the game does some math based on what you send for the mission and get you get a result back.	----->	8
63254499	It seems to be a dead game. I've had it since launch an barring the first month no one really plays. I'm assuming it's because the price is kinda insane.	----->	-4

63289947	I wasn't sure what to think of this game at first and I was very hesitant about buying it right now due to all the reviews.  After 16 hours of game play, I would say that I really enjoy this game and would recommend it.  The only major problem I have that made me almost reluctant to leave a good review was the lack in tutorial.  You do have a help box you can look at in game but it still doesn't show you enough and I found myself spending more time on tutorials on youtube than actually playing the game.  But after many videos and patience I finally understand the mechanics and really like it :)	----->	4
63298829	I like it, it just has a lot of minor frustrating issues.	----->	0
63300354	In one sentence: It's really fun. I was following development of this game for a year before deciding to buy it. Mostly to support developers who are doing amazing job with constant updates. And you can really see how this game grows and evolves. I really hope it will become everything developers want it to be, and more. It's already enjoyable at this stage, it can provide you with hours of fun. Though with every update I expect gameplay to grow and change. Some things are really rough around the edges, but that's to be expected during alpha. Worth buying to support amazing devs and to get great game once the project is done.	----->	18

63302092	Very enjoyable little game, much like the Anno series. Lots of micromanaging the villagers to where they can live and what they do for work. For sure check it out if you are a fan of the city building genre.Cons: -UI is a bit awkward-There is a lack of information on the intricacy of the game, so lots of guessing how things work at this point-Villagers seem to build in places that do not make sense ( had them build in low desirable spot in middle of buddy's wheat field, when there was plenty of average-very high room to build that was open. -monastery only accepts males, and must have dorms, and you cannot assign which jobs they take inside ( cannot find any info in game on this)-church cannot assign a priest ( I promoted a guy to prier but no idea what he does )-Army training and healing is not explained wellPros : super addicting, very charming, still in early development with no where to go but up, and it is already very good	----->	11
63302354	A fun and relaxing city builder with good depth, but not a micromanaging headache. Its got a lot of things to do and a lot of decorative options to create splendid churches, castle and manors, especially for only being in alpha. It can be a bit of a learning curve the first time time around, but you will quickly get the hang of it.Would definitely recommend for someone looking for a nice city builder to chill with.PS. selling shirts is king.	----->	15

Still in early access, but feature complete enough to be playable and if they stopped development right now it would be worth the cost, but there is no indication that development won't continue forward.  Deep, challenging, beautiful, would definitely recommend.	----->	3
63319190	For a game that's so rough and solidly in early-access development phase, Foundation is shockingly playable. A lot of the current game mechanics are incomplete, opaque, or downright confusing, but the city building aspect  is both relaxing and intriguing enough that those flaws lead to amused bafflement rather than rage-quitting frustration. Like I still can't figure out why my citizenry seem to demand 3X the amount of clothing as any other resource (maybe the nobles burn outfits after each use??? if so, fair), but a naked citizenry will still build you a stunning monastery on a seaside cliff so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯[b]DON'T Buy In Early Access[/b]: If you want polished city builder where the fun is in managing your resources and supply chains and building up an army to defend your city. This is no Pharaoh/Caesar (...yet). [b]DO Buy In Early Access:[/b] If your favorite part of Banished is relaxing into the music and designing a city that blends in with the landscape. If you loved city-building in Lionhead's Black and White you will be delighted by Foundation.	----->	18

It is fun, peaceful, & a sweet city-builder.	----->	9
63357827	This is a game where you start playing and then realise 8 hours later that you forgot to eat. Very relaxing! The housing mechanic is a bit tough to work out where they need more space, ideally could there be a 'need' layer to show where space is tight?Also wish that the interface was a bit more pretty on 4k... even with interface scaling up it's still too small and looks like Windows 95 v2 :(Overall though, freaking brilliant game I love it	----->	11
63359926	I recently came back to this game having discovered it pretty soon after its release, and it's growing really nicely. Super relaxing game, lots of charm to it.

63403468	Foundation is a very engaging game, especially considering it's still in alpha-stage. The way the economy and the happiness-rating works is quite smooth. There are some rough edges, but the main gameplay is good. Took some time to get in to the way things work, so I'd definitely recommend checking some online beginner guides early on.The game offers little to no help in this aspect. I tried hitting my head on the wall twice before going to the guides for help - the game became quite a lot more enjoyable after understanding the basics. My third city is soon at 150 pop and growing, beginning to have all the options open and now its just scaling up from here on.It's a shame the maps are so limited and fixed. Hoping to see improvement in this area. Would love to try starting on random maps. Also, user defined keybindings are sorely needed. And mouse-dragging the map, this feature has become standard in games like this, it's rather tedious to use keyboard for scrolling around.Anyway, overall a very enjoyable experience. Thoroughly recommended for citybuilder fans.	----->	11

63490926	I bought this because I liked the idea of an organic, gridless village building game.It turns out that it is also a comfortable and zen building experience too. I have not delved into conflict and hegemony. I have spent my time cultivating a small town that is self sufficient and inviting. My villagers spend their days working. They take downtime to enjoy some bread and visit the local church. I used to enjoy the violence of first person shooters after a long stressful day. But this is just as cathartic. My villagers have names and dreams. They have wants, but they are patient.This game is a soft whisper after a day of toil. I am looking forward to watching it develop.	----->	3

63652771	It has an amazing Foundation in place, but certainly needs plenty of polish before it's full release.  It has a rough, frustrating and not very helpful UI, balancing issues - if you have any experience in the genre you will dominate your playthrough, minor gameplay bugs/glitches and lots of stuff that just feels like place holders and/or early works in progress.  I absolutely loved the gridless building system and the AI creating roads and building their own homes - it makes the world feel so much more alive than most city builders.  There is plenty of room for being creative with building large structures like castles, churches and strongholds as well.  Supply chains and population tiers will remind you of Anno 1800 in a good way.Highly recommend the purchase if you're okay with the struggles that come with early access and also okay with being disappointed if they don't make major improvements any time soon, highly recommend waiting for the full release if you're not.	----->	17
63658935	Very good game with a very unique concept.Development is unfortunately quite slow, but there is some and it is going into a good direction. It is already a good game which i would recommend to buy if you are interested, although it is still in beta.	----->	11

63692435	I really enjoy this game in its current state and I expect to see even better things moving forward. Its not tropico 6 but its not meant to be. On its own its great and entertaining. I wish I could turn of a few things that stop it from progressing so I could leave it on at night. Heck I'd like to leave it run in the back ground while I work. I like to see how the people progress on their own and would even like this game to run 24/7I recommend starting a game and just building everything and watching how the parts all work and move . don't get to invested in your first two games. Then create a new game and take your time. Right now I have a section for military and production. I mean this game really lets you get creative.	----->	15

63723827	[i]Reviewed in Early Access Alpha.[/i]At first glance, Foundation looks like a zillion other mediaeval city builders. A different art style to, say, Banished, and it does look gorgeous, but not much different. Look deeper, however, and it's fundamentally different in gameplay.Most obviously, it's feudal: although there's a temptation to promote everyone to citizenship as fast as possible, that's a good way to collapse your village's economy and have everyone unhappy and starving. Keep serfs toiling away as serfs forever if they produce food, and you're more likely to succeed. Imagine there's a bloody revolution in the future where the workers are enfranchised and then play.More subtly, the organic placement of buildings and gridless system has a concrete effect on [i]how[/I] the game plays. There is no optimal size of a field, nor ratio of miners to weaponsmiths and coal burners. They all depend on how far their workers' homes are, and how long it takes them to walk to the nearest market, well or church. This makes it impossible to just look proportions up on a wiki and plan accordingly, instead the game requires you to pay attention to your workers' behaviour and optimise life for them. Making your village more efficient is equivalent to making your villagers' work-life balance better.The game also emphasises creativity over restrictions when it comes to building. As long as your villagers can access a building's entrances, you can clip things as much as you like, hiding one functional building inside another if you want. Some people don't like it, but I do.It's Early Access, and that shows: the core gameplay is there, but there are a few things missing. Right now, the UI is horrid, but the developers are sensibly doing other gameplay stuff rather than wasting time on a UI that is going to change. Some might want to wait for further developments, particularly if vision is an issue.One thing I'd very much like fixed is that all the villagers are pasty white. It doesn't reflect mediaeval Europe, doesn't allow for the many non-white villages that existed, and doesn't reflect the audience of the game.	----->	1

63747390	Really enjoy this game but - it's a little disappointing that it still isn't finished. Seems a bit buggy for a $30 price tag. Gameplay kind of trails off and becomes less enjoyable once you unlock all that you can - military missions become repetitive, setting up successful trade routes is a little confusing, and the tutorials provided are very brief and skip over important details. I wish it was easier to get food from production buildings to your villagers who need it - it feels awkward when you have a bunch of food being produced with villagers still starving. I do enjoy how organic town development feels and I like that certain buildings can be custom designed. I love how big and sprawling your town can become - the maps are HUGE. Can't wait until this game is finished!	----->	15

63781429	I think to begin with it's worth saying that I think that the price is a little steep for the game as it currently is. BUT in saying that, I can see much potential for the game and I believe that when it is out of early access it will be fully worth the price, which is why I am recommending. It's a good city builder, I like the graphics and the basic concept and even though it is quite basic at the moment, it's still quite addicting. From looking at the game road map, I think that lots of important and exciting updates are incoming and therefore the game will keep improving. I'm excited to see the direction that this game takes.There are a few bugs and a few things in game that don't really make sense, but I think these are being ironed out as it goes through early access so it is perhaps to be expected. I think when steam workshop is introduced, this game will improve greatly.	----->	19

63785541	One of the best indie games by far.A lot of activity in the development. Very promising. A few bugs to be looked at in the developer forum though.	----->	3
63789127	This game is not finished - yet playable and enjoyable.It is a medieval city building game with a focus on designing a beautiful environment with working construction chains. There is little challenge when compared to other games that have base building. You don't struggle that hard to survive, you don't have to build an army to conquer the world.This is just a beautiful game that lets you build a town, idle, relax.There is little time pressure to do anything. So enjoy.It is also not a game that lets you overly obsess about the buildings or environment design like theme park games. It has a small variety of crafting options and that's fine.For the current price it is a little expensive I think, The state of the game is promising though and I think it will be worth the money in the longer run. If you don't mind playing a game that lets you see variables and some minor graphic glitches, and especially if you can't wait for release and want to support a game, then I recommend you buy it.	----->	10

63841308	This is fun to play with friends. Single player campaign falls a little flat not much action or twists to the story but over all good gameplay. Mulitiplayer is more toxic than MW3 on xbox 360 I've never been bullied more. Would Recommend	----->	5
63842126	Some of the best graphics I have seen. Kudos to developers.After adding a few more hours, I could see some minor bugs like Soldiers getting stuck in the keep, dorms not being occupied if they are built after recruitment.I feel the bigger problem is the villagers automatically stop immigration after a few hours even if they have access to goods, food everything. Maybe it is just me, but there are no proper suggestions on where you should concentrate when you are drowning. None the less, you need to play the game for the graphics alone.	----->	-1
63845150	Great little middle ages city builder. Nice and pretty in its own cartoon-ish way. If you like Settlers, you would like this game. Very minor bugs and some room for improvement there. Overall a great use of 29 hours and a few bucks. Once this game gets a major overhaul / update I would come back and play again. For now, I have tapped out the gameplay and will move on.	----->	10
63852307	Building is fun, Some controls could be explained a little bit better and the importance of cloth and tools should not be taken for granted. Still very fun!	----->	4

63960358	I'd definitely give this game 4 out of 5 stars it's one of the best feudal city builders i've ever played. The customization of the lords manners the churches and everything else is amazing. It does have little problems where characters get stuck going places or where armies get stuck when they're forming but saving and reloading fixes it 90% of the time. I hope in the future they add the ability to select a lord or something when you start your village and customize him or her to your liking and then add the ability to promote citizens into lords.	----->	4

63969746	Fun game if you enjoy laid back sandbox city building games. Beautiful visuals and landscapes, spent most of my time just beautifying my city progressing slowly. Love the idea of being able to custom build some of the buildings like church/tavern etc. Only slight downside of it is that the house buildings and workers pathing are all done by the AI, which sometimes could interfere with your city planning, aesthetically at least. Would like to see if some form of controls of house building/pathing can be added in the future. Would also like to see terraforming features added as currently some buildings (ie markets) will partially submerge into the ground when building on slopes.	----->	6

64012962	one of the best early access games i've purchased - if you like city builders with a focus on resource chain management (banished, rimworld, etc) then you'll love this. it is a game in early stages nonetheless and as such suffers from a few noticeable flaws (bad ui, couple funny lines of text that shouldn't be there, and a bit needlessly complicated in some aspects of gameplay), but still, easy to sink hours and hours in if you like the genre, and i personally can't wait to see what this game becomes after each update.	----->	13

Enjoying the mellowness and challenge of just making it easy for people to walk to work though.	----->	-1

64099027	This game is still in early access and I can tell; however, in the state it's in right now I am very much enjoying it. It is a lot more complicated than face value. It took me three games to finally understand the true intricacies of the game. My chief complaint are the maps. Not a huge fan of the set up. I'd really like to see procedural map generation. I think it would be a great addition to the game.	----->	13

64168846	- Probably one of the best games of the genre in the all gaming market.-  Easy to get into alone or with friends and really hard to master. There's a competitive scene if you're into that as well with seasonal leagues and events across the year. - The community is great and provides support with all sort of guides and manuals. You sure won't be disapointed to get deep into their mechanics as the skill ceiling is high and pays off in the end.- The price is a bit high for the average consumer but considering how unique and rich this game is I'd say it is pretty reasonable.- Also, if you find yourself waiting for someone to play with, check out the Discord channel, there's always someone eager to teach you some moves and test their snipper skills. We never know when the next prodigy will show up.	----->	12

64272468	Honestly the fun in this game is just building your town from the ground up and shaping it to a big city that will be able to support a huge population, that's pretty much it. There's really ain't much to do other than repeated food/army quest and unlocking other buildings to make your city even bigger. Difficulty comes in the form of satisfying every one of your villagers, if a handful of them leaves they can seriously mess up your city's production and economy, It will be a domino effect from there and can be hard to recover, you're just better off just starting from scratch again. Fun game but don't know if it's worth the asking price for now and the game still needs a bit of polish, but it's highly playable.	----->	10

64283219	The Rwandan genocide, also known as the genocide against the Tutsi,[3] was a mass slaughter of Tutsi, Twa, and moderate Hutu in Rwanda, which took place between 7 April and 15 July 1994 during the Rwandan Civil War.[2]In 1990, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group composed of Tutsi refugees, invaded northern Rwanda from their base in Uganda, initiating the Rwandan Civil War. Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war, and the Rwandan government led by Juvenal Habyarimana[4] signed the Arusha Accords with the RPF on 4 August 1993. Most historians agree that a genocide against the Tutsi had been planned for at least a year.[5][6] However, the assassination of Rwandan president Juvénal Habyarimana on 6 April 1994 created a power vacuum and ended peace accords. Genocidal killings began the following day when soldiers, police, and militia executed key Tutsi and moderate Hutu military and political leaders.The scale and brutality of the massacre caused shock worldwide, but no country intervened to forcefully stop the killings.[7] Most of the victims were killed in their own villages or towns, many by their neighbors and fellow villagers. Hutu gangs searched out victims hiding in churches and school buildings. The militia murdered victims with machetes and rifles.[8] An estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 Rwandans were killed, about 70% of the country's Tutsi population.[2] Sexual violence was rife, with an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 women raped during the genocide.[9] The Rwandan Patriotic Front quickly resumed the civil war once the genocide started and captured all government territory ending the genocide, forcing the government and genocidaires into Zaire.The genocide had lasting and profound effects on Rwanda and neighbouring countries. In 1996 the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched an offensive into Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), home to exiled leaders of the former Rwandan government and many Hutu refugees, starting the First Congo War. Today, Rwanda has two public holidays to mourn the genocide, and denial or historical revisionism of the genocide is a criminal offence.[10]	----->	-21

64325611	I'm surprised at how much I like this little city-builder -- and after playing it how much I wish other builders were like this. Gone are the traditional grids and endlessly waiting around for resources and population to build my next factory. It sits halfway between The Sims and SimCity, in a medieval setting. Take your time to build walls and fences, decorate gardens, and embellish your lordly manor. Also stop and look at the modding scene (available from within the game). There's some fantastic mods out there to bring your city to life. If you're still on the fence, take a look at the Community Hub and the screenshots players post. The idyllic medieval world just craves to have little stories told.It is early access, but it's very functional, and mods really bring more life to it. The publishers update it regularly, though not as often as I'd like.	----->	8
64329301	Biggest difference this game has from other city builders is the organic creation of paths & roads. Your little people also get to decide how they'll arrange their houses You only decide which areas  are zoned for housing. I hope in the future there are some town defense challenges similar to Caeser. All in all, solid game. I'm glad I got  it in early release. Also found this because Nooblets played it a bit.	----->	7

64388411	Basically a colorful, more charming, and overall better Banished. The villagers are fun to watch, trees bend in the wind, and you get to personally design your village's most significant buildings like town halls, keeps, churches, and castles. I was on the fence about the purchase given the Early Access label, but Foundation is worth its price tag. I logged 13 hours on day one. If this game gets any better, it will threaten my career. 	----->	9

64416719	The awesome duality of being spy and sniper both give a stark contrast in terms of game play. On the side of the spy, you have to be carefully observing the sniper while at the same time trying to pretend to be an A.I.. It is of course extremely difficult, but also very satisfying when successful. On the opposite side of the game, when playing sniper you have to deal with an overload of information. This teaches the player both patience and the ability to filter large amounts of information to find key details. Both sides are extremely satisfying to play. I very much recommend this game to anyone who likes challenges and enjoys trying to fool other people.	----->	10

64693704	I like the building experience.  It's like a mid-evil Sim City.  Only one hardship event to work through, that's the storm. It is a good start to a game that could be great.  It needs a campaign or storyline to keep it more interesting (some purpose). Would like to have neighboring city's competing for resources, defending territory against them with your Army, in search of the [King's/Clergies/People's] favor (the more you support one the less you can support others, and each comes with unique benefits) in order to meet some sort of mission objectives (certain population size first/certain number of tiles/certain building (maybe one that is dedicated to the [king/clergy/people] that you choose to support).

The unique building style gives you a lot of control over how your city looks and is really intuitive and easy to use.You can endlessly expand your village into a tremendous city with walls, cathedrals and a beautiful countryside. There is some skill required to managing everything efficiently to maximise your growth, however the game is still forgiving enough for anyone to enjoy.At the time of this review the game is incomplete and it can be quite obvious at times. However, you can still play the same save game for as long as you like.	----->	10

64811077	I discovered this game today when I was browsing for city building games and it quickly drew my attention.It has a pleasantly relaxing atmosphere and game style. Building my first lumberjacks and stonecutters immediately reminded me of my first hours with “The Settlers” - back in the day when that series was still great and enjoyable.I think this game truly is a rough diamond with lots of potential.Unfortunately, in its current state the game is still a little bit too rough for me… The UI is horrible, hotkeys are more or less non-existent, and the tutorial is more confusing than helpful.Why do I still recommend this game?Because the atmosphere is already excellent, and I can see myself having many hours of fun with this game – as soon as it has been polished enough.Therefore, I won’t refund the game but keep it in my library to support the developers. I really hope that they use the great potential of this rough diamond to create a great city building game and a worthy unofficial successor to “The Settlers” - something I've been awaiting for a long time.	----->	21

I hope they continue to grow and build this awesome game!	----->	8
64851064	Open ended Medieval city building.  The alpha release hooked me and the game has done nothing but continue to get better.  It is still in development, and more features are yet to come.  But if you like city builders, but don't like controlling everything (electric, water, roads, etc) then this game may be more your style.  The villager pathing system is at times amazing and annoying, and yet it's what makes this game so very different from others.; your villagers will go how they want to go.  I've been playing for over 6 months now, and haven't managed to build the same city twice.	----->	9

64991716	this is a super fun game, HOWEVER if you don't have a group of friends to play it with it is not a good purchase. there aren't many maps that come with the game, so if you wan't to extend your playtime with the game then you'll have to go into the workshop. Golf it also has a pretty intuitive map maker if you're the creative type	----->	14

65058108	As a huge fan of Banished, this early access game has been a satisfying alternative. Still some glitches, but these are being smoothed out on a regular basis. Definitely recommended if you like city builders/strategy games. You can build an army but there really isn't any combat strategy; I like this aspect because I am not a big fan of army games(it is all off screen and quite easy). Plan for bad weather and influx of populations, set zoning areas for city planning and even build your own castle!	----->	10

65155613	A great game for early access. I love the dynamics of grid-less building. Some interesting bugs still but expect those to be ironed out by the time full release comes around. (A funny one was placing a fisherman hut backwards on the coast, makes the worker walk on water to the fishing spot instead!). Looking forward to developments as they come!

65284323	i really like this game. i like the progression tho at times it can seem slow if you dont know what to do next. i have experienced some glitching. like sometimes when you select a building to build. after its builded when you hit the go to button. it takes you to the corner of the board. i wouldnt mind seeing the grounds leveled some when building on slopes or hills. the trade menu seems a bit underdeveloped in that the things we may want or need to buy is not always purchasable. so i wonder why its there to begin with. it can get messy when i need to buy fish or herbs. but when i go to trade for them. the trade is never realized and im stuck not knowing what to do about it. might be much but i also wish it was optimized more for lower end cpu's that dont have the power truly needed to run the game. just a few gripes, but i overall love this F@&ing game!!!!!	----->	9

65314226	Well I think this game is not too bad in my opinion. The graphic is very well, and the stuff in game looks nice. Though it might be very hard to catch how the game works even though they have the tutorials and guidelines for you. I think the game is pretty similar to Kingdoms&Castles and if you have played that game, then you should try this one too. It is very fun and entertaining. Dont grow too fast but also dont grow too slow.	----->	1

65658329	Buyer Discretion as an Early Access game!  I definitely recommend this game to the more patient gamer, in early access!  Buying Foundation in early access helps to support development of this incredible new work of art! However there are some things in game that could be very frustrating, thankfully these things are being worked on by the developers.                             Neg: This game is still early access so there are some glitches and major programming                                       work that still needs to be done.                             Pro: Foundation has incredible new ideas for this genre. Main example but not limited to,                                      Zoning residential arias so housing developments are built by the citizens creating                                      more natural neighbourhoods.                              Neg: Official clear instructions and complete tutorials coming soon!                              Pro: Beautiful Animation.                             Pro: Your creativity is actually important to the development of your kingdom.                              Pro: You can NOT approach this game with the same strategies and thinking as all other                                      building sim games. Very refreshing!                              Neg/Pro: Spent a lot of time playing! Positive 5 points.  Negative 3 points.     *****I am Very EXCITED for this game to be finished!*****           The animation reminds me of the classic Stop motion claymation Christmas cartoons. Christmas also has decorative light up miniature villages. Its as if Foundation is showing you what your Christmas village is doing for the rest of the year!	----->	9

65740480	You can tell its still in early access with some minor features (like priests) not being available yet. Also that you sometimes get code in the UI.Other than that though, the game plays exceptionally well. I'm honestly in love and I can't wait to see this get bigger. I loved Banished, but always felt limited in stories, and missions. I'd get bored after awhile and it does not look like those concerns with Banished will be fixed in the future. For Foundations though, I could see the possibilities being endless if implemented properly9/10 would buy again	----->	5

65807446	Foundation is definitely worth a try if you enjoy builder type games. but it does come with its annoyances. Once you reaach 100 pop you'll start to see.  For example, the whole residential zone/ desirability mechanic definitely needs to be looked at by the devs. I'll have full desirability on a res. zone and still have 1 or 2 villagers without homes. but this is nothing that cant be fixed with a patch.	----->	4

65827374	A great editor game with friends, unbalanced and unpredictable controls. I can hit the ball with what feels like the same way every time, and yet it goes different distances and speeds every time. The controls feel like they were added to try and distance the game from GWYF, but the smooth frames and great in-game editor are already enough to do this. It needs different control schemes and a visual representation of how hard and fast the ball will be hit.TLDR: Its better than GWYF on all fronts except for controls. There is a need for different control scemes or a better representation of how I'm hitting the ball. I can't tell how hard I'm going to hit it, thus costing me and my friends tons of shots every time.	----->	12
65835755	i liked everything about the game but there is one more thing that i need more maps to play on	----->	2
65840716	Tactical multiplayer sorta tower defence game. Games are usually around 2-5 min, allowing you to play for a brief time before switching to something else. Plus, since you can only communicate through emotes, there is no toxic multiplayer chat	----->	-1

65968747	(Pro tip: build wells if your villagers aren't building areas you want)This is like Banished, Cities Skylines, and Anno 1800 all combined. It's fun and satisfying.To anyone questioning whether or not they should buy because people say the game is impossible past 100 people:Buy the game. The sale isn't huge, but the game's worth it. Around 18 hours in and I've had no issues managing my colony aside when I'm really not paying attention to resources. I have nearly 400 people now.My only suggestion for the devs is that you change how the transportation and storage of goods is handled. Warehouses and granaries are annoying to micromanage using a socket based system. Make them general storage or specialized storage, but let them store any resource of that type up to a limit without having to choose only 4 resources per storage.Adding a goods transportation system like horse carriages would help out immensely. Villagers sometimes walk close to 10 minutes to find resources despite having some already nearby. Speeding up all villagers would be silly, but specializing a job to transport resources -from- warehouses -to- workplaces faster than villagers just walking makes sense.Other than that, I'm liking the game and am hoping for more added features so it can stand a bit further out from many similar games.	----->	10

66039881	This was written during the games alpha status so it might differ from upcoming updates etc.Very fun game. But later on it's basically just increasing the general size of the town. There didn't seem to be any need to build walls or something to protect the villagers as there was no thread against the kingdom. Also tried to buy more weapons as I had 3500 gold nearly all the time which was pretty sad. It would also be nice to select which villagers are in need or what exactly. Hard to tell which 50 out of 150 villagers are missing a church or something ieven tho I build the whole area to have a church and market and some sheep statues. xDBtw saw the black sheep and it is very nice. ;)Keep going. Also. I like the freedom to build a big lord mansion etc. Let's the creativity flow a lot. I find that very advanced.To make the game a bit more interesting it would be good if there were some enemy troops attacking every now and then after you send out troops to the king to support him during battles.Would at least help somewhat. ;)	----->	17
66060642	I had my eye on this game a while back as the concept was very interesting, but I wasn't really into the idea of playing this sort of game with strangers. I picked it up with a friend and had a total blast.There are a lot of complaints about the price, and I understand why because I've seen it in similar scenarios with other games, but I feel like the amount of fun I have with this totally justifies it.I have not tried matchmaking so I'm not sure how well the game does on that front, but if you have friends who enjoy this sort of game I would highly recommend it.	----->	10

66076270	The game lacks a fleshed out tutorial, instead softly guiding you from the very start. It's very refreshing and lacks the stress of many other city builders. The gridless system is amazing, but the height differences are a bit drastic at times.I'm going to enjoy continuing to grow my settlement into a city.	----->	2
66079441	It takes a bit of time to get familiar with all the mechanics. but once you know how to navigate those, the game becomes quite fun to play	----->	4
66079831	Very fine, and is a nice slow, change of pace game, with amazing details and great graphics!	----->	10
66080919	Definitely still in working stages as should be expected with an early access game, however the systems are fleshed out and entertaining while also offering highly variable layouts and overall situations. This is a good game for anyone who's a fan of management games, especially those that follow a group of settlers through the building of a kingdom.	----->	8

66096754	I appreciate this game is early access to keep that in mind when reading this...Game is generally good and well-polished. It's fun. BUT, replayability is pretty low and it gets a bit grindy after a while. Overall though, it's enjoyable.	----->	6

66116362	What a game! If you are looking for a relaxing and pleasant time consuming medieval city builder, then look no further! It takes time to develop areas and infrastructure which for me is greatly rewarding, lots to build, been playing 6+ hours and i have not even begun to build an army. If you liked Settlers etc then this is going to be your bag (although i have not encountered any combat yet). I highly recommend this game!!!	----->	5

66173846	Reminds me of Stationeers, lot of work to be done but its too fun to wait!	----->	4
66175197	Still some visual bugs and rough edges, but very playable. You may want to wait for release, but keep an eye on this one if you like builder games.	----->	3
66181901	It's a great sim game! Lots of things to think about. There was a pretty steep learning curve, but it only took maybe 10 minutes to really get the hang of it. There's a few minor bugs to iron out, but this is still an immensely enjoyable game for those who like simulator games.	----->	6
66182168	Its so fun! My friends and I played the funniest games and died of laughter!	----->	-3
66185301	This game has an amazing and well developed illustration of city building. The instructions are clear and easy to use. At times it could be difficult as everything has a learning curve but once you get into it everything starts to make sense. Also the free building for you city is pretty awesome and fun!	----->	11

66203506	Just recently came back to this game; it's still a ton of fun especially if you like colony management and logistics but it is still fairly buggy once you get past early game. Some of these bugs can be game-breaking or at least make you not want to play anymore. For example building bridges is a huge sink of time/resources and there's a pretty good chance that one you finish it, the villagers can't use it even if it's easily accessible from both sides. This has happened to me a couple times and there's no way to check if it works before you start building or edit it after you finish. That kind of thing is annoying but I'd say the game's still worth it!	----->	15

66246497	I first watched gameplay on youtube which made download this game, the customisation was very appealing. Its a beautiful game which offers some very unique features.I've only played the game for 3 hours at this point, I had to restart once because I ran out of tools (I think I built the church before the Lord Manor which then means you run into resource problems, I kept at it and you can get through it even if you run out of tools its just a very long awkward delay, its definitely quicker to restart ) There will definitely need to be a better tutorial in game once the game is finished, I've had to google a few things. Starting the village the second time around has gone a lot smoother, I'm already used to the controls and assigning villagers so its easy to get used to.It looks like there is plenty of content and every village is slightly different due to endless building rotations and extensions that can be added, I'm very excited to see what military will be like.	----->	9
66255885	A very good city builder...easy and intuitive user interface....with loads of potential....i cant wait for it to be completed.ps: the lack of steam workshop is a minor downer...but i dont feel the need for mods at the moment.	----->	1
66257221	Great game and relaxing. BUT, the downside is there are so many glitches, waiting for a more sophisticated development in the future!Also, the user interface is really hard to understand at the beginning and the trade system is really weird.	----->	-1
66276682	I can recommend this game. It both fun & frustrating at the same time. If you think that you are a good golf player then think again, this game will break your career.	----->	7
66281840	Fun Game! Great Custom Maps!	----->	0
66282592	Each update brings more and more.  This game will be a must have for city sim fans when complete.  Still a lot of fun now.	----->	4
66285649	I got this game when it was on sale, and it was definitely worthwhile. Although it's still a little rough around the edges, it looks like it will be a very enjoyable game when finished. As it's in EA, there are features that are not yet active, such as priests and the bailiff. There are other features that don't seem to work quite right, such as traders only going to one warehouse, supply system output suddenly dropping (without the weather event), difficulty with housing placement, and stone bridges not being functional.BUT, the developers are actively working on improving the game, and what is there now is still enjoyable, even with the problems. I just downloaded it a couple days a go and I love the look and feel of it. It may not be worth full price yet, but it will be. Consider it an investment towards a great game in the future. I can hardly wait for the next update.	----->	12

The music alone is very calming tot he point my pup fell asleep to it. Easy to dump many hours in this. Now there is some glitches and the help window doesn't fully explain how things work.	----->	5
66305358	The game is pretty easy to get the grasp of. Wish there was more direction as far as what to do.. Also wish citizen management was a little better than just one menu with a sorting option.	----->	5
66305534	Best golfing game next to Mario Golf Toadstool Tour. 10/10	----->	0
66308387	Really good game so far. Reminds me a lot of Banished. Make sure you have food before you start adding new people! Highly replayable.This game's graphics are a great. Nice choice in art style. Music and theme is well put together. On an i5 with a gtx 970 which handles well with a large town, so far. Load time is very low for new towns. Larger towns may take longer than usual to load from saves. This game's townsfolk are interesting. Some are nameless as your town grows (as of this review), which kind of ruins the immersion. The citizen progression is nice to see happen. There doesn't seem to be any citizen relations other than markets. Social interaction might be nice to see. Thanks for the UI scaling option! I can't wait to see what happens with this game.GG,-Hayz	----->	9
66313355	buggy, glitch and stupid. But the game has really nice music and it is relaxing to play a game that doesn't need to be taken seriously.	----->	3

66387397	I've seen several people say that it takes hours to get anywhere in this game. This is not true. If you know what you're doing you can level up fairly quickly. Now that being said, once you have most things unlocked there really isn't much to do in my opinion. Still a great game to burn some time and get creative with. Would like to see some things cleaned up like images not showing when warriors are out and various things like that.	----->	11

Very simple mechanics and very simple game play. You don't need to spend hundreds of pounds on a gaming PC to play it either! Game is overall really fun and enjoyable with minor bugs.	----->	9
66453619	I was looking for a really peaceful game that i could play casually and I really like this game. Pros are I can put it into the background for a while and also put a lot of attention to it if I want. I can add decor and think about what to improve in my village next. The only thing is I wish the tutorial was a bit fleshed out as I've played this game for hours and some things are still really confusing. I hope in the future they add more careers, and put more attention as to us being able to control the villagers. I also hope there are more options for decor as I find that really fun in city builders and games like the sims.	----->	17
66457728	I keep coming back to this game over and over again to see how development is coming along.  I am always pleasantly surprised at the progress and enjoy the newly implemented features.  I am excited to continue to do so.	----->	7

66545545	This game is very early access. With that said there are 2 main comments I have.1. This game has great potential to be great!2. In my opinion, it is not worth the current full price for the unfinished product. Get it on sale tho.Now the review. Most of my platy time has been spent idle and running while I'm typing this. I cant see more that 10-15 hours of non-repetitive play in this game as it is, but there are regular updates and an active developer.  It plays like your typical city/empire builder with resource management, production lines etc. Resembles games like Settlers, Knights and Merchants, Caesar, Zeus, Pharaoh and other single player strategy games. Like some of those games the military campaigns (quests) are off screen. The population builds their own houses in areas that you designate residential with resources from your stockpile but you can limit their development. Another feature that I like is that you get to build centers like churches Strongholds and City centers that you can upgrade. The maps are large so you can build out and up.Unlocking new buildings and production lines is done through the centers (Labor, Kingdom, Clergy) and by promoting citizens. This is achieved by providing them with all of their needs as listed on their character pages then by paying to promote them at the end of the month. A screen will pop up and prompt you.After a while the game runs out of names and starts numbering your citizens by Male#1434 for example.	----->	16

66610977	What a truly beautiful and special game this is. I have been thoroughly enjoying just chilling out in the evenings after a hard days work, tinkering about with my town and plans. During the Coronavirus this is precisely what is needed with all the bad news circulating in the world. I am excited to see where this game goes.In my game, at the moment the fishermen seem to be able to walk across water and the boat is missing. I've nicknamed them Jesus. Not sure if this is a bug that has been reported but thought I would report it. Another suggestion I felt would be great is related to following a citizen. When you click the crosshairs icon it zones down on them but it doesn't seem to highlight the person, so if you have a crowded street it is difficult to find them. The same for where they live. I realise it's early days and the UI and general mechanics will be changed over time.Excellent work Devs!	----->	7

66619642	Satisfying, fun, and beautiful. The game is forgiving, so long as you pay some basic attention to the trends of your food/clothes/luxury products. You can maintain a good sized city with pretty minimal effort.	----->	3
66627891	when i got this game a couple months ago, it was hard and almost unplayable. i just couldnt figure out what to do, i couldnt get into it. it was hard and unfocused. NOW, today, april something 2020. THIS GAME IS FUN. its intuitive. the animation is adorable. i have a big ol town goin on, going towards a nice kingdom. I LOVE THIS GAME. i will spend the rest of my freetime not shooting people in COD, playing this game. it reminds me of age of empries in style.	----->	2

66759507	TL;DR Buy on a big sale.I really enjoy this game. It is an enjoyable concept. The art is amazing! It has SO MUCH potential.HOWEVER, it has a lot of loose ends. Citizens don't get names after so many. Some dynamics (like assigning jobs but having to keep track of where everyone lives) are tedious and hard to use. Some things have started to be implemented but left open like priests and scholars. I believe that with a little bit of work this game could be one of my favourite games. I hope they keep working on the little issues and bugs that it has. I'll definitely update this to reflect it if it does.	----->	3

66843304	Really enjoying this game in its current form. A lot of changes and polishes to be made, but it has a ton of potential. Hope to see randomization in map generation and the quest/military portion of the game is pretty rough, but I enjoy the free form nature of menus as they pop up for your interaction, and the creativity available in building larger structures. Looking forward to future updates. Keep up the good work!	----->	9

66958075	Very relaxing -some things might get trickier when the game is finished, as example negative effects when you run out of money. As a heads up for new players: Your soldiers do not come with swords in hand, so if you don´t equip them first, they will happily go on war missions empty handed and will never return^^Overall a great city builder for all that don´t like optimizing their Anno builds on graph paper, but just want to see a community grow and evolve.	----->	1

66972671	Great game. Addicting, visually stunning, and packed full of content for an early access game. Still areas of improvement. I would like to see statistical tracking, such as in Banished, where you can track resource production/ use over time, which helps recognize trends. This would help a lot once the population increases to levels where management becomes more macro.	----->	6

66982423	I have always been a big fan of the Settlers series of games, so when I first saw this, that was my immediate point of reference. We are currently living in strange times and I am so glad I have come across this as it is a great way to take you away and concentrate on something else. It is the classic city building game, but it has a feudal setting and the best thing about this is how the cities grow organically.This makes such a huge difference as you can really shape your city. There is some zoning of the city and and you can zone out your farms, residential, extraction and reforestation zones.The came really does look good as well with an atmospheric soundtrack which adds to the game.This game is still a little rough around the edges and could do with a little more polish but that shouldn't detract from what is a great game.I guess the one criticism is that there isn't a lot of structure to the game, but it is sandbox in nature, so you will either like or not. But I have undoubtedly fallen in love with this and it gets the big thumbs up.	----->	21

67176043	I've read a few reviews on here with people saying its too expensive (at the time of this post it goes for  $24.99). I've paid over $60 for games I've played maybe 10 minutes max, and I've played free games where I've sunk over 300 hours. To me the value is in how much I enjoy the game. This game is great. I played it with my friend. We started a voice chat in a discord call and after each match discussed what gave a spy away or how we avoided detection. Since its early access at this point, I understand there are a few areas that need polish. One area that could be improved is the lobby system. It can be hard to read and confusing but after you get the hang of it you dont even notice it anymore. Highly recommended. Can't wait to see what other features and improvements will come in the future.	----->	-3
67180267	Really loving this game.

67223475	In short, would I recommend Foundation? Hell yes.The longer version:I came to Foundation from Banished - I love Banished (830+ hours of game time), and I have to say, this is better, MUCH better. Sure it is early access so the devs are still adding stuff, sure the workshop in Banished has more mods, but Foundation is clearly going places and doing it in style. It looks great (IMHO, and in a fun Disney animation sort of way), it is stable (100+ hrs and I've never had a freeze, fatal error or CTD), both the pathfinding and AI seem remarkably good punkt - even more remarkable because it is early EA, I also get a steady 60FPS until very late game  on a GTX 1080Ti when it drops into the mid-40s. There is a good, if not expansive, selection of buildings and production chains already available that are buildable all over the map - yes, the models can cope with being placed on very steep slopes without hanging mid-air or being buried in the ground. 360 degree rotation, adjustable heights for many pieces and 'build zones' that allow you and the plebs in your village to build anywhere and at any angle within the zone mean you really do end up with a natural looking and 'organically' shaped medieval village with winding main streets, tiny alleys between houses as well as mini plazas around wells and at road intersections.The monument buildings  - Manor Houses (2 skins), Rustic Church, Stone Church  (3 skins), Castle and Monastery (3 skins) are all modular construction sets with multiple building pieces (rooms, walls, towers, ornamental bits, doors etc) that allow you to manually adjust the height of individual pieces and can either snap together or be freely placed (with overlaps or gaps) that allow you to create genuinely unique structures.This is not an overly difficult city-builder - your towns can certainly fail at any point if development becomes unbalanced, but you won't have the sort of nightmares that were created by traffic management issues in Cities Skyline. Gameplay has some other interesting premises - for example, you as the lord are responsible for building and maintaining everything in your realm (buildings cost gold to build and maintain), the gold for that comes from selling stuff to your villagers (haha - stuff they produce and you then sell to them), villagers can be promoted (costs you gold) from newcomer to serf, commoner and then citizen, but each level of status adds to their demands (newbies need almost nothing, citizens demand luxuries). People don't starve to death in Foundation, but unmet demands reduce happiness, this reduces immigration and then people start leaving and....you know....defeat. People also don't want to live near smelly/noisy industries so not all workplaces can/should be right next door to homes, which adds to the zoning and pathing complexities of balancing quality housing with access to market places and work places. Buildings and abilities unlock with milestones (often linked to the number of villagers, their status,the prestige of your town based on what you've built and whether or not you've completed some fairly simple missions to help out your people, king and/or clergy), this forces a more natural development path - sometimes you just can't build stuff even though you can financially afford it because, for example, a cashed-up hamlet of 10 berry pickers don't need a massive concentric fortress to protect them. Such a fortress of course also needs space, and land to expand an ever growing village also costs, although at this point I have found gold to be pretty easy to come by, but not being able to lay out a wide variety of building across the whole map at the start of the game means either waiting to buy land to build or build it here now and then knock it down and build it over there later. This is turning into a book, so I'll stop now, but hopefully you get the idea. Again, in short, would I recommend Foundation? Hell yes.	----->	31

67239178	Foundation is one of the best city management games out there right now, or at least in my opinion. It's a game with many competitors, such as; Cities: Skylines, Game Dev (i guess), and Startup Company (also i guess). Great game, must buy!	----->	3

67261104	If you're a city builder fan and you like a bit of a survival aspect this game is perfect,however there are a few bugs that make the game unfavorable at times, glitched trade moments can have random sudden negative income even when you aren't buying goods from other kingdoms, Villagers can become glitched and wont work or if they do it can be buggy at times, but these small bugs shouldn't deter you from the game as i didn't really notice any of this till i was doing a second play through with several hours put in, and the glitches soon resolved themselves, but it can understandably be frustrating when it causes a loss of population due to unhappiness, however overall the graphics, game play, and endless hours you can sink into a kingdom definitely make this a good choice for any city builder fan	----->	6
67262575	After 13 hours my favorite part of this game is trying to figure out why my soldiers wont use the front door and choose to morph through the wall. This game is still in its infancy but has a lot of promise and honestly is worth the current price. I would like to see more jobs added and maybe some options for lower end housing and crime, similar to other city building games. This game has a lot of promise and I cant wait to see what they add in the future!	----->	8

67384855	After playing a few hours i can commit its a great game if you are into creating a natural looking medieval village. I missed  this typ of game since Medieval Lords. Well, i loved settlers 7 or the old anno games a lot, but Foundation let you build from a little hamlet to a prospering village and it looks like its really grown natural, in a middle of a wonderful landscape. Most thing i love is that i am able to let a forester plants single trees where i want it, to get a natural realistic look of a village, a feature that no other game offers. But, with all the fun and the beautiful look of the game,  and no game ruining bugs, its still a alpha. Lot of things are not implemented, unexplained or even not finished. At the moment its, like many others said, a playable, beautiful, but unfinished and unpolished sandbox game. I really hope they finish it this year, because what i have see was very promising and i have still so much fun with the game, and not abandon it. That would be a shame.	----->	26

67391138	This game is fun to play.  I have a little over 12 hours playing it right now and i'm still trying to find the best way to keep everyone happy and not leave my town.  As with any game it takes time to find the little things to get by on key points like this.  I do like the fact that you put where something should go but the towns people take the rest in where they put their homes and what paths are created.	----->	13

67744061	I find this game a lot of fun ! I usually don't buy early access games but since it's been in development for a while I figured it's worth a try and what a good choice that was !Disclaimer:It is obvious that the game is still in development since there are many things that have no tool tips or system to really figure mechanics out outside of trial and error and the game definitely needs  more tools to watch service access etc. There are also unfinished mechanics mid implementation.All that being said I love the game ! First of all it looks great, it's a lot of fun and there is a lot of detail to construction process and basic operation of buildings/villagers. It really sets the game apart from a few other other builders that are in development at the moment.It's challenging if you are into efficiency :D and you get to try a few times before you get things right. Since there are no grids you first have to learn the mechanics in which the NPCs act before you can start optimizing.Overall it's worth the money if you are into city-building !Here is what I would like to see improved in order of my personal priority:clear overview of what needs each villager rank has/which goods they will start buyingclear overview of services that are accessible to each house (The overall happiness shows the amount of people and shows a picture of what the need is but there should be a way to clearly see which houses are affected by lack of service/goods provided.)More ways to spend gold, maybe festivals or some way to increase productivity of certain chains by having the maintenance cost increased significantly. It's one thing to be over-capped on goods its another to not really look at gold since quite an early stage of the game. I'm just constantly over-capped, worst case scenario I wait a few days for it to refill.More requirements to building chain progression, it doesn't make sense to get a cheese maker when I am 2 promotions away from being able to utilize it. There should also be a better overview that clearly shows that for example monastery is mainly a production building, it's hard to figure out at the moment as well as how to assign workers there.Resource list by category, consumables, raw materials etc.That's my bit hopefully someone finds it helpful.	----->	23

67896837	Fun Game! Very difficult to succeed as I tried starting over numerous amount of times as I was learning the game. Here's the issues I came across:You need two things to succeed in this game gold and people. You earn gold from selling items that you make.  I tried making abundance of food and no people came to my town. I tried expanding quickly and a lot of people came then I ran out of food quickly. It's difficult to keep people in your city once they run out of food. Is it better to spread out the markets throughout your town?I've been trying to keep my stoners near the stone piles and wood cutters near the trees. I've kept my warehouses near them both to save the town folk time to go back and forth. I've been keeping my church and labor mansion around the same area? Is that mistake?I'm running out of ideas. Anyone else have another strategy?	----->	1

67978180	[h1] Fidel Dungeon Rescue-《Fidel的地牢拯救》	[/h1]被机核核推节目安利来的，香疯了！[b] 游戏通过操控一只小狗来解救他的祖母，由roguelike+解密双要素组成。	[/b] [b] 关于roguelike：	[/b] 在游戏中玩家需要操控小狗从每一层的起点楼梯到达终点楼梯前往下一层，根据每一层的关底解锁要求的不同（获得15经验值等）来解锁终点楼梯的锁。途中自然少不了各种怪物的阻挠，而击杀怪物便是获得经验值的方法。同时，经验值也可以用来升级，升级的唯一作用是提升最大HP上限，初始2点，每升级一次增加一点上限。道具方面，每个楼层都会配备医疗包以恢复到当前最大生命值，还有一些宝箱，有的给予金币；有的比较阴险，会直接扣到血量为0。获得的金币（上限9个），每3个可以释放炸弹，范围是小狗上下左右四个方向的1格；每9个可以恢复满HP。这里需要注意的是，这款游戏和其他游戏对于HP的定义有所不同，一般我们觉得血槽空了就是HP为0了，游戏结束；但《Fidel的地牢拯救》HP表现形式是一颗颗红心，红心掉完也不会立刻结束。这意味着玩家命悬一线，此时要么不要接触到怪物要么找到医疗包恢复。但即使被怪物再碰到一次，还有一次重新来过的机会，只不过入口处多了一个小鬼火。这还没完，如果你在此碰到怪物而血槽见空，也不会立刻结束，这团鬼火会化成有些可爱的小幽灵沿着玩家来时的路径追逐小狗。这时如果被追上了游戏才算真正结束。但其实游戏的战斗也并不是很正规的战斗，或者说小狗的战斗力和生命值挂钩。比如碰到蜘蛛掉1点，碰到僵尸掉完当前全部，碰到火焰蜘蛛掉2点...以上提到的怪物分布、道具掉落、地形等都是每一次游玩会完全随机的。除了每次开局的HP是2点、怪物造成的HP损失总是相同。[b]  关于解密：	[/b]《Fidel的地牢拯救》最让我感到有意思的并不是上文提到的roguelike内容，而是其本身更有意思的解密机制。小狗在拯救祖母的时候脖子上还挂着一条狗链子，并且它造就了解密中两大独特的机制。链子的优点是有“回溯”效果，玩家可以随时随地不限次数地撤销每一步的选择。（比如我刚才往下走了损失了2点HP，但应该先往上捡到医疗包恢复血量比较保险，所以就可以撤回往下走的一步，并先往上走）同样地，游戏任何步骤都可以撤销再来，以此让玩家有更多思考空间，选择最佳路径。但链子也是有缺点的。凡是走过的路，都会留下链子，狗狗不能跨越链子（相当于一笔画这类的游戏）。也就是说一层关卡的任何一个格子都只能走一次，因此玩家要在开始和过程中时刻思考下一步走去哪儿，而这一步又会对最终是否顺利过关产生决定性的影响。[b] 结：[/b] 说了这么多，也不如大家亲自买来玩一玩来的爽快，目前打折半价，18元就可以入手，闲暇时间玩一玩还是非常有意思的，烧脑又益智，解密成功的一瞬间还有那么些小小的成就感。上手了就停不下来！	----->	0

Small bugs here and there that aren't a big deal and don't detract from game play.	----->	6

May be a good idea to buy it with a friend who is also new.	----->	11

68298695	This game has great potential. I wish the game has more maps ,more buildings and more careers. A change of season will be great. The edge of the map in this game looks undone, which makes the game itself feel undone. The little people in the village are cute but they all have the same look on their faces. Creepy. Also the road system is annoying for me because you can't control where the little people go and the roads are never straight. The noise area for buildings is pretty large for such a tiny map.The guide for new players doesn't cover a lot of details of the game and players have to figure it out while playing which is frustrating. It will be great if there is a better guide or suggestions for the players. For example, the church needs monks but you can't just assign a monk yourself but it also doesn't have any explanation of how to get a monk. Confusing.	----->	10

68307050	Despite being in early access Foundation already does what I've long wanted from other city builders but have never found, a city builder that prioritizes creativity over challenge.

68579519	Not worth buying for achievement hunters. Game is fun, but there's an achievement that will blatantly disrespect your time: Doing 319 (!) daily puzzles.Even if all of those puzzles were simple, this would be a needlessly time-consuming task, but they're not always simple either. Most of the time, you'll see trivial puzzles, but then, once in a while, you'll be hit with a truly tough one. There have been many times where I opened the game for a quick daily (expecting at most 5 minutes of engagement), only to ragequit after two hours of failed attempts, unsure if that day's puzzle was solvable in the first place.If you don't care about such things, try the game, it's really good. If you have an obsessive streak and want to 100% the game without cheating, stay away. Seriously, those dailies are driving me mad. =(	----->	0

68659479	I give this a tentative thumbs up, and will update as new content is released. Overall, the game as it currently stands is a 5/10, a pretty but ultimately just time-killer'y game. A lot of the fun of this slow, methodical city builder comes from building these great custom monuments and buildings, however there are quite a few tedious aspects that inhibit the (in my opinion) fun of the game. Most of it is just standard EA-launch issues, like unclear tooltips (like how many of one material gives you another), barebones UI with unclear or too-small icons, poor balance (easier to simply buy some foods/drinks than to actually farm it), and missing features (for example, you can spawn unlimited sheep/cows at the moment, and it's completely unclear what more or less of them actually do). Beyond about 6 hours into a city, less if you know what you're doing, you'll more-or-less have everything unlocked. From that point, you can either keep building to see how large you can go, or begin building massive custom masterpieces. Other than that, the game doesn't have a lot to offer yet.Decent game for EA, but gonna need quite a bit more content and re-balancing before launch. For where it's at currently, I'd say about ~10$ worth of content, with more planned on the road map.	----->	10

68758923	After many times of trial and error I have finally figured out how to play this game... Then, there was the update and they added help screens for idiots like myself and have vastly improved this game. Foundation is beautiful and fun; everything sort of grows organically (i.e. roads and homes)  which makes it very unique. You're almost guaranteed that you'll get a different result every single time you play the game. Thank you developers for making the upgrades and making this game more polished. Absolutely recommend, relaxing game to play.	----->	7
68760390	A good building and town management game. Will be great to see it developed further with more quests, monuments, building types, and hopefully waterfront.

68816033	Beautiful game. Great music. Building construction/placement system is cool, with a few bugs. Lack of real tutorial in the beginning was pretty frustrating but eventually got by it. Figuring out why various items and buttons exist became fun, such discovering that a decorative bush actually does something besides being decorative.  Have enjoyed almost every minute. Well, except for the hours of headbanging while trying to figure out (a) why won't people build houses in this perfect area I prepped for them (People in the game are apparently just as pigheaded as people in real life. Accept it and move on until the devs fix it). There are some things you can do, but it takes some figuring out.(b) how to arm my soldiers (wow, is that what that little box next to their name is for?) and (c) food levels in late game - food just seems to disappear.  My solution was to build lots of granaries. I mean lots of granaries.  Filled them up and THEN added population while being glad the devs have yet to introduce rats, mold, and fires into the game. Balancing happiness, citizen mix, employment, buy vs build, and residential capacity can be challenging and so are enjoyable. Liked the achievements (black sheep - nice throwback) and looking for more.  Additions I'd like to see: -seasons, -population aging/children (in development, I know), -more food types (orchards, etc.), -more product chains (cattle producing beef  as well as - or instead of - milk, gem/precious metal mining for making the jewelry, etc.), - more trade possibilities beyond the current three towns including by sea, - increasingly challenging [optional] quests from envoys - for many rounds being able to send 30 berries to help the clergy was practically impossible, but after a while the appearance of an envoy became a bit monotonous but you need to keep doing it to maintain the trade bonuses.- more disaster types than just months-long rainstorms - thieves, ruffians, bandits, etc. to track down to give soldiers something more to do than go off to battle far away From my perspective well worth the price.  Looking forward to seeing new releases.	----->	12

68925313	A beautiful and peaceful city builder. This game reminds me of Caesar III with citizens upgrading when certain requirements are met and supply chain management.Love this game after the 1.9 update because it adds some flavor to each play through. You can generate money through trade routes or through taxation and your city optimization looks different depending on your goals.My favorite part of the game is how organic your towns will feel. Playing other city builders usually results in boxy cities. The free-form building and independently willed villagers give you the perfect balance of control and randomness to city development.	----->	11

68973806	This is the most relaxing game I've ever played. The atmosphere, the soundtrack and the peacefulness in just what I need in these times. If you're new to strategy games - or actually, games in general - this is a great way to get started. On the other hand, if you're an experienced strategist, this game offers, as I've said, a peaceful alternative: building a world instead of conquering it.When I saw the soundtrack was for sale separately, I lol'd, but now I kinda regret not buying it. It's a masterpiece. Even though the game is in the early stages and it shows in some things, I just can't get mad listening to it.If the devs are reading this: the tutorial could be integrated in the gameplay instead of being in text form. This is the only major thing that needs an update, imo.	----->	0

69022180	Even though it's in testing stage, it's super playable, and I like that you can choose from different landscapes. I'm a bit of a nut for anything Medieval, so being able to build keeps and all the things one needs to make a thriving medieval town is a lot of fun. I highly recommend it, if you like builder/simulation games.	----->	9
69034040	As of right now this game is very fun, I can't wait what the future holds for the game. I guess you could say Polymorph has a good Foundation....My only con would be that it's easy to get to the end game, however I'm sure that will change in the future.	----->	4

69262553	PROS: One of the nicest and most relaxing city building experience ever. The visuals and the audio is also really nice and fitting, get you in a really nice, calm mindset, where you don't feel pressure, and you can just flow with the game. The game itself is not especially hard to play, but this is a sandbox, so I guess it's not needed. There are some objectives you can do, some mission, achievements, but it's mostly about general expansion, and keeping up with the balance of ppl, workplaces, food etc. This also adds to the chill feeling, you rarely feel the pressure to build something. The monument building mechanic allows you to decorate and structure your important buildings as you wish, making them pretty unique.CONS: The game here and there have some minor bugs, and missing ingame frame limiter, thus it will eat up your resources, if you don't use any external limiters (only vsync option, but it doesn't help at all if you don't use a 60hz monitor) - although even with bigger towns, 100+ fps is not impossible with a nice hw on  max settings, so the optimization is quite nice. The UI/menu system is mediocore tops, but it doesn't get away much from the game itself. Ending thoughts: Tho it's in early access, the devs are pretty active, new content and fixes are coming continously, so it 100% worth the price if you like building-management games.	----->	14

69302145	One of the best city builders I've ever played - and it's not even in Beta, it's still Alpha. How seamless the mods can be added/removed makes it even better :)	----->	5
69308934	Overall, I would recommend the game if you don't mind waiting before it goes out of BETA.The concept is just really fun and it does not get boring easily, especially with friends! I love being both sniper and spy and the current characters that have a fully developed model look great! It's a diverse cast that's crazy enough to work. I also love the different kind of maps and the way that art style looks. A thumbs up for the art team! I've not regretted paying this price. That said, it is higher than what I am used to with early access games and I do think that throwing it on a sale, even for like 15,99 or something would help the playerbase. But perhaps that's simply not the goal for now. I am only a new player so I have no idea how quick updates come or how they will be scheduled but considering this game is in development for a long time so I can only assume the 1.0 version will be a way off. It's a very skill based game though and has ton of potential, so if you want to get an advantage before it releases and friends play it you better start now ;).	----->	15

69785727	Played plenty of games like this before, Settlers, Banished, etc.. and like this one a lot too.  Very organic way of building the town instead of via a grid layout.  Game still could use some more features which they're adding over time.  Don't expect any combat at this point, military units are just used for missions which reward resources.  Difficulty isn't too bad, and can be modded.  If you like games like this, it's worth a look.	----->	11
69790733	[Edit: 31 May 2020]Well... It looks like latest hotfix (Hotfix 1.6.1) solved most of the crashes and I haven't encountered any more crashes since it was released. Although there is a significant way to go on the project, I decided to recommend the game at this point to encourage developers and to respect their eager to solve those crashes.[Edit: 27 May 2020]I discovered game only crashes when my military troops are out on a military mission. So I stopped sending military troops to missions and haven't seen any more crash yet. I will check latest releases/hotfixes and update this review.[Orig: 25 May 2020]The game crashes every time I reach above 125 population. It is frustrating. Nothing helps once it started crashing. Even the latest development preview (v1.6) has the same problem. I am tired of starting a new game and just asked for a refund.	----->	9

69839756	I was recently contacted by a developer personally offering their help in fixing my frequent crash problem. while it turns out it was a hotfix problem, not my computer as originally thought, it still was refreshing that a developer reached out personally to a consumer because they weren't happy with the product in it's current state. As a result I am happy to change my review to positive. I would whole heartedly recommend this game. And a personal thank you to the DEV that contacted me, you know who you are. :)	----->	11

69896715	I got this game as a gift from a buddy who wanted to play it. It was only 10 bucks at the time. So far I've has an absolute blast playing this game with him. There is a very fine line between too easy and too hard for both the spy and sniper in this game but I think the dev does a good job with the balancing. My ONLY request for a future update is multi-multiplayer. Maybe 6 people attend the party with one of them being the assassin. Assassin has to identify another player and take them out without being noticed and the other players have to identify the assassin and report him.Either way this game is so fun I want to be able to play with more of my friends at once!	----->	12

69936598	I am really enjoying this game! I am a fan of both settlement/city-building games and even though this game is still in the Alpha stage, it definitely isn't a put off. The game play is so well thought out, that as you delve deeper into the game you will be met with great challenges, like micro-managing all your production lines. I love that aspect! The graphics and animations are still in need of fine-tuning, but they are still beautifully crafted. I look forward to more updates on this game and for the next stages of production.

69963175	A very good early access title. Of course, there is still plenty of room for improvement, but there's unquestionably a fun basis for a game, and in fact plays quite well already. IF... and this is important, IF this is the sort of game you want to play.So, while this is a city builder, it is a low pressure game. The game doesn't provide much in the way of objectives (there's a handful of quests early on), and there are little threats to your development. The game is a sandbox, and to enjoy it you need to be looking at building for the joy of it. I like tinkering with the systems, not because I have to, but because it is interesting to me to see what happens.So, if you need objectives, and threats, then this might not be the game for you. If you like playing in a sandbox, and can appreciate a game for being what it is, there's a lot to like (again, keeping in mind this game is incomplete). Finally, it is quite clear that the devs are working on the game and enjoy working on it.	----->	23

70045610	Been playing since early development and I LOVE this game. Love the attention to detail, the cute graphics, the production lines etc. Still in the works but I have gotten SO much play out of this bugs n all. =) So fun. It's a challenge to try and make a 'pretty' town especially at the beginning. After you establish yourself a bit then you don't feel like demolishing things to make it.. organized haha. I'm going to try again tho! (and again and again).	----->	3

70190284	The game is simple and straight forward, not particularly challenging but still fun to play. It's still got some bugs here and there but well worth the purchase price and has lots of replayability. Anyone familiar with city sims and basic production chains will enjoy it. It's essentially an upgraded version of Banished, although it adds more replayability than Banished with things like Quests. If you enjoy open-ended civilization-building sims this is a fun game and I'd recommend it.	----->	19

70216397	Great game so far.  For anyone looking to buy: this game is NOT COMBAT oriented.  If you enjoy games like Banished or even the Citys series then you'll enjoy this game.  Bit of a learning curve but once you figure a few key things out its pretty smooth and straight forward.  Graphics are really pretty for the current build and some of your buildings to upgrade as the game goes on.  TONS of freedom in building, not just where, but what- if you can picture it, you can pretty much build it.Only cons I can come up with is that the first game I ran seemed to glitch out and my people wouldn't do any work (later learned that it was in layout of my town, plan ahead and pay attention).  Not much of a con - absolulty worth the money.	----->	13

70331334	Very fun and addicting game. Being early access there are still limitations and a somewhat clunky interface, but even with that, the game is a blast. If you are a fan of games like Banished, this one will be right up your alley. Majority of what I thought were bugs, was simply a lack of understanding of how the different systems work together. The game appears extremely simple at first look, but has some fairly complex systems in place. Experimentation and lots of play will make you a master of this game.The game is worth the purchase in its current state even if nothing further is added. As the devs add even more, this game will just keep improving.	----->	9
70336334	Beautiful game. Music is lovely. Time flew. Super immersive. This is my first city-building game (after only playing turn-based strategy for years) and I am blown away by the experience. The game gets more challenging as your settlement grows and there are more elements to manage. Well done, guys! Shoutout to Quebec City from a new fan in Toronto. Merci beaucoup!	----->	3
70343504	Very fun and chill.	----->	4
70346063	Spyparty can be played both casually and competitively. I agree, the cost of £20 is steep for a game that many people will only play a few times, but you have to be willing to play it enough to really understand what this game is about to make it feel worth £20.It becomes worth the money (and worth every penny) once you move onto to intermediate play. Here it becomes less of a party game and more of a competitive 1v1 game. As spy you have to be deceptive, blend in and creative in order to complete missions against more competent snipers. As sniper, it's very much a test of memory, as well as distinguishing human behaviour from AI behaviour. There is so much to learn about how humans behave vs how AI behave, and it is a very psychological game once you get to know the playstyle of your opponent.The community is extremely kind, and also quite small at the time of writing this. Experienced players are always open to teaching new players the basics, and the community is general is the least toxic I've ever been a part of.To summarise, this game appeals heavily to intellectuals, those interested in human behaviour, and those who like memory puzzles. If you and a friend are thinking about buying this as a party game to play only a few times -  you probably think £20/$25 is too expensive, and you're probably right - although saying this, I originally bought this game to play with a friend, and then I started learning how the game works more and more and eventually found myself playing competitively.	----->	16

70365515	This is a wonderful game. The maps that the community builds are absolutely a delight to play. There is so much creativity that goes into this game. Downsides there really aren't many. There are some bugs, but that's genuinely to be expected, and  they even tell you about it on the loading screen. I would say it would be nice to trade in the hats/collectibles for a little more coins or get them a little more frequently, but hey, that's just the collector in me. I love that we can even get little things like that, it adds to the experience.	----->	15

70403940	Foundation is a game in which I find to be very fun and immersive.

70459543	It is off to a good start to be a fun little build your village somewhere in the kingdom. Buy it to support this style of light hearted game. Fingers crossed the dev will listen to the community and not only ramp up the content as time goes on (buildings/building parts/maps), but also the purpose. It will never be combat or survival supposedly, so look elsewhere for that.	----->	8
70459951	This game is great, probably one of my all time favorite city builders out there, and probably one of the few I've seen not on a grid like other city builders. This allows more creative freedom of your town. While this may not have the spawraling city builder experience, the small town nature allows you to have a more personal feel to your town and citizens. My biggest complaint is that this game doesn't look amazing in certain spots. For example the river on the mountain map glitches out and looks unfinished, and you can look on into the abyss of the maps. This is acceptable though to some degree sense it is still in alpha.	----->	13

70498875	By far the best golf game not only on Steam, but also ever made. Should provide one with theoretically endless of hours of fun, owing to the easy-to-learn, hard-to-master gameplay and the overwhelming abundance of custom community content.+ Great gameplay. Lineups, angles, trickshots controlling the power at which you hit the ball all matter in this game, and high-skill golfing is rewarded+ Comes with an in-built editor, allowing users to create their own custom maps through the client without any need for external tools or packages+ Hosting servers is easy and free, and can be set up from start to finish via the in-game client. No need to forward ports or pay for dedicated hosting+ Cosmetics unlocked through gameplay, steam achievements and trading cards- Cannon and water physics need some work- Only five default maps come with the official package (although this isn't really an issue as there are, at the time of writing, 7,684 playable maps on the community workshop)- Turning ball collision on is a fast way to break friendships and burst a blood vesselOverall I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun, largely relaxing gameplay experience at an extremely reasonable price. 9/10.	----->	6

70599506	Very fun to play. Takes a little learning to really appreciate the game but if you put in a little effort you will get many hours of enjoyment out of it.

70729917	This game reminds me a lot of Cultures - if anyone remembers that good old classic, so this is a really high compliment - but it does function a lot differently, which is a very good thing. For starters, you don't have to worry about getting a scout and putting down signposts so your people know where to go; they go automatically and the entire map is revealed from the start. (Thank the Divine for that).Secondly, you don't have villagers making other villagers - you have to create your village to be good enough for people to want to join in, and it's a really smart indicator on how good your village already. A very creative way to grow, and I like it a lot.Thirdly, the graphics are a wonderful cartoon-like style (which again reminds me of cultures) but is definitely more pleasing to the eye (and if you're someone who has to have 'better graphics' then this is should be a plus for you).OH! The sheep. Thank to whomever is obsessed with the adorableness of sheep as I am, because SHEEPS APLENTY! Bonus, if you get it during alpha, you get to build sheep statues EVERYWHERE! It's beautiful, and the caption for the statue is just perfection. The sheep don't have animation to move, they glide around (which to me is honestly hilarious), but the best part? When you purchase sheep they are small, lamb like, and when you have the speed all the way up you can watch them grow large with their fluff in real time, and it's perhaps one of the greatest things in gaming because SHEEP!Ahem. Moving on.The building aspect in this game is something that I've been craving for the longest time. FINALLY! A game that lets me build my buildings how I see fit. Yes, they give you presets and yes you have to unlock parts, but honestly? I will take it, because sometimes you just want to change some things, or move some parts around only to know you cannot, and it's just created that way. This game - the whole idea around it - allows you to build it from 'scratch', as much as it can be, and it really fills that void that gaming has lacked for a long time.Are their building games out there? Yes, but sometimes you just want a little added something to village games, that they don't provide. Like Settlers 6 for instance, you're building your own great village yeah? But you cannot design the buildings as you want. This game you can. Make sense? (Gods I hope so lol).Another funny thing is that sometimes your fisherpeople won't have boats, (don't ask why, they just don't, maybe boats are offensive to them who knows?) so they will walk/glide upon the water like Jesus and show everyone how it's REALLY done. Which imo is glorious, and I hope that never gets changed, because who doesn't want a village filled with deities that can walk upon water?The only thing that does bother me - but it will get fixed, however idk if it was reported as an issue? (too lazy to check atm) - is that sometimes when you click on certain notifications to see which exact building is built; such as the markets etc., it will send you to a far off corner of the map and you will have to find your way back to where you were. A wee bit annoying, but the maps aren't big enough to really be a nuisance, and there is a pause button (which btw I don't think Cultures had that, so HA! Take that!).All in all - without spoiling too much - this game is pretty well polished for what's given, and it's a lot of fun and very relaxing to play. If you want to build things, but not REALLY from scratch - just enough to scratch that itch - then this game is for you. You get to choose how the buildings look, and start your own village. The instructions are all clear, and googling anything that you cannot figure out is all easy to find, because this community is open and very helpful and the devs are active on the forums as well. So have fun! :D	----->	54

70970880	A very well thought-out, free place, city builder game - production chains make sense and graphics are both well rendered and still a little kitsch. Love the fact you can place what you like, where you like regardless of terrain - the buildings just adapt to hills, etc. Devs are very active and the game is constantly improving, adding in new features, patching and getting better. Other than a few glitches here and there and some missing names on your villagers (Hello, Unnamed #1076 Soldier!) you wouldnt know you were playing something very much in Beta. Worth every penny - Foundation is everything Banished promised to be mixed with everything good from Settlers and Age of Empire. Once finished, I predict a cult classic in the making.	----->	6

71000060	Really fun game when you know what you're doing but be prepared to want to bash your skull into your desk if you don't, like me. Still, it's got lots of different game modes to play, and an even bigger community that gives out work and maps galore.You can design maps yourself, but it does take a lot of time and effort (trust me, I've tried to make a map).Either way, overall its an awesome game that most of the time gets me angry and makes me feel like at the end of the day I've accomplished nothing. It has my love.	----->	13

71199950	While still clearly in development it shaping up to be a great citybuilder, loved it but it gets pretty hard to keep the production lines organized in the lategame with larger towns, having that information clearer and easy to access would be big for the game, havent really touched the military part of the game yet, manpower is way too tight still for that and that is in part because of my previous point, if the information needed was more accesible it would be easier to optimize said lines and thus potentially have some spare manpower, lots of things hinting to future features still in development, cant wait till a full release!.	----->	9
71217910	this is a causal and fun game!	----->	4
71219955	Its a great game if you have a friend to play with. No one on the invite to game list ever joins. its like no one wants to actually play the game.	----->	5

71252956	At first I was hesitant with the game but I gave it another try. I'm finding myself getting more and more excited once buildings open up and I can do more with the people and the area. I would recommend it for a nice relaxing city builder.	----->	6
71261855	It takes a restart or two to get the hang of it, but after you get a real feel for how the mechanics of the game work, it gets very addicting, very quick. Definitely needs further polishing but fun to play as is already.	----->	4

71285503	I finished the achievements today. It's a fun little game of puzzles, took a while to beat the game, but totally worth it for a small indie game.Check the screenshots for dailies, someone might be posting them if you can't figure them out.	----->	6
71288458	Amazing, more maps would be even more fun, or option to design own rooms.	----->	0
71295357	I cannot say enough good things about Foundation. But I'll try: 1) The dev team is incredible. They're active on Reddit and Steam and are extremely helpful. The updates have been very regular and each update build is better than the last. 2) The game is incredible. If you like simulation/city management games, I think this is best in class. There's just something about it that works perfectly for me. It's medieval, which is my favorite part. The organic pathfinding for roads is a really fun mechanic. I spend a lot of time trying to trick the AI into making straight lines and grids, but also love the city-mosaic feel of having unique lines and finding what buildings fit best in the organic paths. The city and resource aspect is challenging and fun early, mid, and late game. I usually work through the early and mid-game to nurse my resources to good health, and by late game I'm mostly on auto-pilot and working to build the larger monuments. 3) It's in Early Access, but the devs are very regular with updates, usually once a month. I've never been more impressed with a game in EA. It feels better and better with each update, and I can tell the game is going to be amazing when fully done. Ok now for some Cons, just to be fair. 1) May not be for you if you need a tutorial. The tutorials are very brief and not in-depth. It was a little stressful in the beginning when I realized I'd have to just play and play and hit Reddit to figure everything out. But I did! It was totally learnable without the tutorial and actually very fun. 2) Organic pathing feels weird coming from grid style games. Sometimes it can be hard to get your buildings to line up straight. Still fun though and I've grown to love it. So in short, I absolutely love this game. I think it's great for anyone who loves medieval setting and city builders/city management games. I've recommended it to everyone I know who likes those things. The Cons list is very short for me. Thanks for a great game Devs!	----->	63

71356854	I, too, have misgivings about this game's price, as do many others, and I don't really feel like I need to go into detail. But it's counteracted by the fact that, in my opinion, this game is a modern multiplayer *masterpiece*.	----->	2

It is in Early Access so I hope the creator is able to finish it before it becomes necessary to change the format of the play style to suit a new audience.  I feel an extraordinary amount of potential for this game.  Hoping for dynamic weathers and more sound tracks.  Lovely music.  Just wish there was a variety lol.	----->	6

71444064	Golf It! is everything you need in a golf game. The multiplayer is hysterical with jumping and collisions on. There is a hugely talented community of map makers who keep the game fun and fresh. The map editor system is also pretty self explanatory. I have nothing but good things to say about Golf It!.	----->	3
71482175	I have only been playing foundation for a few hours, but I know it's going to be a game I enjoy playing, as it's early access I get that there are a few issues still that need to be sorted, like codes being visible 😂 but that does not bother me, I love the building aspect of the game, and am enjoying building churches and castles ❤️ I would love a sandbox option with everything unlocked, and also paths, I like how the paths are made but I really would like an option to make people walk along a path I have already painted down and then they can fill it in.. it just makes it look messy with all the paths all over the place and not leading to the proper area, sometimes not to the door to the side. Graphics are gorgeous, I'm playing on a low end machine and I still think they are lovely, the people look like they have seen things that had rather not.. also they don't blink which is horrifying 😂 I love their little tapping walking animation though. So really my review entails it's a good, fun game, it's probably going to get better with updates, it's not worth the £30 price tag for the way the game is now, but it will be in the future if updates keep coming out. If you like games like bannished it's very similar but with more creativity. I look forward to the updates.	----->	31

71528130	For us who likes Settlers and managing work force, gathering resources and so on might take a look to this title. I think the game need some injections here and there by making the sims a bit more individual. Some extra sound effects from the working laborers would make the game more humorous and living. This game can be improved a bit.	----->	6

Tried changing resolutions, and disabling everything, and nothing, still 24 fps. I was really looking forward to this game, but its unplayable in slideshow mode.

Not played much so far, but haven't noticed any bugs, side from few placeholder text. If I have naything bad to say about it, it's that late game is micromanagement hell, hopefully the devs will adress it in later updates and introduce tools to macormanage my village.	----->	3

71830421	A very very active developer. I am pleased with the full price purchase. Yeah another score from me with early access!!!! The Foundation: You assign jobs/careers to your adorable colonist and then watch them go to work. You have different colored zones that you paint on the map similar to city skylines. Overall: This game feels like a finished game. Great looking game with no campaign just free build. A worthy addition to my city builder collection.	----->	11

71845357	An easy to start complex in detail city builder.  The system for constructing Civil Buildings, such as Keeps, Churches, Governing Houses, is diverse enough that each one is a unique building that is likely to never be copied again, while most industries are just plop in place buildings.  Auto-pathing residents find their own way from place to place.It is a fun and easy early game, with a much more challenging Mid game, and an endgame that will require all of the skills that you have gathered from the earlier gameplay.	----->	6
71845721	Get it in early access, better than its predecessors by enough of a margin now to justify the cost - not like the devs get it all.Watch the preview release, screwed the temperature way up on my laptop before the frame rate drops to a locked screen once the pop. and events livened up too much.All the mods are great, and promise to get better.Its a puzzle worth solving, even with a couple pieces still missing.	----->	5

71853134	Instantly addicted. Only downside is that you have to go back and click on a part you wanna build even if you wanna build multiple instances of the same thing.

71880178	For decades, I've been a fan of city builders. In the past few years, I've played all recent version of SimCity, City Skylines, Factorio, Prison Architect, Tropico, and Ostriv. Foundation obviously falls more in line with indie games like Ostriv and Prison Architect. To my mind, though, Foundation offers the best of what I'm looking for in a sandbox game: interesting supply chains and balancing resources for different types of citizens. The game is early access so it's not perfect; for example, once I reached 500 citizens, growing further became dull because it's just repeating the same tactics as before. My hope is that developers add more supply chains, more trade, and additional details on citizens. For the last, there is not enough citizen data to figure out where there are housing problems. This usually does not present problems and hasn't detracted from the game. All said, if you're looking for a good city builder, this is a great option.	----->	16
71889452	A friend of mine is pissing me off because every time we try to hit him he ping spikes and our shots do nothing against him. Otherwise, game is good. Just make sure you have a stable connection for the sake of everyone's sanity.	----->	-1

71893193	[h1]Introduction[/h1]This is my review for [b]Golf It![/b]. It is a very fun game to play with friends - If you have any. One could argue about the 20th Century graphics or the control system for the golf ball. However, the game really shines in its variety. It supports Steam Workshops (Assets, Maps, Sounds)! It has got an editor where you are able to build maps WITH your friends together and upload it as a Steam Workshop.[h1]In Depth Review[/h1][b]Graphics (3/10)[/b]Sorry for the harsh criticism, but this Unreal Engine. It should be a ton better by default. Textures seem done very rapidly without any attention to detail. It feels like you are playing centuries ago.[b]Performance[/b] (6/10)It needs quite a lot of performance, even in potato settings. The difference between “elite” and “low” graphics settings does not make a huge difference.[b]Sound[/b] (5/10)No variation, always the same music/sounds. The ability to add custom music although is very good.  [b]Gameplay[/b] (7/10)I quite like the unique control system of the game. But e.g. with my laptop mouse, that is some years old, it is hard to reach the desired strength. When high speeds are required, my mouse literally just dies down and I am not able to hit these big jumps. [b]Multiplayer[/b] (7/10)The multiplayer is straight forward and it has got everything you need. You can host servers with ease. No need for port-forwarding or this kind of magic. A friend can be invited through Steam which is a huge plus. On the other side, sometimes collisions between players stay unrecognized. Sometimes even the leaderboard bugs until the end and you have no chance of seeing how you do.  [b]Game Abandoned[/b] (YES?)This game is in Early Access since 2017, which is quite some time. It does not seem that there are frequent updates that address the many issues this game has, which is really sad. This game has huge potential to be [b]the[/b] party game.[h1]Conclusion[/h1]I have to admit, I would have not upvoted the game if there were no editor or Steam Workshops. There are simply too many unfinished things and bugs, which make the game sometimes even unplayable. At the end of the day, this game is a fun-haver with friends where you can live your creativity to the fullest. 	----->	19

71910126	This game in a way is very reminiscent of an old game my dad and I used to play as a kid called Pebble Beach Mini Golf.  My dad came for a visit and when I showed him this he was hooked.  He's actually going to DL Steam and buy this as soon as he gets home so we can play together.  The controls are a little funny at first but you get used to them after a while.  I haven't tried out the build your own course yet but I'm excited to try it!  10/10 would buy this game again and again.  At $4.99 its a steal, at $10 you still can't go wrong!	----->	7
71910944	All real life crazy golf venues are shut right now.This will have to do.	----->	-2
71912973	Having fun with it.  Need to micro manage, similar to banished.  Not everything is explained, so google became my friend.  I have a semi thriving village, keep yo-yoing between earning and losing money.  Since it is still in early release, I am looking forward to expected updates.   Once you get the mechanics down it is just balancing what you need to keep people happy.	----->	1
71914315	This game has a lot of potential. I have enjoyed playing it. I am mindful that it is still in early release so a lot of the minor issues I have come across relate to it not being polished. The UI is probably the aspect most in need of updating but the developers are aware of this and working on it. I really loved discovering blueprints and getting new buildings so it would be great if this was expanded on in the future to add unique buildings such as production eg apple orchards. I like the natural way citizens build homes and paths BUT I would like to be able to build roads. They can venture off etc but having a main road would add to the aesthetic appeal to the towns.The snap function with building is great, although, I do struggle to understand certain bits such as the bridge in the tavern. Still haven't found a place it connects to. In the future it would be cool to have different cultures (Asia, Middle East), but this is just a wishlist item. Overall I don't regret buying this game and look forward to what the developers do once it leaves early access.	----->	9
71916447	If you like citybuilders, this game if for you. It's currently early access, but the devs are very responsive on discord and the updates come fast enough to keep it fresh. No major complaints so far	----->	2
71918977	The best map editor I've personally ever seen in any game. Easy to use and fairly extensive guides in game. Gameplay feels really good too. Needs work but a great start for an early access game.	----->	9

71974996	I am generally against purchasing early access games because they always end up unfinished and abandoned by the Dev team (DayZ), but for some reason I didn't do that with this game and honestly it was such a good decision. This is one of the most refreshing and relaxing city builder games I have played in a long time, somewhere between Banished and City Skylines but without all the added stress. I would 100% recommend this game as it has a quickly growing community and an amazing Dev team who are very active on social media and provide constant updates. If you're still unsure I'd check out some playthroughs by YouTubers like Raptor to get a feel for it!	----->	10
71980653	The game is still limited in what you can do but I enjoy that you can truly relax with this game. You never go into the red and you don't need to micro manage trivial things like upgrading homes, which is difficult to scale as you grow... Anno was stressful for me unless you fully mastered certain aspects of the game. This you can mess around and not be penalized for it. My only gripe is HOW the citizens choose to build their homes and roads. It can get a bit crowded and odd looking but overall I recommend this game for pure enjoyment.	----->	1

71999688	A very amazing game that you can go for countless hours on. The best parts fundamentally there, just need to be improved on. Just wishing it does have a competitive mode with a larger map with other villages online or offline. And the buying of land plots I personally think it should be smaller because of money surplus sometimes is a bit much.. anyway 5 out of 5 either way.	----->	12

72026693	Honestly the most fun I've had in a long time playing a steam sale purchase with friends. Lots of laugh, and you'll gracefully alternate between sh*t talking and complimenting each others' shots. Turn on collision and this game has the potential to ruin more friendships than Monopoly. LOTS of player-made courses to download from the Workshop.Big thumb up.	----->	0

72030235	So so much fun with friends. The default maps are lacking in my opinion. Still, you can add more maps into the game from the workshop so it's not a deal breaker, it's still so much fun!

72128877	I've been enjoying it a lot so far.As my village grows, it becomes (a fun) balancing act of making sure all my worker needs are met as I try to build the latest and greatest features.There definitely was a need to consult the wiki in regards to figuring out some basic game mechanics. Once I read the wiki (and stopped ignoring some instructions the game provides when placing buildings) I was able to get a lot more out of the game.I will be excited for future releases and look forward to walls serving a purpose. It will also be nice to see every single worker get their own name. Some more worker profile pics would be fun too. I like the art the game uses already. More please! :).Thanks for constructing a great game so far!	----->	19

72142753	Ohhh man is this game satisfying! I just bought this on the weekend and ended up playing over 30 hours! I dont even feel burnt out, with a relatively simple but enjoyable loop that just keeps expanding and growing while you build your kingdom how you want it! Loving the replay value of wanting to start a fresh map with all the things ive learnt from my previous games and make it bigger and better! A+++	----->	3
72143787	You'll get a few good hours out of it before you get to a point you realize the income is impossible to keep up with the taxes and charges, but that 1 massive imbalance in mind - the game is good.  It's a lot of fun and a good casual game.Update 7 12 2020:*HIGHLY* recommend this game for anyone that even remotely likes city manager or sim city style games.  This is by far one of the most brilliant games I've seen.  You can paint where you want things to be and it creates an amazingly dynamic city every time even if you do the layout the same every single time.Mod support.  Mod.  Support.  And the modding community for this game is ABSOLUTELY amazing.	----->	19

There are some missing tutorial and help subjects. I've had to look a lot of things online. There are also some obvious early access elements like placeholders etc. Otherwise the game is a definite must play for civ building fans.	----->	4

72218629	Concept amazing. Haven't found something quite like it.Keep in mind that it is still in early access.Systems work well enough but getting to learn them is all through trial and error. You learn more on the fly than the tutorial is able to provide. It tells you how to do things but there is no indication of repercussions or what a lot of the things even mean. All of a sudden your economy is booming and then you go into a depression in one day. Of course it's your own fault but there is no way of monitoring that. It turns into a bit of a knife fight every now and then until you learn to control rapid development and expenses - at which point you can really enjoy the non-grid based, creative side of building in this game.The game has an immense amount of character and even though your world space is not randomly generated, you are free to recreate and optimize your settlement in hundreds of new ways. The terrain being constant is not a set back but an opportunity. Constant updates provide reworked systems and added content frequently. If you don't mind a bit of homework and slogging the first 20 hours then this is a really awesome city builder for you.One tip: Expand as you need by stopping immigrants. They overload the economy too easily XD	----->	6

72299212	Hilarious with friends, good price and awesome graphics. Music fits and the vibe reminds me of playing mario party mini games - smooth mechanics that are easy to learn and fun to perfect. The course level designs are beautiful to look at as well as fun to play on because some of them are quite puzzle-y and take a combo of brain & skill to not stroke out.With all this said, for the $4.50 I paid on the 2020 steam summer sale, this game is a blast to play especially with friends in voice chat. Also, I'm wicked impressed with the steam workshop community content. There are maps like the Mines of Moria and other custom content totally free that really pump up the value of this gem of a game. I'm very looking forward to 1.0 patch. Keep up the good work!	----->	26

There are some bugs for sure but saving and loading can fix nearly all of them. The game is worth getting for sure, it's a breath of fresh air compared to other city builders. Your citizens take care of building homes and roads, you are in charge of providing for their needs and making sure that your village continues to grow and upgrade.	----->	5

72510706	fun game to play with friends	----->	4
72513525	A very relaxing game that actually has a lot going for it already. It's not perfect by any means, but there's a surprising amount of content already to keep you busy for hours. I think it's really neat that the village grows organically and this has given me ideas on what I would like to do and build around it. It gives you as a player quite a bit of creative freedom, especially with the monument buildings such as the churches, forts, lords manor and etc. There are some issues of course, the main of which that its sometimes difficult to get villagers to build homes. The main way I have found to counter this so far is to build things around the housing areas to raise the desirability such as the wells, churches, markets and stuff like that. It doesn't work 100% of the time, but it helps. I can see this becoming a really good game, and it already really is but there's work to be done. Still recommend picking this up if you love city builders.	----->	16

72532657	Foundation has been a delight so far.  I have been craving a game that has the sort of organic life that this one has.  There is no grid system (except for buying new town land), and no paths other than the ones your villagers create.  Put a lumber camp right on the other side of a grain field?  Congrats, you now just created a path through amber waves of grain.  The graphics are simple, yet pretty.  While the game is still pretty early in development, I would like to see upgraded villager faces and models.  The wavy grass and fields I mentioned earlier can be intoxicating to watch.The monument system (manors,. churches, keeps, tavens, and monasteries) allow you to create awesome unique works of art while also being useful.By far the thing I love most is how things just kind of grow naturally.  All you do is paint where you want your villagers to put up their houses and they choose how it fits into your public buildings.  Really reminds me of the way the villages are laid out in Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and for whatever reason it makes me really happy,The music is also very good.  Noticeable, but not annoying.	----->	15
72538907	Love this little city builder.  It adds a unique feature to design and easily build custom large buildings like castles and churches.  With the easy drag and drop components, it offers infinite replayability.	----->	1
72539190	The game is great and more people should play it, but like many others have said it is way too expensive for what you are getting. It's actually been the only barrier for me to by multiple copies for my friends and family. I've been waiting for some kind of sale or something because $25 is nuts.	----->	5

72630462	I have watched a few gameplays online of this game, and it's amazing! Super fun game, and I would have bought it + encouraged my friends to buy it as well, BUT its waaay too expensive for what it is right now, especially in beta.	----->	6

72656585	Hello, I like to start off by saying this game is super fun and hella addicting, BUT i have some suggestions that would possibly make it better. 1. I believe making the townies have more diverse character styles would improve the immersion of the game. 2. Is it possible to add marriages, the church feels empty and i think having occasional weddings would be awesome..3. Life cycles. I personally don't like that the only way to get more people is by them immigrating to you. It would be cool to see your townies actually living. Getting married, having babies, and eventually dying.4. Speaking of death, there should be way more deadly ways to die. Scenarios like poison berry bushes, natural disasters, and plagues. 5, If you do decide to add kids, could you add a school building and fun medieval kid decor.6. Roads. it is really hard to make them create paths the way i wanted them to make them, can there be a easier way to set up paths. 7. Water textures is very low quality i would like to see a little bit more detail, maybe some waves on the beaches. This game overall was really fun and you aren't even done developing it. I cant wait to see what you decide to do in the future. I hope you add some of my ideas, if not that's ok, i will still think Foundation is an amazing game.	----->	29

72742544	Game is hella fun right now but I would recommend waiting for the UI overhaul before purchasing, some menus are extremely obtuse and some tabs are improperly named to the point where it's confusing as a beginner. You don't need a tutorial but it could help as well. UI update should be out soon so wishlist and then buy after. I'm personally putting it on the shelf until then.	----->	6
72754195	Very pretty and organic!  Every village develops differently.	----->	1
72755016	This is a really good game to play with friends. After completing the base game, many online maps in the steam workshop will keep the game fresh for hours on end. There's a sweet option that let you hit each other and sabotage while playing; so if you want to make some enemies, this is your game too.	----->	5
72756680	Its still in alpha but this  game has great potential. I love how the villagers grow by themselves and construct their paths and house how they can.

72827095	New favorite city builder! Such freedom in placing, edit and decorate your builds. Keeping the managing side of city builders there aswell as some trading. I havent yet get to the point were you can make your minions swing pickaxes against rocks to start your own little poluting smithing area but i can't wait!	----->	4
72832758	This game has been in Beta for many years now but the concept is absolutely AWESOME. A spy has to blend in a crowd of NPC and accomplish missions which will give subtle (or not) hints to a sniper who's overlooking the party to find and kill the spy. Be ready to sweat profusely as you'll have to focus 100% of your capacities on everything as a sniper and take some calculated risks as a spy. The skill ceiling cap is HUGE and you'll learn new tricks every day ! The player base isn't large however I've never failed to find a lobby as soon as a log in.The price should go down a little though, 15€, in my opinion, would be more attractive.P.S : You might need to write down some lines in a file inside the game folder if you are playing with an AZERTY keyboard as the settings won't allow you to bind keys. Check the internet or ask me if you struggle on this point.	----->	-8

72907381	This game is wonderful. A ton of fun, a unique experience, and a great 1v1 option for friends. Its tough to find great 1v1 games, and I think this is one of them.BUT. Why in the world is this $25. The critically acclaimed game Hollow Knight is $15. And I would hazard to guess that it offers well over 100 times the content. I know that different developers have different situations, but this is an online, short form multiplayer experience. Most people aren't going to get even 20 hours of gameplay out of a game like this. At most I like to boot it up and play it with a friend for 30-40 minutes every couple months. And I'm not saying there isn't a place in my library for games like that. I actually like having some quick games to play on the odd night that there is only one or two people in my discord server. But $25 is way too much. Show me $10 and I can start recommending this to friends. I honestly think this game has the potential to pop off in sales with a lower price point.	----->	10

72942000	Enjoyable game, it gets polished at every patch while more and more content still gets added regularly. It reminds me of Banished for a lot of aspects, less atmosphere and realism, but much more content. In my opinion this games lacks some features and balancing at the endgame. There is not much to accomplish when all the buildings are unlocked, and at the same time the custom buildings that the player had to build in order to unlock them will eventually flood the map.The army mechanic gets improved at every patch, it would be fun to be able to play the battles instead of having them resolve automatically in the background with some dice rolls.Overall its already a solid game, fully playable and unlocking everything will take dozens of hours.	----->	11

72947418	Interesting maps, great game play (definitly a game you want to be talking to the other players on, so teamspeak or discord with some friend's is a must). I do recommend it, it is frustrating, but not too frustrating!Only one complaint I have is that they should optomise this game ASAP. My Nvidia 1080 on a 1080p resolution at 144hz is heating up a lot, the graphics are good, but I'm not sure that they feel good enough to pay such a heavy price on my GPU.	----->	6

73088311	Compared to other city builders, I find Foundation to be a LOT more welcoming and warm to players, rather than the sense of having to build the BEST city you can. This isn't a grid-based city. There isn't a certain way to build your city. In fact, I wouldn't really call it a city builder, but more like a village builder. You quite literally paint your village with the colorful paintbrushes at your disposal. Yes, you'll need to add some detail yourself, but at the end of the day, your people build and run the village.  Overall, I feel the game's art style and atmosphere really allow for players to run a village of hundreds or even thousands of people without worrying too much about how you'll need to keep the village afloat with trading or resource management, but how you'd like to see it grow. A lot can be said for this game's beauty when I bought this game literally because I thought the wheat fields looked good when not in a standard grid square. 10/10 wheat fields give me goosebumps	----->	7

73134919	I have visited and revisited this gem as updates have been rolled out. A very good city-builder/management game in the works!Early access (way back when) showed several novel and unique features, such as the automated housing and path/road creation that is completely organic. Now that several updates have been released, with a plethora of new features at the players fingertips, I eagerly recommend this for the fan of management-type games.One of the coolest features - the fact you can rename individual buildings. For example, I can leave the Wooden Fortress named... well, Wooden Fortress... or I can rename it to whatever my heart desires - 'Mythic Keep' or 'Tower of Impending Doom for all Who Invade Here'. You get the idea. Good fun and I now look forward to putting a few dozen hours into this game. You should too.	----->	13

I'm changing the review to positive although it is easy to tell that the current form of mining is only transitional.By reading your roadmap on trello I have a feeling that you are going to make the game's house leveling system into a Caesar III/IV or Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom, i.e., emphasizing the role of market and variety of goods. Their solution is classic but I would personally like to see something new.=================old review:i absolutely love the idea of a spontaneous city builder, however, the fact that I should not place rock gatherer near rocky mountains on the terrain ruins it for me. This game has an emphasis on pretty looks and natural feeling, but this one mindless decision ruins what they want to achieve.This is because berries and stones, as the fundamental resources of this game, are placed at a fixed location on the map, without any reference to their real world scenario. So I am not able to make a small 'stone excavation sector' of my town next to a mountain or pick berries next to forests(if I do not plant trees next to the berries), which means I cannot create a spontaneous and natural look for my town — who puts stone mining industry in the plain, on the grass, and in the middle of the town?? And why is there a small berry plot out of nowhere, within some highly condensed houses, and no farmlands around it??Unfortunately, the above scene is something that will happen all the time if you want the city to work efficiently.	----->	8

73225886	Really good game, quite relaxing actually. Quite expensive for what it is but I'm sure there will be much more to come. Speaking of which, 1.7 could be a Research/Education update that adds schools and scholars, and a research tree that allows you to research new refined materials, crops etcWe only have bad weather at the moment but a couple more events such as raids or plague would be interesting as well	----->	2
73227259	great game to relax to, I've always wanted a medieval city builder game and love the level of detail and micromanagement you get to do with this	----->	6
73234427	I overall recommend this game because I think it could really turn into something awesome. If you like building things and managing resources, it's a good game. That being said, it is an early access game so there will be kinks to work out.The game does need a better way of explaining what to do - certain aspect were difficult to understand until you really tried and read into it. Once you do understand it, it is easy enough.After that, the rest is nitpicky - could use a better overall interface (coming), the side quests for food and such could be a little more varied, maybe add in some more goals within the game.	----->	12
73235081	I'm really enjoying this game. Not the run of the mill CIV type system. Its not the easiest to get a handle on from launching and means you have to invest a bit of time in trial and error ( or plenty of google searches) to find out how stuff works. If you're up for game that doesn't hold your hand all the way and you have to work at solutions, it's rewarding ( and frustrating when you get it wrong...). The animation in the game is fun and very compelling. I found this fun and a relaxing game overall.  Now if I could just learn how to train my Novices into Soldiers I might undertake one of the military missions...	----->	8

73491497	This game is an extremely fun city builder. I'm excited for every update to this game and have found it to be quite replayable.I find the graphics to be charming and pleasing to look at as the city develops itself. I've found myself putting more time into developing the looks of areas I develop compared to other games I've played as I find them very aesthetic. The building edit tool that allows you to place small details to make structures look extra realistic and personalised is a favourite of me.If you like city builders where the population is mainly autonomous rather except for job allocation then this is a good game for you.Lots more functionality is planned for this game but in it's current state it's worth purchasing. It fills a niche of games that I didn't know I needed.	----->	17

73522685	Love the concept of this game, I was wondering how a grid less city builder game could be used as a selling point. And now I realize how much of a boon it is when you're building that cities grow outward naturally and everything can be placed, modified and built upon, from the starting point of a few settlers and no basic structures to a sprawling mideval city, love it! Hope to see more development in this game but for what's in the game so far, it's worth the 30 dollar price tag, considering the fact that full release games have half the content this one has still in early access.	----->	4

73532015	SpyParty, c’est un excellent jeu à jouer si vous avez un ami avec qui jouer.En effet, le jeu se joue en solo, mais l’intérêt de ce jeu est de jouer en ligne ou avec quelqu’un que vous connaissez bien. En effet, c’est drôle de stresser à savoir si on a été repéré, c’est drôle de stresser le joueur espion, c’est drôle de voir que le sniper a tué la mauvaise personne, c’est drôle de narguer son adversaire avec du pain au banane et c’est satisfaisant de réussir à faire une mission sans que le sniper s’en soit rendu compte!En fait, le jeu est juste drôle d’un bout à l’autre et offre au joueur la possibilité de personnalisé la partie comme il le souhaite. L’espion, sont tour venu, a le pouvoir de déterminer comment la partie se déroulera. Bref, petit jeu drôle à acheter à deux. Attendez un solde et prenez-le si vous avez un ami intéressé aussi à y jouer.	----->	1
73532427	Great game. I love the concept of building and it reminds me of age of empires 2 but newer. less battling though.	----->	3
73533989	A more relaxed take on medieval city-builders. Gives you a lot more liberty in how you approach/design your city, and you won't be rushed for time. Take it slow and look as your villagers go about their day and your settlements grows. And it is quite pretty.The game very much feels very Alpha, with a viable amount of content (buildings, production chains, monuments) but some gameplay mechanics are very shallow for now (trading, military). I haven't encountered any game-breaking bug or major performance issues, but there are numerous small glitches (mostly in the UI).Not yet a [i]great[/i] game, but certainly looks like the [i]foundation[/i] for one.	----->	4

73544172	This game is so fun to play. Endgame is where it gets long, but that's alright as it's a great game to have on in the background while you're doing other things. I am so excited for new content updates! It's so exciting to finish a kingdom and come back to the game a couple months later to start over and have a bunch of new features to play with!

73594288	After about 15 hours of gameplay, I can say this game has a lot of potential. The game mechanics work well; it's a great medieval builder with graphical style that fits well into the overall theme. It's still in early access at the time of this review, so I'm overlooking anything like missing or placeholder UI labels, miscellaneous bugs, or unfinished features.It takes a while to get a village established with steady treasury revenue coming in (using trade routes and the local markets) but once you're past that point and things are stable, it becomes more enjoyable and focused on people and resource management. I really dug into it during the initial release but became bored after hitting some of the first limitations with village growth, expansion, progress, etc. After taking a break and coming back to it recently, those limitations are now gone and I can make further progress; albeit with a new village since my older saved games were no longer compatible with newer game versions.	----->	4

73616372	I realy enyou playing this game. But there are some points i dont understand.(Version A 1.6.18.0729)1. MoneyMy total wealth wont rise (it's always between 0 and 200) even though my weekly balance is always positiv (between 30-100). Moreover the statistics have no explanatory power. There are heavy fluctuations. The overview over of the villager's mood has no explanatory power either, because the mean doesnt show statistical outliers. Especially with a big amount of villagers.2. HousesWhen I level up my Villagers they level up their houses too. But at the same time they move out and build new houses. Moreover the roomates move out too and also build new houses. So I have a lot of uninhabitated houses. And they remain empty.The  proportion of time and distance is not realistic. For example my farmer lives one house away of his farm. The Villageroverview says that he walks 30 min. to his work. 3. Overview of lacks of satisfaction. A geographical overview of the  lacks or supply of satisfaction (and wich needs in particular) would be helpful (like the areas), because, so far, you have to check each villager's mood individually and most of the time they are one the way to satisfying their needs. In adition the mood gets worse too fast and disproportionate. (A villager ist in a bad mood because he cant satisfy his needs during work even though there are enough possibilities).4. The demanded amount of churches and marketsThe demanded amount of churches and markets is absolutly unrealistic because it is to high. In my Village I had to build a church and min 3 markets in every sector.In addition the amount of Villagers that can get in the Church is too low. In a small church or chapell can get only 20 Villagers and in a big one 40. 5. Villager level up menuI can not see the way the villagers are sorted in the level up menu. This makes it hard to find one particular villager who lives in an area where it makes sense to level him up. Apart from this Foundation is a fantastic game with a lot of potential. The 30€ are a bit expensive at the moment. The game has to improve to be worth this price.As I said I have a lot of fun playing Foundation. I'm curious about the development and I'm looking forward to the finished game.	----->	9

73644833	I enjoy it, I played it frequently at some stage, I even supported the game through purchasing the in-game currency.The only thing I did not like was how much of a grind it still was and the limitations set on the player when grinding.I'd say this game still has potential to be great but unless they ease restrictions and let us do more grinding or get more from grinding I do not see the average person who plays this staying on for long - the devs need to pull their socks up and just allow their fan base who want to regularly play this game to grind less for the same stuff or grind more each day; these limitations are supposed to stabilise the in-game market but I feel that the limited early/mid game weapon/item customisation for your vehicle is very restrictive as a result. The people you are against with the approximate same vehicle score are people that use very good high-end or a large quantity of high-end weapons placed on a vehicle they designed to have as low of a score as possible, a solution that the devs could introduce is a increased armour score.	----->	20
73652805	I enjoy playing this game. It can take time getting used to the mechanics and the intricacies of game play. However, when you get the hang of it you can build some pretty awesome cities.	----->	7
73663448	I'm gonna start off with saying...bugs. Lots of bugs and glitches. At one point the game was sadly unplayable for me.However, assuming this game isn't one that is going to be abandoned by it's team and they truly take pride in this little gem they have here, it'll be a great little game, great! They really have something cute,fun,relaxing and enjoyable going here. A nice game where you sit back in your pijays, sip some coffee and kick your feet up.I would like more maps, perhaps randomly generated maps to keep things more interesting and add replay value to the game(There are only a set few maps right now that don't change). Maybe seasons too! Watch the trees change colour and it would add more depth to the game as far as resource gathering (summer,fall,winter,spring)Overall as it is now, I'd give the game a solid 7/10.	----->	8

73865749	Typical FPS, as the sniper you got access to only one weapon, but in the future there will be probably more weapons. As the spy you are only able to do missions because developer hasn't added weapons for the spy yet (game is still in beta so it's forgivable). And as for missions there is 8 of them, for example you can bug the ambasador (stolen from csgo where you can plant the bomb). Spy party has some elements from horror game because after death your corpse is trampled into the ground by the local guard. Generally you can play as Einstein, Agent 007 and more. I recommend this game especially for those who have friends and are really good at FPS games.	----->	2

73894234	After more than a decade on Steam, I can't tell you the last time I wrote a review. However, I feel compelled to take the time to write this review for this game. Foundation has the potential to be one of the best Medieval City Sim games ever in my opinion. The two main things that really stand out to me are the unique building design and organic city growth. The ability to create custom buildings that take advantage of the vertical landscape really makes the design aspect of this game special. You can build your Keep on the highest hill, your Lords Manor jutting out into a lake, or your church hanging off the side of a cliff. I find myself spending a lot of time just trying to find the coolest place to put my unique buildings. The natural growth of your city really makes things more interesting than placing 4x4 housing blocks all over. The pathing takes care of wasting time building roads. If given the choice, I normally end up making all roads straight and joining at right angles but I am so glad I can't here. Lastly, since purchasing this game, it has improved drastically. The developers have continues to churn out new updates while the modding community has helped produce additional maps and production chains.While it might be clear I really like this game, it is still very much in an alpha phase. The UI and build menus need quite a bit of work but I am sure that is already something being worked on. Honestly, fewer pathing errors than I expected but it happens. The quests are super minimalist and simple but are helpful. Would be nice to add some additional text and options to the quests to add some variability. I am really excited to see what the future holds for this game. I'd probably buy it again to support the team if a deluxe edition is ever released. If you're a fan of the city sim genre, you should definitely buy Foundation.	----->	33

73940686	This is a very fun game indeed. I have played just about every style of city build, from City Skyline to Banished even the old school Settles games. This is has some fun aspects like the free form building and the decorations of things like the markets or the Mayors Mansion. With that said I would say the one thing it its current state that it is missing is the Priest. I know, I know this is being put in in the future patch I just feel that if that's the case take the happiness negative factor out until it is as in one of my builds I have about 140pop but losing about 2 a day due to not having Priest in their churches. In closing I would give this a 4.99 of 5.	----->	9

74023281	隠れた大傑作。一筆書きタイプのパズルゲームだが、ライフ・お金・経験値というリソースをシビアに管理してなるべく稼がなければ行き詰まるところなど、たしかにローグライクの血が流れているのを感じさせる。慣れてしまうとほぼ確実にクリアできてしまう難易度だが、縛りプレイの材料や特殊ゲームモードが豊富にあるので飽きさせない。ワンプレイがさくっと短いのも嬉しい。一手単位でいくらでも巻き戻せたり、ライフゲージが画面下とはまた別に主人公の頭の上にも表示されたりと、遊びやすさにも気配りが行き届いている。……が、矛盾するようだがゲーム内容に関しては徹底的に説明がない。種々のユニットやトラップについては、やって試して憶えろとばかりにゲーム内のどこにも説明が出てこない。それはまだいいのだが、基本的なキー操作すらもゲームオーバー時のTIPSでようやく教えてくれるというのはちょっとすごい。特に重要な、CTRLキーによる「吠える」（隣接するユニットを驚かせてミミックかどうか確かめたり向きを変えさせたり目を醒まさせたりする）と、ステージスタート時のENTERキーによる「スタート位置とゴール位置の入れ替え」は、知らずにプレイしているとクリアが果てしなく遠くなる。さすがに不親切ではないかと感じる。追い打ちをかけるように、キーコンフィグがほぼ無いに等しい（のでキーコンフィグ画面で操作方法を知るということすらできない）。少々残念。	----->	0

74059285	I will recommend foundation to player who enjoy Banish or other chilax city building games. The housing zoning feature post a exciting and fun challenge for city planer to balance the residence and production/ service building in a region. However, foundation lack the competitive elements, i.e waging war within the map, as the Anno and Settler series. Thus this game is not for ppl who are looking for an intense experience.	----->	9

74115395	I now have more than 4000 hours playing and modding this game. The vanilla game felt a little empty to me, there were not enough different items to produce. Now with mods I have added many different foods, goods and materials which make the game both richer and more realistic. The modding support has been pretty good. Many things are available to change but there are still some gaps. The core game has everything you would want: build lots of stuff, towns that develop realistically, engaging economic play. Watching the villages grow into towns is very satisfying. Definitely not for the finger twitchers out there, the lack of combat makes the only struggle a slower-paced economic one.The speed of new development is slow. The upcoming version (1.9) will overhaul some of the key systems like trade and quests, which is welcome. It feels like the devs are approaching their final version of the game, but major updates are about a year apart.Graphically the game is great, a little similar to Cities:Skylines in terms of the style and free-form nature of placing things. The discord community is very good and contributes a lot to helping new players.Overall this is one of the finest games I have ever played and I hope it continues to develop.	----->	6

74340311	Super chill and charming game. Price-wise it's affordable and even it's in alpha state it looks well designed and running really well. While there is somehow limited things you can do, i can see myself spending at least few hundred hours without getting bored. Only thing fatally lacking is game modes, it's only sandbox. Campaigns and scenarios are essential for background lore, why we're playing? who we are? this are important questions and also encourage people to play more. There are tons of sandbox games which i played and enjoyed but none of them grown in me, after awhile i even forget their existence. But with story you can literally brand your game and there are many examples for that, such as Stronghold, Majesty, Anno, TAB, Settlers, AoW. I really wish you best developers, Foundation is a gem for sure. Question is how far you gonna polish it.	----->	9

There's also a hole where the gong is the hole, no markings whatsoever to make that apparent, and then there's a later hole with a gong and a ramp nearby and it's not the hole. Zero consistency. I also got stuck the boost bridges, on the post at the end of the bridge.On all the levels the ramps feel awful, everytime I have to use a ramp I have to learn that specific ramp feel.	----->	-2

74413082	It needs a lot of work but it's a good start. Good to play with friends. Local host games to play in house needs more work so it can be easier to setup. Using gaming controllers needs a lot of work. There needs to be a setup for it. As for gameplay it's fun and interesting. Your putting strength needs to be adjusted right at the beginning but you'll never know that if you never check the settings. There needs to be a tutorial for this game. The Jade Garden course is the hardest one and has some courses that just don't make sense. But in all it's a fun game and has potential to be a great game. It just needs work. I like it and I'll still keep playing it.	----->	18

74579554	Foundation is, for an Early Access Game, very well polished with only minor bugs from time to time.  Nothing game breaking whatsoever. If you're into Medieval city builder sims, resource management, or enjoy a laid back way to spend a few hours a day, it's worth paying the full price.  Replay value is there, although after several cities founded, the game tends to get a bit redundant.  I've only got a little over 12hrs in game and still look forward to getting home to expand my city, but can see that excitement waning in the near future.Devs seem to release patches and content on a regular basis, which is always nice to see with games in EA.In conclusion, I'd recommend the game to anyone looking for a casual city builder.  Really enjoying this one.	----->	15

74588800	If you liked the Settlers, this is a dream come true. I grew up on Settlers 4, and have never found anything that emulates the peaceful city-building phase as well as that game - until this. It might mean that I overlook some things, like I've definitely had to look up a few things in the wiki because they weren't explained well. But I'm just happy that I've found it, and look forward to supporting the devs as they continue on.	----->	11
74590680	If you like games like city skylines or Banished, this could be another great town builder to play. Yet it is different in lots of ways. Foundation is a far more relax game and i find its best to play when you want to play something that doesn't take up every brain cell to do so. Building a cute little town with no grids is calming and super fun! yet this game isn't finished and does lack content because its still in early access, yet it there are major updates every few months which always bring me back to the game and the modding scene is already booming and creating great content like new maps to keep you busy!All in all if you want to relax while playing a game and you like the art style Foundation could be the game for you! But that's just my opinion	----->	23

74651556	Devs have listened and rebalanced the economy. Foundation is again really enjoying city/colony builder.Some recipes are still over the top requiring too much materials (candles are the prime example requiring wax, iron bar and tools - this makes no sense other than depleting iron which is needed for tools and tools needed for too many things).AI is still an issue where game assigns a faraway builder even though there are builder's cam nearby. This really slows down the game in the sprawling settlements.AI and resources are weird - having a lot of flour  in the granary and water nearby while my bakeries do not take them, transporters do not bring them and so my people are starving as there is no bread production.	----->	-2

74704575	Great game. No combat at all, military is just sending your soldiers out in missions, then after a while they come back with rewards, or they don't come back at all. The industry of the game is good, well balanced and diverse. Some special buildings like churches are built in modules, with total freedom for creativity, if you have the resources. Some details should be polished and some features are not fully developed, but this is not the final game. Would definitely recommend it if you liked things like Settlers (the old ones) or Vanished. If you are looking for war, this is not for you.	----->	9
74718814	great. i like how the game manages the town itself, completly like a real town is managed, i also like how the game allows you to build anything anywhere and the mechanics of housing were you just zone out housing regions is a nice touch. however you have to assign people to jobs youd think the company would do, and i would like to see a market function instead of trade offers	----->	11

74781881	After times and times, I managed to move on from the beginning of the game.Initially, I had to give a bad review because it has been very obnoxious to understand how to make the good choices to not get stuck (for example how to not get villagers upset on their housing and residence zones...). The problem is that there is a lack of good instructions that explain everything in detail very clearly. But, after I solved this initial burden, the game is very addictive! I hope they will make better instructions with the official release of the game...	----->	-3

74809577	I had a very good time with that game in is Early Access version. Some mechanics are refreshing for the genre (house building and citizens pathway are pretty much automatics, you can customize the most important buildings, etc). It is challenging, but not super hard. I had some pretty huge issues that I was able to save. Others games like Banished are much more punishing.However, there is still place for improvement, especially for balancing the economic system (moreover for village over 200 pop.) Actually, some items are way more valuable then others who required a similar amount of basic resources. So basically, you are very oriented towards specific production lines, which limits economic options. Anyways, devs have already make huge improvements concerning military managements, production lines and added a lot of content to the game since I bought it. It well worth the price now and have a huge potential to be an a must have of the genre.	----->	16

74909037	I'm revising my original bad review to say this is a great game with some flaws.Once you figure out how to play, which is no small task given the vague instructions in the Help section.It goes smooth until your village expands and suddenly your villagers become basically malcontents. Even if you fulfill all their needs, it seems that they look for things to be unhappy about. ie, I have too much wood or food in my workplace. I wish there was a way to better regulate production while keeping the villagers happy. I'm not forcing you to eat it all, give some to the unemployed, just stop bitching. I've yet to find a happy medium. And if they can't find anything to be unhappy about, they will cause their own unhappiness by building houses too close together, then complain they are blocked. On the good side, it's an interesting game that will continuously keep you busy for as long as you want to play.Please note, this review may change as I become more familiar with the game.	----->	5

74922650	I love the middle ages. I love nation/city/society building games. This game is similar to like 20 I've played before, except that it's nice and slow paced. It's calming. The soundtrack and sounds of nature really just mellow you out. I felt no need to rush, there was nothing coming to attack me, and my coffers were still full even though I was still learning the game. I can't wait to see what my medieval town will evolve into.UPDATE: 100+ hours. My 3rd city I really spread like crazy. 250+ people. It was touch and go at about 130 but at I was flying high until about 250. The shield and cross happiness category tanked HARD. I build a monastery, more churches, expanded others. I build more watch towers, I had won battle after battle, stock piles of supplies but still it tanked. -70 happiness! Ridiculous. I am now certain I can't get past this slump. It's not possible given the AI.  Builders have even started sitting around. I had high hopes but this game appears to be at it's limit.I would still recommend it, if ON SALE, since the game is either buggy or incomplete.	----->	21

74947002	Okay, the time has come to change my review to a positive one. Yes, this game doesn't have a strong campaign like my beloved Stronghold. But it's a good sandbox where you can just enjoy the view and your settlers running around making paths in the grass, carrying wares here and there, going about their day.And yes, the 1.7 that brought the new UI was an absolute must for this game! Love the new UI, guys, you did a great job! Little things could be improved here and there, but the new UI is just miles ahead what you had before. Cudos to the design team!Why are you still reading this? If you like sandbox strategies like Settlers -- go ahead and try this!P.S. I wish to see more content in this game going forward, definitely could use more buildings and more variability.	----->	24

The problem: Not enough explanation of what's happening behind the scenes. As a newer player I'm normally clueless as to how to fix any problems my people have. I need more food, should I just build more bakeries? Or do I need more wheat farms? I'm sure these answers are out there but they really need more explanation in the game for these things as you run into these problems rather than forcing you to stumble around in the dark.I really enjoy the game, just hate how I feel stupid playing it most of the time, haha.	----->	3
74982717	I like to come home from work and relax by playing video games. Once you get the hang of happiness and desirability, the game is very enjoyable. You don't have to think about every move and planning every square foot of space - the villagers take care of their own housing needs.	----->	7

74997454	This game has been on my wish list for so long. I got a bit tired of Cities Skyline so i pulled the trigger here. I Love the organic growth of the town after painting residential zones. I absolutely love the visual constructions, you see the frame of the building then the stone etc, would love to see more detailed construction such as scaffolding and people working on upper/lower levels of buildings. Can't wait to see where this game goes in the future. :)	----->	7

75007795	The base game is decent enough, but the workshop is what really sells this game. There are some very, very talented mapmakers out there.  People that spend waaaay too much time making one course.  But it's the most fun you'll have with friends.	----->	4

75014322	This game is awesome. It's beautiful and addictive and relaxing. If you liked Stronghold, you'll enjoy this.I'm really glad I decided to give it a shot.BUTI hope the UI is placeholder UI, cause it looks super basic and bland and uninformative and a little overcrowded at the same time. It would've been awesome if it was like medieval themed UI of Stronghold ot smth. Also, it would be nice to have like a feedback button in the game (or am I missing one?) for reporting small bugs and misprints.	----->	24
75021252	Great so far, really nice camera angles and lighting when you zoom in close. Fun to build and with 4 hours in I still have loads more to do and learn. Looking forward to future updates and releases. This game has great potential.	----->	6

75021788	I could hardly stop playing. I played 8 hours straight as soon as it was installed. I love it. The controls were a little hard to get the hang of at first, but it wasn't that hard to figure out. The game doesn't tell you that you need to designate land for houses (or if it did, I missed it) and my people didn't build any for a while until I figured that part out. The rest follows pretty easily. Around hour 7 the game ran out of names, so all of my new people were 'novice woman #1324' &c, which I thought was funny.Edit: 59Hr update: I still love this game, and it keeps getting better and better.	----->	5

75054368	fun, a few bugs and a bit of lag when loading up	----->	-1
75057135	It is a very interesting game for no real battles like Age of Empires or similar. This is real strategic game play of how to build a town to a city. You do learn your lessons very quickly or suffer the annoyance of your whole populous while they leave you, to try and pick up the pieces of your poor planning. To building large churches, manors and more, their sizing and layout is all you, the creativity is immense.	----->	-5

75072702	Hello I liked the game idea but I found hard to understand quests as you can't click on them to see what you have to do as well as I don't always receive reword for finishing quests. I found a bit annoying that every window I open (click on villager or house etc.) it stay on the screen and I have to close it and how do you move buildings after it's already placed? One more thing I only partly read the instruction and later on I couldn't find it so I stuck in the game now as I don't know what to do and it is not explained in the best way. On the good note I believe if creators will make some adjustments to make it more easier to understand in the beginning then this will be good game.	----->	6

75091207	The game is definitely an early access title, make no mistake. Because of this there are lots of weird behaviors and balance issues.That being said, it already offers dozens of hours of entertainment in its current state, and I highly recommend you give it a go.	----->	-1

75120716	I'm not much of a review writer, but I just want to say a few words about this gem.I don't often play singleplayer games anymore.Usually they are boring, quick to end and not worth the purchase.In comes Foundation.Foundation is very fun to play for several reasons.1.) Freedom.You get absolute freedom when designing your village/city/kingdom.You can grow as much as you want, but you can also decide to stay small and just upgrade, see how much you can fit into a small space.The AI builds residences along the roads they create using pathing.Their pathing is not always perfect, but you CAN control it using forbidden zones.2.) ReplayabilityYou can create all kinds of settlements, leave it up to your imagination.You can create a massive bustling CITY with beautiful churches and bountiful taverns and flower gardens.Or you can do challenges with very hard to develop land and try to create a proper settlement.3.) PriceThis game is Early Access with an Early Access price.None of that full price Early Access crap.The game is not complete and it's still in Alpha.Many more things will be added so the game in its current state is worth around 20 - 30 euros/pounds.This is market value, not personal value.I believe this game is worth more than the latest Call of Duty or Battlefield based purely on the amount of fun you can have with it as well as the replayability.4.) The developers have a clear view of what they want to achieve.The developers know what they are creating and they are creating it.It's like a throwback to the 90s where games where made by a couple of people with big visions without deviating from their vision. In a world where most games are made only with making money in mind, this is a true gem. It's been quite a while since I've been able to write a truly positive review on a game.The developers have my full support in what they want to create.Note: Keep in mind that this IS Early Access.You WILL run into problems such as crashes, instability and bugs.So far I haven't had MAJOR problems with bugs, but I have had crashes.This game seems to have no problem with using all of your CPU and GPU resources and utilising them to the max the entire playthrough. Make sure your cooling is adequate.	----->	25

75130800	Bought this on the strength of the reviews, and on sale. My initial thoughts (subject to change) so far, 10+ hrs into the game: the bulk of my criticisms are surface level only. So far, the game's biggest issue is its lack of in-game pointers. Overall, I find the game pleasantly superficial,  I admit though, once you master the concepts, it is interesting and addicting.PROS:- The game in its current EA state is stable. No crashes so far, and I can tab in/out of it easily. - Its clear that the devs have focused on the minutia of resource management. This for me makes the game an exercise in technicality. You will have to plan your foundation out wel.- The villager animations are good. - I like the in-game camera. I'm able to zoom in and change the plane of view with my mouse.- I don't mind the ability to assign villagers to specific tasks. Having played Banished made me acquainted with this game mechanic.- Once you master the basic concepts, the game becomes addicting.- Overall, the game works very well for its Alpha state.- Lots of minutia with resource management.-Despite the lack of intuitive help functions, there are users who consistently help in the forums.-Once you master the concepts, the game becomes more interesting.CONS:- There is a decent learning curve. - the scaling UI function at 1.5x looks like it is out of focus almost. - The game requires you to paint the surface of the land to designate its usage, either for resource extraction, land usage. It makes sense, until your villagers report there being nothing to extract despite a nearby forest. I'm not really a fan of this. If there is a general yellow boundary designating my village area, then the villagers should extract the respective resource within its confines. - Resource management games after a while suffer the same fate, generally speaking: they get tedious. - The GUI is horrendous, and the devs are working on this apparently. The boxes and font sizes are too small. They are also counter-intuitive and are not user friendly.- There's a bit of a disconnect between the graphics and the GUI: the villagers are almost cartoonish but the GUI looks like a Microsoft Word document. The UI should compliment the graphics.- There should be a way to minimize the box on the left hand side that floats there. - No major single player campaign yet, other than quests.- The game lacks in its ability to explain how to get things done. Yes, there is a help menu before and in-game,but who wants to sit there reading for 20 minutes when first starting? There should be in-game pointers, arrows, clickable expandable links. There are audio cues already existing - why not add visual prompts? - I had no idea I could specify my bailiff to direct his mission until I clicked on one of the icons when he was ready for a new mandate. This needs to be made a cue or prompt in-game.- Making villagers responsible for building homes isn't inherently intuitive. We should have the option of first building the homes and beautifying the areas. Whether they upgrade or not should be up to the villagers.- The housing desirability is way too strict for starting missions.- Being able to build chains of items (i.e. gates or bushes) should be an option, especially if they are needed in the game.- Why is there still a village depot in the centre of my village despite me having a warehouse? - My citizens just idle in the centre of the square. - No day/night cycle. I hope the devs build this in.-No atmospheric weather, other than occasional rain. Some fog, clouds, mist, wind, would definitely compliment the game.- The trade panel needs rework with a way simpler GUI. It isn't clear how much I am selling or buying. It's clear in its build that the devs are an indie company. They've built a game with a lot of promise, but in order to make it more appealing to the average gamer, in-game prompts and cues should be added. We don't want to read a wall of text before starting a game. CONCLUSION:Another indie developer adding their own flavour to an otherwise bloated genre. Once you take the time and read the menu, restart a couple of times and get the hang of it, the game becomes more interesting. It took me around 20 hours of starting/restarting and reading the forums to get going. Now, the game is easier and more interesting. In its current Alpha form, it goes look pretty detailed with options I have to admit. However, it needs more to pop to justify the price, but it's a good start. If the devs can add campaigns, and more building options and challenges, then it will be worth it and stand out in the crowd. If you can stick out the high learning curve, it is worth it in this sense.	----->	33
75131681	While the game is still in early access, it is definitely on the road to being a great game. The game takes a little trial and error (and googling) to really understand the needs of the citizens and what you have to do to have a thriving town. You have to pay attention to the happiness of the citizens in order to really thrive, not to mention how much money you are spending and making. Overall, it's a great game that shows a lot of potential. Again, it is in early access so you will see some things that still need to be worked out such as not having a priest for churches or having citizens with names such as 'male #1050'. 	----->	6

75136994	I have downloaded this game one day ago and been enjoying it since. I love medieval games that can build and strategize as well. This game offers a way to grow while enjoying the aspect of building and managing the city you are trying to accomplish. I would suggest when playing do not go to fast and build to much but manage what you need and keep your happiness up because if falls then it keeps going to negative.	----->	10
75138638	GREAT game! This game has a lot of depth. You have to get used to all the concepts, but once you figure it out, it's really fun. The graphics are great and there is a lot of satisfaction watching your village grow. I highly recommend.	----->	3

75191569	This game is pretty decent already and has a lot of updates as time goes on. At this moment it is worth playing and I can only imagine where it will go. Adding a modding community via workshop was a terrific idea.	----->	7
75195906	Nice city builder. The lack of direct control is both refreshing but sometimes frustrating. Graphics are a great style, reminiscent of old Warcraft RTS. Top notch sounds and music, closely watching where this game goes as they progress towards release.	----->	3

75206589	So, I am  nearly 10 hours in at this point. I thought I wouldnt enjoy it as much as I have. It  turned out  to be  more  complicated than I  had expected, yet it makes it more fun in a way. The downside is that the larger the city, it becomes increasingly difficult  to maintain a higher happiness level.  Some resources dont seem to show in what I have played. It is very fun, but it has room for further improvements  in  future updates of the game, which would  make it even more enjoyable.	----->	6
75214297	Great escape from from the world around us at the moment. The game is still very much under development so there's a ton of room for improvement. Genuinely one of those games where you want the dev team to keep going & add ton of features.Resource heavy; my AMD7+2060 card +16GB RAM cries after I cross 100/120 people in the game.Mods are super stable & every one of them has performed well.	----->	3
75215285	I really enjoyed this game for the short time I played it. Plenty of suspense. The main issue is that there is no more than a few people playing it at one time. Waiting for another player to become available to play can take a long time. If there were more people playing this game it would be fantastic.	----->	-1

75245377	I love this game. Building and management games are my jam, and I am usually the OCD person who has to have everything on that perfect grid. This game doesn't really work that way and I'm surprised to say that I adore it. It's a whole new level of challenge to think ahead in every aspect, from how every building it will look on the map to placing everything according to desirability and trade access. And I love how you can construct the more complex monuments however you want! The church can be one building or a complex with a courtyard, for instance! I keep restarting because I feel like I can do better, but I'm excited to build my capital area and really go crazy on building some gorgeous places. ( Once I have tons of cash flow of course)Super easy and super difficult at the same time. 10/10	----->	17

75374958	Bought this game yesterday. Played with a buddy of mine.Although there is a only 5 x18 holes integrated within the base game. The game holds its true value from the creative ideas of the community making custom maps within the workshop. And some of those maps are fantastic. Highly recommend for any mini golf lover. I will note that this game is truly meant to be played with friends for the best possible experience. This game is still in early access. So you may find a few hic cups. Buy honestly. For £6 it's worth every penny.	----->	11
75393701	For an early access game, this is a very polished piece of work!The dev staff is amazingly helpful for any problem you may have, or question you want answered.8/10 - only because it isn't finished yet.

I imagine that the modding community will be very solid post launch and is being actively supported by the devs. Overall a great, in depth city builder, more forgiving than most but the emphasis is on creating beautiful, unique cities while still providing enough challenge to be addicting.	----->	6
75568879	Been enjoying this city builder a lot, I like the ability to design your buildings a little, and the interface is pretty good. Looking forward to expansion from the devs, especially more trade options.	----->	7

75618385	I don't know if I would recommend or not. I've been playing it all day. Fun. Things were going well. I finally built a church and everything fell apart. No more money incoming. -130 happiness. My people seem upset that when they go to the church they miss service or something? I don't know. It kind of just wrecked my save. I've lost like 20 villagers. 70 left.	----->	-1

75686967	This game fucking sucks and i wish i didnt spend 25 dollars on it. For a half assed game with shit graphics and horrible playability, this game is worth dirt in my opinion.

75701815	This is a great mini golf game with a bit of a learning curve. I love Golf With Your Friends, but it is definitely the easier of the two games. In Golf It, your power is based on how hard you move your mouse, so it takes a bit of trial and error at first. The maps are great, and the Workshop has an insane amount of content thanks to the active community. If you enjoy Golf With Your Friends or are looking for your first mini golf game to enjoy with some friends, definitely get this.	----->	8
75709471	Oh man is this game great. Foundation is a great take on the city builder genre that feels really fresh. Every update makes it better and better, and I have had the pleasure of watching this game grow and continue to grow. It feels obvious to me that the developers care about making this game, and are putting a lot of thought and care into it. If you're not the kind of person to buy into early access, at least do yourself a favor and wish list it for full release! The gameplay is grid-less, and has very cute animations for things, that still looks easy on the eyes from a distance. You can customize many aspects of your up-and-coming city, and the monument building system is really fun! (It lets you build landmarks piece-by-piece, and you can come back and upgrade them later too). The developers are also taking great care to make this game modding-friendly, which is a good sign for the community of this game. Overall I would say this is a great game for the price, and I'm always excited to see a new update for it in the game's news category.	----->	34
75725340	A totally enrapturing new city builder game. I've played city builders for my entire life, SimCity, SimTown, and all the way up to Cities Skylines, and this game has the potential to dethrone them all. This is early access so there's a many rough edges, but none of those rough pieces break the game in anyway. Play it now and say that you played the early access of one of the greatest games of all time. Huge thumbs up.	----->	3

75820197	Good fun F2P game, which is surely not super balanced, but cmon its kinda robot wars esque. I give it credit for being a mad max styled steel banger game :DYou can have lots of fun and get good parts without having to pay. Of course premium or some dollars will speed up ur grind.

75910592	I really like this little game and I'm excited to see where the devs take it.  I play this style of game a lot, and while it is EA it's pretty playable. You eventually run out of things to do, but since its Early Access I'm not too worried about it. I'm hoping to see more content soon.  I really like that you can just plop down buildings however you like, and I like the painting 'districts' tool if you will. My only complaint is that sometimes it's just so hard to get people to go to the market and get their stuff and then everyone is pissed at you because they don't have clothes, but that could just be placement choice on my part.	----->	4

76180603	Its fun	----->	4
76182525	Captivating. The simplest way I could describe it is it takes the colony-type gameplay up to a very comfortable and organic state. No roads are made by the state, but rather by how people choose to move. Being able to see and keep tabs on every villager is great and something few games do properly. Besides needing more names for villagers, it's not perfectly polished or intuitive in the early game so the tutorial is a must. No bugs that I could see so far besides the naming once your town gets bigger.	----->	8

76278768	Solid game even for Early Access. 40hrs in and I'm still on my first map.  The maps are big so I'm not even close to running out of available space to build things.Sure, there are still a lot of things missing from the game but thats not noticeable until you've unlocked everything, which I still havent done.I think the key to getting the most out of this game is not to rush unlocking the tech tree. Sit back, relax, and play the game at your own pace.	----->	-1
76304707	Good game. The maps are fun and can be challenging at times but then again thats what you want from a game. Also like the customisation options of your ball and that you can earn new skins or hats or trails as you go along. Search for player custom maps some of them can be so fun. Occasionally glitchy but otherwise a rather sound game would give a solid 8/10	----->	9
76330245	Great game and a ton of fun and laughter. The only con is really the price. I highly suggest the game to anyone , but will still tell people it's not a $25 game. at MOST maybe $15.	----->	4
76341881	One of the best independently produced, tight and responsive, competitive mystery games i've ever played. The fact that only 1 person is behind this masterpiece is astounding.

76344272	A wonderful game with a steep learning curve. I would highly recommend purchasing with a friend, as it can be hard to find a matchup in the lobby of somebody equal to your skill. This game is one of, if not my favourite games in my library. Would recommend this game to you if you like learning intricate strategies, as if you played a top player, they could shoot you for picking up a statue incorrectly.	----->	10

76446876	The game is very cute and looks polished visually for the most part. Most problems lie in the need for management.Pros:Game looks nice and curves are mostly smooth.The buildings are absolutely fun to do.Cities look and feel alive.Cons:The weather system needs to be expanded for more than just rain. Some storm clouds with lightning and other effects would go a long way in making the city absolutely picture perfect. Management needs to be expanded in terms of seeing resources on the top bar. Some resources are there but not all and having the ability to see, for example, wheat or wool would be very helpful for identifying problems in our supply lines.Help instructions needs to be expanded for everything. Maybe something like an encyclopedia book cerca 1302 would be a nice dash of realism and immersion for the game.More building options when you build a church and all those. The building is the best part but it lacks depth with so little to play with. Also a width adjuster would be a good addition.Overall great game though and would definately recommend! 	----->	25

76749348	The masterpiece of social deduction genre.The possibility to fail miserably by an unfortunate slip of a hand while taking out a microfilm from a book. A deadly shot, delivered to some poor soul just for being a little too interested in host's sculpture collection. All the tension, all the uncertainty. All of that creates an unforgettable mixture of emotions that i can see myself jumping in every now and then for a very long time.Unfortunately, there's clearly a population problem right now, which miiight be because of the buffy price tag. The updates aren't as regular as they probably should be. Yet i don't see it as a problem, since the game is already well playable. Alas, i'm curious about the traits on those characters' dossiers.Overall, you should definitely get it if you enjoy this kind of games (or could) and have someone to play with or if you have something else to do while waiting for people to join.	----->	6

The organic nature of path making and residential districts is brilliant and adds a whole new level to planning.  I'm looking forward to future mods and expansion (new eras, seasons with snow or drought and dependent harvests, more maps, maybe giant maps or servers with multiple players, etc.) in the future, but there are lots of mods/maps available already. This is absolutely the best game of it's kind I've ever played.	----->	12
76842853	the only thing i would improve it the names once to get 50+ people they use (exp.) male#1234 or female#1234 for their names. maybe this will be fixed? don't know other than that it is the best game I have every played on steam.	----->	5

77036031	It's a very cool game! I bought it back in 2014 for, I think, way less than $25 on their forum or something and I'm glad, that they made it to steam. I love the new maps and that it apparently still gets updated and even has players.The big reason why I still don't recommend this game is because you now have to pay $25 for a casual game with very little content aside new maps, that doesn't even give you the feature of playing against AI. You HAVE to play against one of the 20-50 strangers that are online if you don't have any friends willing to spend that money for a game with a browser-game-level of complexity.The multiplayer menu looks like it's from 2005 and I even had to put in my 6 year old password I used on their website, when I wanted to play online over Steam. Luckily I still had it saved in Chrome.Should be $15 and nobody would be disappointed.	----->	10
77038478	While the game is missing a few features, it is an incredibly good colony sim. Every patch seems to add something new and interesting to try out. If you are interested in a laid back colony sim, this is the right game for you.	----->	5

You start out with a couple boxes and some villagers and get to work chopping trees, mining stone, and picking berries. Eventually you work your way toward stone houses instead of shabby hovels and fields of wheat instead of just gathering berries. It’s one of those games where you sit down on your day off in the morning with your cup of coffee and suddenly it’s already bedtime. I’m very impressed that the game is still in early access. There are a few bugs, but nothing gamebreaking. It’s more funny stuff like the gargoyle still floating in the air when you delete the tower is was originally perched on. I’m very much looking forward to seeing what additional content the developers will release for the game!	----->	9
77120597	This game has a lot of promise but it is still very rough around the edges.  My first review was to not recommend it because I felt it was released way to soon in my opinion, with functionality only half implemented and a ton of placeholder names for things.  However after a couple patches it is now to a point where I am getting some enjoyment out of it.  some of the half implemented things (like priests in churches) have been hidden and everyone has a name so it doesnt look as half finished.  It still has a long way to go but it is showing promise	----->	4

77170294	Lovly game! It is still upgraded with content from time to time, but it has everything you need for a city builder game. I would like to have more maps, but the modding community is realy good and gives you some additional options and content. I like the game so far. Its simple and relaxing	----->	7
77178037	I am always skeptical with town builders. They need to have a significant amount of interesting things to build and challenges to conquer. With some town builders, you somehow get too many resources and nothing bad every happens. With Foundation, there always seems like an ebb and flow with resources, which is challenging and fun. The natural growth of the residential buildings is beautiful. Gone are the days of me building medieval towns like modern day suburbs. If you are looking for a good, challenging, expansive, medieval town builder, you can't go wrong playing this game.	----->	3

77261886	Fun progression based city builder, takes a few failed attempts to get the hang of it but the randomness of residential buildings / villager pathing creates a nice twist during a playthrough. It's enjoyable to build amenities new  buildings or fences around paths your villagers already created. Once you get the hang of things, the biggest challenge comes down to how you expand and still meet the needs of an evergrowing town.	----->	1

77318492	Hesitant review.... This game is fairly unintuitive, Extremely Slow, and fairly unfriendly to new players. The workflow is not obvious, and the tutorial is really lame (just a text manual to read, talk about immersion breaking). The gameplay is SO SLOW. I literally just left the game running at max-fast-forward speed (3x.. it should go faster than that if this is the intended gameplay..??) and left the room for 15 minutes in real life so I could get the intro tasks done....The world itself and the art style is very beautiful, and I'm excited to see the gameplay fill into its potential. I don't think I can recommend this to most people who may play this YET though because it's not easy, and not very fun. But maybe for people who have TONS of patience. Hopefully the devs make it easier to get started.	----->	3
77318566	wow	----->	4
77323732	I love the game. As of right now, I've clocked over 30+ hrs of game but it took a while to get used to--This is probably what most people who give a bad review has a gripe with.A couple of things I wish in the game:- A more new user-friendly 'tutorial' at the beginning of the game that lets you experience the tutorial rather than read it from the in-game manual. Perhaps a paused-game tutorial every time we build new buildings or upgrade citizens so we know what icons are which? Also, maybe lock a few buildings that need prerequisites (like no blacksmith until iron is available for the first time) to prevent mistakes since 'so and so in exchange for so and so' can sometimes be missed to read.- Bigger text. People with terrible eyesight like me might have to lean a little closer before being able to read some things.- Bigger buttons. Some buttons you might accidentally press because they're small and right next to each other.- The UI feels way too small and crowded. Maybe having a few of the option buttons on the bottom bar, or even the resources displayed a little larger on the bottom while the other buttons for options on your town are on the top?- Quest box feels a little odd looking at it on the left side of the screen. Maybe on the right side or have a quest drop down from the top bar?- Also maybe 'mass delete/bulldoze/edit/move'? It's handy sometimes when one makes a mistake putting down decor in the wrong area or just wanting to transfer them elsewhere.Other than that, I love the game. It currently takes some getting used to for new players. It gets more enjoyable when you get used to it, but I would absolutely love it if the UI got better and more visual and new player-friendly.	----->	-5

77386045	The grid-less system is great, really makes expansion feel organic and natural. Seeing the houses and paths automatically generate is so fun as well.  Early Access so some features buggy and others missing but as is would easily put it amongst the likes of other indie citybuilders already.  Its a hefty price-tag, but if you are sorely missing a town-planning resource management type activity like i was, this is more than ideal.	----->	4

I do think some of the  advancement is too great for some areas and too less for others  Kingdom is one example  where i think it's two high to get to the next level.	----->	12

I'm supposed to be productive and I'm sitting in front of this game for HOURS. 11/10 ruined my adulting, and the game isn't even finished yet.No really, I'm in love with the creativity I can put into major buildings and walls, and the generated houses. It looks so organic and beautiful and you spend a lot of time carefully placing everything. I enjoy making little crops of trees and walls for aesthetic reasons, and watching the little guys work away. Excuse me while I create my empire of round, fluffy sheep.	----->	6

77631911	Fun little village building game. Still quite raw, as at (16/10/2020). I have sunk a decent amount of time into it so far, and it really succeeds at drawing you in and keeping you playing.However there are some issues I'd like to see addressed by the developers in order to really recommend it at it's current price point:- The promotion system needs work. Very annoying if you're playing at 3x speed to have a window of about 2 seconds where you have to be actively watching the calendar with your mouse hovered, ready to pause the game in order to promote your villagers. You should just be able to access the promotion window whenever you want once you unlock it. Needlessly annoying and easy to fix quality of life change.- No option to clear resources from the map that you don't need for the Aesthetiiiic. Reeee!- Villagers need too much church. Really need to look at scaling back the villagers requirements in regards to faith. Their other needs are fairly well balanced.- The workplace menu is either buggy or doesn't update often/quickly enough. Issues such as showing 1 villager working in two different places at the same time or showing 12 villagers working at different jobs when you only have 10 villagers.- A lot of aspects of the game aren't particularly intuitive or explained well in the tooltips, could do with much more comprehensive building descriptions and help menus.Of course this is to be expected with a game that is still in early access. I think it can be a really good game if  some of these issues are addressed as it continues in its development.	----->	11

77708889	Foundation is an interesting supply-chain management simulator that is based on medieval times.  It doesn't take a whole lot to get the whole ecosystem out of wack or having overgrowth problems which wildly throws off the supply chain. Different stages of the game have different challenges, some you can overcome, others you cannot. There are more than a few choices when it comes to crafting and buildings, but other systems like trading are clunky and not polished yet. The game continues to be developed and the results show, there is an acceptable amount of quality and interesting upgrades to this game that keep me coming back and wanting more. The graphics are very cute, the music is pleasant, I would recommend this to others who enjoy similar simulations or supply chain games.	----->	8
77709158	I first avoided this game, or at least I was hesitating to play it. The reason for that was that I thought the game would be pay to win, but then I found out it wasn't.I started playing and I am really enjoying it now! I wish the playerbase would be tid bit bigger but you will always find people to play with and against.It's quite a fun game, the best part about it is that you can build any monster of a vehicle and rek people with it. This game is a blast!	----->	8
77720032	Not a bad game very fun and addicting. As it's a work in progress I hope to see more content along the way. If you take it slow and do everything you possibly can it plateaus at about 15 hours for me which isn't terrible but I'd definitely love to see. The art style is pleasant as well as the music and building. Would recommend for someone who likes chill building sims.	----->	12

So, I am starting it over because now I have a better idea of how I want to play. Definitely worth buying it!	----->	8

77889905	first review ever just for this game and i have over 100 games rn. this game is amazing so far. ive only played about 3 hrs so far but have for sure got my $33 from it. and im still in early game.the best part for me is how the house get built in their own spots so not just box grids the whole time, and i love how much you can customize every building in such diffrent ways. if you like city builder and mangment games or if you just like to make pretty looking towns, this is the game for you. and they appear to be adding new stuff often enough. great game and fastest ive fallen in love with a game ever, or almsot as mush as skyrim did first time playing.	----->	19

78154688	EARLY ACCESS AT TIME OF REVIEWIt is a very fun and interesting game. Very similar to Banished but with more organic growth. The paths and houses that just form every where is something i have always wished was in other builder games like this!! I hope the modding community goes nuts and adds lots of new buildings and resources like it did with Banished. It is a bit shallow at the moment, but still in early access, so that is to be expected a bit.Soldiers and military missions are a cool different way to gain resources. The  different levels of the Kingdom, Church and People is fun to work through an unlock things. I do hope the devs add more to these. I did unlock all of it pretty quickly and now am just growing and managing my town, but not getting new things.Overall very fun and not many mechanical or system issues for the point its it at. Very smooth if a bit shallow	----->	24
78156475	better than golf	----->	2
78164273	A calm and serene city-builder, unique for the way roads and housing are created organically, as needed, by the NPC citizens. Easy to make a beautiful bustling city, but difficult to master and maintain happiness.Early access means sometimes things are bugged or unusable, but each month brings new angles, resources and trading options.Predominantly a Supply Chain Maintenance game, the skill comes in carefully placing, staffing and organizing the various resources, from acquisition to refining to complex construction, often requiring 2 or more second-stage materials.People who will love this game: lovers of Tropico, Anno 1800, Stronghold, Frostpunk, Cities SkylinesPeople who may not enjoy the game as much: people looking for a battle or military angle, those who may get confused by complex trade and economy management	----->	10

78177321	Nice game, runs very well. I find that no matter how i play i come to a point where i can just no longer progress at a pace which i am happy with (I am quite impatient). Played in early access but did not find that any of the missing structures caused me too much of an issue. Nice game to play casually and is very much a pick up and play when you return to it. Nice set up with the build menus, tutorials easy enough to follow for quite a complex system for a game of this type.	----->	3
78178020	Good fun medieval city sim style game. In depth production value chains and heaps of options back up by nice visuals.

78299907	A wonderfully charming game that is an excellent blend of city builder, colony management, and building sandbox. The UI could definitely use an overhaul but this is early access, and the core gameplay is very solid. This has great potential and I'm excited to see it develop!	----->	12
78305667	Things are getting fixed.  Housing seems better.I'd probably wait, but I'll give it a thumbs up.	----->	0
78306716	I would recommend this game if you are a casual player. I am a very casual city-builder and I had a lot of fun with the modular buildings and the limited managing that was required.However, if you are a very motivated efficiency minmax focussed strategy game player than the game in it's current state probably won't be as much fun for you. Once you have unlocked everything the only thing that is left is growth. And that is where, due to the way the mechanics are currently designed things can get really tricky and less fun for both the casual player as the big minmaxer strategy player.I did have a lot of fun though, so I would totally recommend it if you think of picking this up.	----->	22

78323125	I can't get enough of Foundation.It's like they took the best parts of all the city builders out there and combined it into a masterpiece.The towns I created felt incredebly alive and immersive, thanks to the game dropping grid-based building and instead allowing for completelly free placement of objects.Also villagers automatically draw roads, which is a feature every game of this genre needs.Absolutelly worth it's price!	----->	11

78356516	This game is very addicting. It is a chill solo player that not only passes time but calms you down. There are a few things that need to be fixed but for the most part they update it regularly and there are no major issues that break the game. I enjoy it every time I play it.	----->	3
78370504	favorite parts of the game: watching new housing go up by villagers.placing new buildings and watching my stockpile grow.planning the village out.least favorite part: having to keep building churches so my villagers all have faith (built tiny churches is why :D )finding out some 'decorations' are more than that, they have a function (training dummies are a MUST for a military)not having marble or other minerals right away (get a bailiff office asafp to find ore and marble, also costly)None of those least favorite things are drawbacks, just things I found annoying.  Gameplay is amazing, bugs are few and far between (I don't think I've encountered one yet except for some buildings looking funny, and at one point was over my road into town for some reason :D ) and honestly the progression system makes sense (once you learn the promotions are done with a great hall... look above for annoyance reference).All in all a fun city building game that's addicting to play.	----->	12
78384427	This is actually a positive review... wasn't ready for it when I bought the game... im scared.	----->	2
78396876	If adding kingdom type such as Middle East or Asia sure awesome	----->	4
78409224	First I want to start by saying I think the developer is charging way too little for the game.  I saw the price tag and I thought this game was going to be sh#t, but after playing it for almost 100 hrs with my work buddy's I have to say this game is fantastic and very well polished to be an early access.  From game play to editor this game is tight.  If I were the developer, I would pump the price up to, at a minimum, $24.99.  This game is too good to be so cheap.  I think most people would rather pay more for a great game then a bad one.  I have nothing negative to say about this game.  The developer is responsive, the community is great, the game is great and exceptionally fun.  The editor is so good and will only get better.  I can't wait to see the end result of this game.	----->	11
78410564	Great game, Hoping for more features such as trade, and more culture to be added and this will be the next best city builder since banished	----->	3
78413587	Overall I like this game, its smooth and runs well. The game also allows for some real customization of building your town/city/empire.I do recommend it to support the development.However! There are some issues with the un-modded game. Currently my cities max out at around 200-250 settlers as the happiness levels are very unstable, housing is difficult and keeping on top of supplies is um-manageable at times. As an example you need new villagers to expand your city but they don't come if the happiness level is below a really high bar (like in the 90%'s) villagers continue to not build housing even when very desireable areas are available to build housing, also providing for your population is confusing, I currently have many many resources and infrastructure but still end up lacking to offer food/clothing/etc which is confusing even when building a very conservative city.This ultimately creates a cycle of unhappiness and makes it really hard to build a late stage city with all the nice things.Lastly, some of the maps just disappear at map boundaries which kinda ruins the beauty of some of the maps.I would like to see the game in a balanced stage as it's really fun and beautiful.	----->	17
78419960	Game is fantastic, and a joy even when you aren't actively building. Watching them live their lives is satisfying	----->	3
78431294	Lots of fun, needs more modders that's willing to overhaul stuff, but it's in a really nice point right now. Game updates regularly, but is only in Alpha right now.	----->	3

78443930	I can only play this game on weekends because when I sit down to play it, suddenly at least 10 hours have elapsed. I would like to see a castle builder option and more expansive wall building with turrets.	----->	2
78452197	a very relaxing game. UI needs some work to be a little more friendly but overall you pick it up quickly enough.Deeply satisfying to play and challenging as your city grows to stay balanced. Well done team.	----->	2
78461058	Fun and provides just enough challenge	----->	-1
78467084	The premise of the game is great, but the execution is lacking. Playing version 1.6.23.Resource management is the driving force of the game. And yet the ways in which the resources are distributed from their origin throughout the town are convoluted and unexplained. The trade system is also confusing and poorly explained. After hours of playing, I still don't know what all of the resource and trade checkboxes in every menu actually do when I toggle them.I dislike that if I destroy a resource camp all of the material within it disappear. There should be a way to command that the resources be removed from the camp. I also learned the hard way that if you change which resource is stored in a warehouse, the current inventory is destroyed. The military system is relatively pointless. The envoys and monks are also pointless by midgame. I also have issues with villagers walking past multiple available markets and wells to stand in the city center with their needs unfulfilled until it time for them to return to work. The game also frequently freezes upon exit.Cute game, but it is still a bit unbalanced and feels unfinished for being at version 1.6. It becomes repetitive long before you've unlocked everything. I would not recommend paying full price for this title.	----->	-8

78515793	A very unique city-building experience that has been pleasantly surprising. I began playing in early access (Oct 2020) and there are a few quality of life features missing but nothing that fully detracted from the core game. There is plenty of content here for a lot of hours play and once the random map generator comes in, things will only get better.	----->	-2
78518824	A gentle city builder, the main challenge is in the supply chains, the placing of industries and resources, and in making sure your people are supplied. No on-screen fighting, a bit of trading and commerce. Nice graphics, reminiscent of Settlers at times, in a good way. Still in development, more to come.	----->	2

78623686	What chill fun time building a medieval city. There really isn't a game like it. Finally a game not tied to a grid system and a game that lets you go at your own pace. The developers have been slowly adding new features, and I've been revisiting the game every now and then for a couple hours. Very enjoyable, and absolutely recommended.	----->	6
78628580	A fun little game 8/10, a good relaxing game to just take a break and watch you're squad of frontiersman slowly turn into a bustling city. Personally would recommend buying on sale while it is a fun game it's still just like all the other city builders but it has much potential and with constant updates I think this will be a good one.	----->	18
78637255	fuck yes	----->	-3
78641196	A game that could destroy friendships. It looks fun and innocent but once you and some friends make a game and switch up the setting, it makes me wanna throw my monitor out my window and wash my pc in water. I just wanna grab my friends head and shake it violently for changing me into a stupid shape.	----->	-1
78642070	Foundation is the game i've been looking for ever since Banished got abandoned. This game has so much potential and is already one of my favourites. The UI is a little finicky at times but once you get the hang of it its okay. The gameplay itself is addictive.My only concerns are the game getting repetitive onces you've completed the Estate section. I'm hoping they add more to that. My other concern is the villagers consumption, after promotions i'd like to see how much each villager is going to require so I can monitor a production and consumption level.	----->	4
78655027	A fun and relaxing game, even in its most earliest of states. The framework is in place, hopefully the developers continue updating this game and making it something truly great.For your early investment, you'll easily get a dozen hours or so of village building. It takes a while to get the hang of the production chains and even with a restart or two you'll be rapidly expanding in no time.Some of the buildings bug out when they are being built. Builders will refuse to deliver a particular item to a building and the only option is to delete the building or part of a modular build and place it down again. This usually solves it and is a minor inconvenience at most.If you like village/city builders and you don't mind early access games, then I would definitely pick this one up.	----->	4

78681420	a relaxing, charming and gorgeous medieval solo-player city-builder that is a must-have for any fan of the genre.Organic town development and customizable , modular monuments make for creative building, and unique town designs that are a delight to the eye.The devs are very active on the game and engaged with community via the various social media platforms, releasing frequent patches/updates, fixing bugs, and adding new content.The well-supported modding community have already created a swathe of additional content that dove-tails into the main game effortlessly through an in-built game UI.	----->	12

78691145	Fun, relaxing medieval city builder with a unique and vibrant art style.One of the features that sets this one apart is the modular building mechanics and grid free structures. Gives your city a very organic feel.The feature set of this game has been constantly evolving but there's room for a lot more. This game definitely has a strong 'Foundation'! Would love to see this game be completed and get a full launch, not falling into the early access trap.My Rating: 8/10	----->	8
78702436	Thumbs up from me. Lovely graphics and sound, great gameplay.

78707122	I was reluctant to get it at first because of it still being early access, but this game is incredible.1) It runs extremely well even on older laptop (lower than recommended but better than minimum specs) and I haven't encountered any simulation lag whatsoever. 2) There is just so much to do. Love how you can design your own castles, churches, taverns etc. and mix them all together to create unique building complex.3) Despite being relaxing it also provides some challenges (mainly regarding logistics and keeping everyone happy). 4) In-built mod manager! It is so convenient and easy to use.Bear in mind that the game doesn't hold your hand pretty much at all and it can be a bit challenging to understand how things work and how to properly manage your villagers. I enjoyed the learning experience, but it possibly might discourage some people. When you first start, mistakes can easily pile up and make your town crumble. I feel like currently UI is the weakest part of the game, although I am sure it will be improved by the time this game leaves early access.	----->	7
78713300	Good	----->	0
78714848	A medieval city builder with a difference.Pros: Beautiful visuals, the sound track, an easy going pleasure to grow your settlement from hamlet to metropolis. Cons: Lack of villager names, housing system somewhat opaque. Maybe the fog is a little strong. Could do with better documentation of some systems.	----->	6

78734218	It still needs a lot of work (a lot of my friends crash out and need to restart the game when we change maps) and the list of official maps is not very long (six or so maps). But even so, with the really good graphics/physics engine and all the insanely creative maps in the Workshop, this game is a steal at its current price.	----->	1

They already have built in mod support and an in-game mod browser which adds a lot to the playtime. I've sunk 35 hours in the last week into it and plan on keeping an eye on the development. It seems like the developers are making at least a monthly posting so thats a good sign.	----->	11

78824900	You learn the basics of the game (gathering resources, buildings and supplying villagers needs) very quick. It's a relaxing game in which you can let out your medieval creativity.

78843783	I don't normally review games, but this one deserves it.Compared to most city building games where you spend ages placing paths only for your people to ignore them is infuriating.

78868022	Nice Relaxing,	----->	0
78893024	A very relaxed city builder. It's hard to overstate the difference the gridless layout makes in the looks of the village. Having the villagers create their own paths as they walk so I don't have to try to fit buildings around the arc of a street is such a great way to design.It's ridiculously easy to succeed, and once it's fully developed there might be a challenge mode that encourages you to crank up the speed and try to meet some overbearing overlord's quotas for polished stone or soldiers or whatnot, but for now, it's a great little software toy with its own moments of achievement.As an example:I built my village center on the side of a hill, with farmland in the valley bottom and a little church on the next gentle rise. It looked like a nice spot for a house, so I added a small residential zone next to the church and was just rewarded by the villagers deciding to put a house on the spot after about two months game time. It felt like the first time I successfully passed on my crown in CK3, was re-elected in Tropico, or won the race to build a sought-after wonder in Civ. So very incremental, but rewarding.	----->	22

78977468	Its a cool game, honestly its a better settlers 2, if anyone has played that youll see many similarities though not exactly the same.I would say the one thing that settlers 2 has over this would be combat, it still managed to be a slow paced game but it would give you the opportunity to make an army and fight for territory by taking over military towers. i just feel that eventually ill build everything then im gonna be like ok now what and ill get bored after that. needs an extra layer of something to keep you interested in my opinion.I do like the game and ive been having fun playing it, id recommend it if you want to chill out and build a town	----->	11

78991722	This is very much a puzzle game which encourages you to find the best solution to procedually generated stages, without allowing entirely perfect solutions. A wide range of unique monsters and gamemodes stretches the playtime out to several hours and greatly increases replayability.No matter who you are or how much prior experience with puzzle-solving you have: You can rescue grandma, using your BRAIN and your BARK!(Also, please note the Trailer and preview images are somewhat outdated. The UI, sound composition, etc. have been refined well after the release date.)	----->	13

79003892	I tried this game about a year ago, since then it did get improved properly, but it is game for specific players. I really like sistem of decorating some buildings and how they can be enabled to auto upgrade and how roads are made by your villagers. (That never blink and it really makes them bit creppy) You also can expand your territory by getting bordering areas for resources to extract.Graphics are really nice, but they really could implement day / night cycle and do a bit more on weather effects.Music is nice and while I fully agree that in this type of game does not need agreesive music and more relaxing, it still is a bit tooooo slow for my taste and could be a bit more improved,Game does have really big micromanagment system and you will not have just wood / stone / water resources. I did not fully counted but there is at least 10 but still you have 4-5 essentials others are for stuff like tents in different colours.You also can trade with neighbouring citiesOne thing that I think developers really should improve, or at least put options for modifying is size of UI itself. Letters in menus are reaaaaly small and people who have troubles with eyesight could have problems on seeing them. Games that this game reminds me most are mixture of Settlers and Northguard but with no fighting like in those games. Would I recomend this game yes if you are not afraid of managment and like medival themed games where challenge is more in controling your settlement and building up great manor and decorating it best you can.	----->	15

79016600	Fun little medieval village builder with a good amount of content.With the workshop you can push more content into this game, with a built in mod loader so each save can have different mods!All in all, subjugating peasants to make me a castle while they run out of bread is good fun!But, I mean, they could just eat cake.	----->	8
79020787	Base game has good mechanics. Lots of fun and the putting feels very interactive since you use the mouse to control the speed (and angle/spin if you turn that on). Just make sure you tinker with the putter speed so you aren't launching the balls into a low earth orbit by accident. The game really shines with the workshop maps. There's a bunch of really good map creators with some awesome maps! The YuNo ones in particular are amazingly well done. The local hotseat feature works well so you can play with friends on one copy. The game plays nicely with Parsec for your pandemic ready local hotseat as well.	----->	14

79038642	Really nice, aesthetically pleasing town sim. My biggest problem with the game in it's current state is the AI can just bug out sometimes. Builders refusing to build until you destroy and replace and production chains breaking down because odd pathing behaviour sends a villager constantly trying to meet its needs in a very unoptimized path. The game can go from extremely laid back to on fire pretty easily but it's forgiving if you mess up here or there. It can be annoying to figure out what's going on and why when you're starting out but you can learn the mechanics of avoiding annoying pathing pretty easily. I'd recommend this game if you liked banished but want something less punishing for making mistakes.	----->	-9

79153138	Golfit is one of the most fun golf games around. It is more of a party game than anything else. You are required to hit a ball through a series of trickshots to try and get to the end and since you can do it at the same time as your friends, you can hit each other and get in each others way. Try and knock your opponent out when they finally manage to get through a hard area or give them a little tap to ruin their shot. Either way, it is a nice and fun party game.	----->	8

79228655	As it stands, it's a charming game in the city builder genre. I enjoy the way the game's mechanics cause your towns to grow organically. Paths are built based on where your villagers walk, and they choose where to build their homes within the zones you place. The modular building tools for things like churches and manors give you some decent creative freedom in how they look. The UI is a bit rough and the soundtrack, while good, is repetitive. But overall it's an entertaining game in a genre that desperately needs more games like this. I'd recommend trying it if you like city builders like Banished or Tropico.	----->	18
79235169	great game	----->	3

79366302	Very good game, I even reccomend the editor mode. Making a map was a lot of fun.	----->	3
79369101	This game has very much potential - In the most neutral way.Certain things like villager AI, military, trade and treasury really need some polish before this can be considered a full game.The devs are taking their time with the updates, but they make sure to make those updates count. In its current state, this game is still very much playable and enjoyable.	----->	2
79378519	One of my favourite games to play. Especially fun if you have a few friends to play it with. The community is very welcoming, there is a growing player base and the dev Checker is super nice as well :) Every game played is satisfying and fun, you could just be looking for a good time or try to scratch your competitive itch this game can provide! 100% worth the money, some people thinks it's too expensive, but I think every penny was worth it, Checker works really hard on the game and that money is very beneficial to help support himself and the game development. If you have the cash and are looking for a good time, this is the game for you!	----->	26

79425502	I wish there was a creative mode because the normal game is pretty slow but other than that it's pretty fun	----->	9
79431106	This is extremely relaxing and quite fun. I loved Banished and this seems like a chiller, more flexible version of it. Your villagers don't keel over and die if you look at the funny or mess up, so that is pleasant. I'm really looking forward to seeing where the development goes with this.	----->	4

79481707	A nice and chill little citybuilder. While still in early access, it offers a very nice experience.Seeing your little settlement grow, somewhat organically, is ever so satisfying. Around the 250/300 inhabitants mark I would recommend looking into some relevant (un)balancing mods to keep your population happy. Or become a master at logistics. I go for mods. The recent major update brought a lot of fun new content, and I cannot wait to see what more they add in the future. :)	----->	12

79503023	Very detailed and engaging gameplay.Things to improve:1. Cash flow in terms of positive and negative in the top bar is ambiguous. Money is going up while the indicator is in red and vice versa. Not clear what is going on.2. Residents leaving their jobs are not visible to the player in order to replace them. Jobs management is a tedious type micromanagement. There should be a mechanism to observe job positions and their statuses in a single windows and there should be warnings when someone leaves their job etc.3. Battle arrangements are not clear. Who wins and loses due to what are not clear to me. There is no indication as to how to train a soldier towards a higher rank.4. This game needs a professionally designed tutorial for sure.	----->	4

79537973	Loving the simplicity but looking forward for future updates that gives this more content.	----->	0
79541542	A game that you can truly get lost into for hours... Amazing features include not ever having to build roads or houses and also being able to build almost any building exactly the way you want it to. Well worth 30 bucks and still in early access so expect nothing but continuous improvement from their team.	----->	2
79543102	Its a great game, what can I say, I love it. Always waiting for more content and it keeps coming, albeit not as fast as i would like but that isnt stopping me from playing it for almost 100 hours.I know Banished is the Benchmark, an in my opinion, it is as good as the unmodded Banished even now.The Maps are big enough to get 1000 townsfolk and its pretty easy once you get into the expanding your resources as your town grows, just like Banished, if you neglect to expand, then the demands of the people cannot be met, although they dont die, they leave and no-one else joins.No breeding of people yet, no schooling, no idea if the yield increases as the people level up.War is also pretty simple and gets you lots of money, you just wait until your liklihood to win is is extreem and then it fills your bank up but its Early Access and lots more to come.I recommend this, you will not be disappointed for the price and the early access is bug free and feature rich, modding is already taking off so you can see that as long as they keep updating the base game with features like human life cycle, illness, more crops, improved military (raids) and improved trading, all the things on the timeline, it will be a great game, perhaps the best in its genre.	----->	27
79544652	Beautiful graphics, pleasant music, easy to learn, difficult to master. Foundation has everything you'd want out of a city building game, with a few extra side quests that add some challenge and excitement.	----->	3

80024148	This is a fun little game you can play with a friend or with strangers, but I had the most fun trying to outplay my friend.One time I had problems with the game, so I wrote it in the games forum. The developer told me how to fix the problem. Had no trouble with the game since.	----->	3

80522627	please continue to add production chains, also a diplomatic option of sorts,  ability to have allies/enemies and having it possible to be attacked. Don't know if these are being worked on but would really make this game exceptional	----->	3
80524762	Causal building game with minimal objectives. I like some of building aspects as it pertains to the customization of their looks. Prefer rock over wood? Taller tower? Chimney or no chimney? It's probably an option. I'd love to see a co-op or multiplayer version in the near future.	----->	4
80536938	Don't let the adorable art style fool you.  There is amazing depth to this game already and it isn't even finished yet!

80920961	It's easy to lose time in this game, it's challenging, colourful, easy to play and it allows you to custom buildings like church, lord of manor, and more. I'll recommend  for those in loved for city building gaming.	----->	9
80921911	This is probably my favourite game I've played in general. I have always been into building and resource games since I was a kid but never really connected with the city builders. However this has become my favourite game. Not sure if it's how adorable the NPCs are or if it's the fact it's a medieval setting but I love this game. I have played multiple saves and still haven't got very far, it is hard but it also allows for longer playing time and more problem solving than is required for most games. I love the challenge and the music for the game is fire. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes adorable animations, village building, resource management, and chain supply type stuff. I still haven't become bored even after 122 hours. I still have more I haven't explored yet.	----->	11

80934576	This game is a lot of fun and as people have said, it just needs more. Id love more upgrades to the housing levels, maybe other things around the town as well. It feels very limited on who you can trade with and what they will buy. It would really make it more enjoyable if you could discover other neighboring cities to trade with that would purchase other items.	----->	6

You can 1v1 or 2vs2, the latter being my favourite. If you haven't played the game already then it's worth a try!	----->	8
81016837	I've played all sorts of these types of games and I'm pleasantly surprised on how well the game is, great graphics, [I do have a beefy computer so, lol] I think the help section is lacking, but then the community has helped with that part.

81428122	For an Alpha this game is remarkably put together. Absolutely no problems playing this, the content is sufficient for an early access, and nothing less than I expected. Which is its only downfall, don't expect full release level content, its not really there. I find myself stating again more often than other games (say Banished for example). But I enjoy playing what is out and can not wait for more to be released. This is a gem in the making and would recommend regardless of sale or not.	----->	1

81448593	I really like the direction this game is going, I wish there was a bit more of the castle building aspect in the game IE: stone towers, gates, moats ect. Along with that maybe some more military units as well, Knights riding horses, ranged units, siege units (catapults, ect) ; a bit more interaction with the military mechanic would be nice.But other than that it's a fantastic game. very relaxing	----->	7

81495355	I've really enjoyed playing this game, and loved exploring the systems it provides.  It reminds me of the good old days playing Stronghold but with more lines of production to manage.  I'm really excited to see where it goes.The problem I've run into is in the later game food production lines tank even though I've been almost exclusively building food production.  I have a difficult time understanding what the supply vs demand is, and what the effect of building another production building provides.  I think including charts or more information would help alleviate this.  Also including information on the usage of transporters in the granary and warehouse would help me to identify where the bottlenecks in my production is.Despite the above problem, the game is beautiful, the villages grow in such an interesting way, and I enjoy starting over in new areas (which I typically do not).	----->	13

81532364	Although the game is still in early access and some late game features a are clearly unfinished or missing; It has a great foundation to build from. The organic way the towns and cities grow with the  help  of your guiding hand is very satisfying. The level of control the player has seems just right for the towns to seem genuinely alive and so for me personally it it just as much about building a city as watching it grow all on its own. Looking forward to future updates and highly recommend the game, even in its unfinished state!	----->	9

81573702	This is by far the greatest medieval civilization building game i've ever played. The mechanics are realistic, and just spot on. It's complicated, but not TOO complicated. I'm going to spend many many days playing this game.	----->	3
81574067	Better than any city builder I've played! I love how there is no grid, so much space for creativity.  I find keeping my funds up difficult unless I have added mods to increase fish/fruit etc.   Also I love all the mods so far would be great to see these ideas implemented into the game itself.   I can't wait to see more building types/player milestones added and story based gameplay.	----->	8

81649638	Wonderful little city builder, pretty easy to start off with but does get a few challenges as you unlock more resources and your citizens upgrade. I like the residential zoning feature that gives the villages that natural feel and also makes you feel like your city is organically growing. If you like city builders and like medieval era themes this game is a really perfect fit. It is still in alpha so there may be a few bugs but overall the game is playable and enjoyable.	----->	14

81722227	My kingdom for a sandbox mode! I have many, many play throughs that just end. I stop because things get frustrating from breaking down on a villager level and i can never figure out why people leave or no matter how many churches i put or food vendors, the needs are barely met. I'd love to just build a place and it work no matter how badly I do with each step. The building is fun. The odd micro manage the people and infrastructure needs either more explanation or a rework because it feels broken no matter how many ways I approach it.	----->	-7
81741531	This is a fun game to play both casually with friends and is skill based and makes it fun to get better at. This is a very fun game to speedrun as well! Enjoy! Worth the buy!	----->	14
81748204	Before I figured out what's what, I got really frustrated and didn't play it as much. I got curious and actually tried to figure the game out again (quarantine really is changing my behaviors).Total change of mind.Peaceful ambience, just set your villagers up and watch them succeed once you give them proper guidance. I feel lowkey productive even though it's just a video game which is really nice. Sure it's a wild time sink, even on 3x speed, but it's got a background feel to it. Like I'll just start it up, get myself to a good point, then wander around my room doing things pretending I'm also playing a video game. Makes doing chores easier tbh. I really hope they don't make it a game I have to pay attention to in the future. I really enjoy the laid back nature and lack of conflict currently. It's like if stardew valley was an rts.I've done a total one eighty on it, but you need to know a few things:1-Time sink. It takes hours to play, but you will notice progression frequently enough that you feel like you're accomplishing things.2-Sharp learning curve, not all information is available, obvious, or clearly communicated in-game (for example, more territory you buy=less cashflow because you pay taxes on your land. This is not clearly explained.)3-This is not the finished product, and there is a wall you'll hit eventually. Accept that from the beginning, and you're gtg.4-Let yourself be free from expectations of constant industry, and you'll enjoy this game a LOT more.	----->	8

82287567	TDLR;   I have had fun with this one thus far, the patches have added new resources and new monument type buildings such as Masterpieces, and the ability to orchestrate the bells of your church towers in regards to what Note they play and how often they ring. To me this game has been worth the $$.A Lovely idea a organic Sim City Builder IMO executed well, its organic in the sense that roads are formed where villagers choose to travel not where the player chooses to build them, however fear not you get to set zones to guide where your Villagers are allowed to go, they prefer traveling on roads however should a road not be traveled for a while nature will retake it this can be useful when the need arises to fix a section of road that is in the way of your vision first restrict the area wait till villagers from a detour road and the old road over grows then reset the zone. Housing is also a natural process where the player can set Residential zones but villagers choose where to build their homes within these zone. However these are only chosen if the villager needs can be full filled, their requirements in turn are based on their status. Status can be upgraded once a month as long as a great hall exists, each new class demands new things Serfs require basic housing 1 food item and access to church services higher levels require access to more complex goods. The Economy is tied into the needs system as food clothing and luxury items are sold through markets which generate your main source of income. A real nice addition is ability to build Custom Monuments via a modular building system. Monuments in game is a concept that is any more complex structure including Taverns, Military Keeps, Churches, and Lord Manor houses allowing the player to make anything from a humble Manor house to a Magnificent Manorial Complex. Keeping in mind the more complex the building the more resources your village must be able to provide.	----->	15

82353298	This game is almost meditative. I feel like this is how people who care about the stock market feel watching the numbers. I actually said that I was watching the numbers last night because I was staring at my village's happiness and watching for changes. It is in Alpha, so it takes some figuring out and I recommend always keeping an eye out for alerts because little things can glitch without too much visual in the village itself, but this has become my go-to zone out game for finals season.	----->	9
82356240	Lots of fun and a little frustration. A great game my husband and I like to play to unwind after a long day.	----->	9
82358085	The game is good and when VR compatibility came out I was hyped. Although there are a ton of bugs and performance issues in the VR mode that is to be expected for this is just the first update of many to come. There is one thing I believe would make it a lot better, that is to not force the player to use their left controller when in-game. I am not sure if this is just a Rift S issue and if it is that would make it a lot more understandable. Also the way the menus follow the player is a bit buggy and off, I am not sure if it is possible but I suggest keeping it in a locked location. Like the direction the user was facing when they pressed the button. On top of that, there are some maps (VR classic for example) that the menu can get hidden behind the rocks and background. So far the game is great and I really do still recommend it, good job!This review is old	----->	13

82753781	为Fidel写我的第一篇评测。评测时除了每日精通以外已经全成就，算是把这个游戏的大部分内容体验过了。如果要我以一个词来评价它我会选择【惊喜（surprise）】。当我第一次打开这个游戏时也没有想到看上去如此简单的小游戏能够包含这么多的内容。而从我第一次开局到第一次完成新手教程到第一次通关到现在都时常有发现它其中含有“哦原来我可以这样”的surprise。在游戏中制造这样的惊喜不是那么容易的事——首先要玩家了解最基本的机制，从而知道“我不能怎么做”，然后知道“我应该怎么做”，最后才会启发玩家“我是不是可以试试这样”。打个不怎么恰当的比方，就好像“讲一练二考三”的课程教学，游戏直接告诉玩家的只是简单的规则，而玩家实际获得的大部分知识都是通过摸索和实践得来的。一般来说玩家在一周目很难完全理解这些，因此需要一定的重复体验和经验积累，而这个略显枯燥的反复过程被游戏的rouge性质完美地化解了。即使并不了解那些彩蛋，随机性带来的新奇感也会促使玩家去一遍遍地通关（至少对我是这样的）。抛开游戏本身已经被讨论了很多的创意性（敌人和小狗的feature，一笔画和回溯，死亡机制带来的天生速通玩法和道具的使用，小狗可以汪汪叫等），这样的设计和内容安排也足以让它成为一款可能比看上去还要优秀解迷游戏。[spoiler] 游戏自带OST，音乐文件名有惊喜[/spoiler]	----->	0

82848635	This game is all around a great city builder. Graphics are extremely smooth, game play continues to improve and has been stable since I originally purchased, and the path/goal is easily identified and fun to work towards. Overall, it's a great time sink that you can spend hours on having fun.Specific positives:You dictate how everything looks. Want your rustic church to be spartan and simplistic? Make it so. Want it to be tiered with different court yards that flow into the village sprouting up around it? Make it happen. The customization to the bigger structures is pretty awesome and can lead to a lot of different combinations.The citizens, while extremely picky and slow to catch up to even their own desires that they can fulfill, are truly a fun thing to watch. Unlike most city builders, the citizens of this one dictate how things grow from their standpoint. They carve the paths that make the most sense to them. You can place buildings to try and manipulate those paths, but they pick and choose. Same with their housing, they pick where they want to erect their domiciles. Which is the one complaint I have about that system: I'll carve out a giant area for them to build homes, but they will not plop a new one for them until they're so upset they're ready to leave. It's rather infuriating.Cons - Nothing really. It's a alpha game, so IMO it's very well done and more than playable today.	----->	22

82879118	Great game, Notes i'd like to share. PROS:really relaxing. A ton of featuresgreat guide CONS:Sounds of woodcutting and such are pretty loud. You are not able to move buildings after you build them. In the start thats a pretty big deal because you play on a small part of the map (one sector)	----->	5

83109898	Having fell in love with this concept on sight, I bought this game almost three years ago. Since then, it has become my main hobby and connected me with an amazing community, from which I have gained a lot of people I consider close friends. As my steam indicates, I've got one or two or 10,000 hours in this game. Even if you completely ignore the community (Which you absolutely should NOT!), SpyParty is an incredibly deep and interesting game that I still find myself learning about to this day. The crux of most reviews here on steam come down to this; the idea that SpyParty is not worth 25$. And maybe they're right, if what you're looking for is a goofy party game to play with your friend. It functions well as that sort of game, but you'll be dropping 50$ on two accounts to do that. And for most people, that isn't worth it. But if you're really interested in the concept and the game itself? 25$ is a steal. This game is by far the best purchase I've ever made; not just the best game purchase. If you're like me, and the concept has drawn your attention, I'd urge you to try it out.	----->	24
83123791	2023 UPDATE: 3 years worth of wait was definitely worth it. What a beautiful and relaxing city builder with good amount of content :)Original Review in 2020:Promising, but unfortunately very little to do in the game. You have seen it all in few hours. Perhaps later with updates worth the price, so I am not refunding, but supporting progress to that.	----->	15
83125963	A really solid city-builder with lots of potential for further development! I'd probably wait for a sale though since I don't personally feel like the amount of content currently can justify the pricetag.	----->	4

83150392	I just spent almost all of the past 2 days playing Foundation. The first day, I kept making mistakes and starting the game over.

I think I'll be playing this one for a while longer than I expected.	----->	3

83520356	It is very interesting to build my own village.  I would hope for improvements on gems mining.  Gems are needed for a king statue and for the last masterpiece: an encrusted cross.  I am also puzzled with the appetites of my villages.  They consume so much usually.  However, one of my missions has a huge overproduction.  I keep building granaries and wearhouses, and there is never enough to store everything.  I would also hope on a major improvement in trade so that the neighbors would buy everything and in bigger volumes.  Also, the treasury capacity is somewhat limited.  I have more than 51K coins, and keep building towers as they store more money.  It would help if the capacity of each treasury unit was increased significantly.   Additionally, it is not clear what to do with all the gold that I am mining and the gold bars that the gold smelter is making.  I would make jewlry.  However, the production is limited by the impossibility to extract more gems.  My baailief found some mineral resources, but does not say which.  It would be helpful if I had pure gems in one of my games.  In general, the game is great!  There is a room for improvement.	----->	12

83663913	Having played for only Eleven Hours, i find i'm enjoying the game but it's too soon to tell if there are any nasty surprises as you get deeper into the game.  it's a cross between the early Settlers Games [except it's not riddled with bugs and doesn't seem to be a platform type game] and between  Civ-City4 [Sim-City4?] but with a medieval setting.  There's a bit of a learning curve as in all games but the help files are quite good.  i've yet to find out about replayability but you do get a small variety of location settings which bodes well, and i have yet to try the on-line & modding community to see what player improvements have been tried.  Anyway so far so good without having to petition the Developers for any problems which is as it should be but rarely achieved especially the Big Name publishers.	----->	2

I spend large amounts of my time designing and building churches and the lords manor, I just started building my first keep and I can tell you it is a ton of fun. The game itself does not appear to be challenging, it becomes easy after the first hour to meet your villagers needs and attract many others, I currently have over 80 people and I'd say I'm about 75% done all the buildings. The biggest thing I am craving but haven't run into yet is enemies. No random animal attacks, bandits, foreign invaders or any such diversion as of yet. Admittedly I only have 6 hours of play, hopefully once my keep is built enemies will appear.Anyway a game I will spend time with, good job game makers!	----->	9

I'll be eager to change  this to a positive review if the game becomes priced more fairly.	----->	12

83866900	Nice UI even if it's in early access. The idea of the game is to let the town organically grow with the player's decision-making regulating rather than micro-managing. That idea is really fun to explore and this game does splendidly ^^	----->	4

83924886	SpyParty is not a PvP, or at least in the way you'd expect if you play online games a lot. Yes, you play online against other human beings, but there's no tangible reward you accumulate for playing; no points, no cosmetics, no game passes, or ranks even. You also can't just log in and queue up into a random game immediately, as there isn't an auto-matchmaking system yet, so you need to seek out other online people in a lobby and challenge them to play, like an old-school online strategy game server.The closest game I can compare SpyParty to is Chess. Your reward for playing is that you get to enjoy a deeply strategic and psychological experience with your opponent. Or maybe the reward is that you get to become a better player and develop a more masterful play style alongside a great community of people also looking to grow. Or if you want, your goal can be to work up to tournament play and win competitive matches (there's a SpyParty Discord Server with occasional tournaments). Watching commentated matches on Twitch is surprisingly enjoyable.Like Chess, the game is so deep that it will feel really imbalanced if you play against someone much more or much less experienced than you. There are ways to handicap either player, but it works best if you find someone to play with that's at a similar level, so you can grow your skillset together. This is the main downside to the game. However, when you're in the lobby looking for people to play with, you can see how many games they've won, and challenge someone with a similar number as you, which is a pretty decent indicator for skill level in my experience. And if you like to ask questions or play against more seasoned players as a learning experience, the Discord server has many generous and kind folks to help out.If you just appreciate the silly concept of pretending to be a spy at a party, and want to see what that's like, that's also a totally legit reason to play, though the $25 may not be as justifiable.In any case, Happy SpyPartying!	----->	22

83972664	It's a really relaxing game. It's a lot like Anno but on a smaller scale, much smaller scale. Beautiful artwork and graphics. Simple mechanics, but they will keep you engaged. I don't know if this is still work in progress, but the one thing the game significantly lacks is the absence of any real challenge. Also, there is absolutely no way to intereact with other NPCs, or players in the network, which could have had made trade interesting. A huge shout out to the ambiance sounds. It's one of the best and most realistic.In short, the scope of the game is really really small. But if you just want to sit back, listening to birds chirping or a storm passing, over your tiny city, before heading out in search of the next resource and plans on how to utilize those resources to make your citizens happy, you could give it a shot.	----->	6

I did play a few practice towns to get a hang of it, then moved onto a real play though. I spent most of my time playing on just one city. With that, after about 80 hrs I was able to complete all the achievements and build to a point where there was no point in continuing. I've tried some Mods, and most are really cool, so i'm going to play with some of those to bring some new life into the game. There's some really cool stuff out there if you like to take the time to actually design a city. Only thing I have against this game is that the AI pathing can be a bit wonky. For example, if someone is feeling thirsty, sometimes they don't go to the nearest water source, and instead insist on going to one much further away. It can be the same with food, or other services as well. UI could also be improved, its not super user friendly and looks a bit dated. Lastly, this game could use a ground leveling tool. Building on hills or in depressions can clip work areas and entrances into the ground, and sometimes the AI gets stuck. It also just doesn't look good. Overall however, I do like this game and would recommend it - especially if its on sale. I hope to see continued development and new features, maps and buildings. 7/10	----->	18
84024365	Fantastic game so far, love the art style and organic growth, it's so satisfying when production chains link up perfectly for a particular goal. I was monitoring this game for a while before buying it and it seems the developers are going to put a lot of time and effort into this game in the future.	----->	6

84036700	Great game that gives you all of the things you could possibly love about the city builder genre. Even though it is still in alpha, it feels like a rather complete game. I have been having a few random crashes with my larger cities, but nothing that is causing major grief. I look very much to the full release and whatever else they have in the pipeline.	----->	5

84096291	I have had my eye on this game for a couple months. Due to early access I was a little wary but recent patch notes made it sound like a lot of improvements had been made so I picked it up with some christmas money and man has it been worth it! It doesn't hold your hand and you learn by doing. I am on my third village and feel like I really have the hang of the beginning. I am so glad I finally picked it up. Also the people on the discord are really helpful if you are stuck or have a bug!	----->	7

84105875	Very nice game with great potential. Although there are some issues like really bad UI or some kind of system that will help you see and fulfil needs of you citizens.  Maybe more events would be nice.. But the biggest disappointment for me is that currently there is NO OPTION TO CLEAR TREES!!! DEVS REALLY ?? Such a simple tool, yet there is none, instead you have to build multiple buildings and then destroy them in order to clear trees... Not very esthetic or common to have farm in Middle of forest? Apart from that I think game is incredibly good and for sure I don't regret buying it. Also hope Devs will release map editor.	----->	8
84119318	Lovely little 'city manager'/survival/resource management game. I went away and came back months later and they've improved and increased the depth of playability substantially.	----->	3
84124175	This game has seen me through a tough divorce. I divorced from my husband Shay around 11 months ago and I have found this game to be a great therapy tool to allow me to explore myself and my needs. This game has allowed me to see the depths of Mr. Cabyo's masterpieces and delve within the depths of Negerbollar's incredible story driven adventure. I would love for my children to one day play this game and share the experience I have had since my purchase. Yours sincerely, Tim Cunningham.	----->	12

84255164	I've currently got 75 hours into this game as of making this review, although that number will for sure go up with time.I've played a lot of these city builder kinda games, a number of which have been in early access and a couple have been abandoned. Its a risk you take with ANY early access game (DayZ anyone?) but so far polymorph games have been fairly regular with updates and most important, regular with communication with the community.Devs, if you read this. The most important thing you can do to prevent your early access game from dying. COMMUNICATION. Let us know what you're working on, let us beta test stuff and give feedback. We are here to be your QA team. USE US!!!!!Onto the review. The game is still a work in progress, but in my opinion has one of the best base systems to improve and tweak on. I love the art style of the game, the way the building system works is probably my favorite design yet Gridless and quick. Buildings are modular with different parts that serve different functions. Allowing you to choose between a small church or a massive cathedral. A cozy town or sprawling trade empire. The weak points of this game for me are the UI and the current tech tree path. The resource/trading system in the game has one very distinct path you must follow (largely based around access to tools) and beyond that first hurdle it no longer becomes a concern. Different starting cultures (with different building styles?) and access to different resources and trade routes could vastly increase replay-ability.The AI and how they manage resources could also use a second look. The cap on how much resources a warehouse/granary can hold is a problem late game, leading to a big city crowded with storage buildings and AI struggling to organize them all.So far I've loved my time with Foundation and I'm very excited to see how it progresses.	----->	10

84265584	I didn't bother with this game when it came out over a year ago, because there wasn't that much to do back then.  But, at long last this has turned into a really inventive and immersive city building game.  Just started playing and learning how to play, which the tutorial isn't all that informative!  You will need to watch a YouTube video to figure out many of the trading and keep management etc.  The game does a bad if not at all job of explaining how things work.  But, once you have those things figured out, its very smooth and fun.  I highly recommend this game even in its current state.	----->	-3

84616688	Although this game is in early access, it is an amazing game already. I did not realize how much I needed a medieval city builder. The customization of key buildings and monuments and when you balance your villagers and supply chains, is a very rewarding experience. You also get to see and manage the natural growth of your village into a believable town that would look natural in almost any RPG game like Skyrim, Fable, or the Witcher (there are probably better examples but I am a potato). Anyway, I think the last medieval city builder I played was Stronghold and it is very refreshing to return to the genre with this game.	----->	14

Once you get all the basics down it's just fun watching your village go from nothing into a giant city. Tons of fun for me and download some mods to help out with mainly storage.  I definitely recommend you give this game a try if you're on the fence about it.	----->	19

84655920	Less popular than the extremely similar Golf With Your Friends, I can say I have genuinely gotten way more enjoyment out of this than I thought I would. Playing through all the different workshop maps is super fun and I think it's a lot easier to just dick around in than in golf with your friends. The jumping mechanic is way better in this game and the options allow for different types of clubs which leads to many a shenanigan. Honestly I wish they added the feature of different ball shapes like in Golf with Your Friends but honestly it's still a super fun game to dick around in, especially for how cheap it is!	----->	15

84684586	Whether you want something relaxing to play on your own, or you have a whole bunch of friends it's such a blast to play. The community is vibrant, and exceptionally creative, giving you endless maps to play on. If you enjoy customizations, you can fill your boots with the number of skins, trails, and hats you can equip. No need to worry about pay-to-win on this game: you earn items as you go, but purely cosmetic. It's golf, and I have almost 85 hours playing it when I could be playing some AAA game: that should tell you how amazing this is.	----->	4

84793405	Am enjoying the build up of an environment for its own sake. The upcoming road map looks it will bring some interesting new features. I think this reminds me most of Settlers back when it (Settlers) used to be playable. Looking forward to the expansion of the production chains which manage to be interesting and engaging in this, whereas I find in say Anno 1800 it feels more like a job.So still enjoying playing Foundation and would recommend it if you enjoy playing the sort of games I have referenced above.	----->	14

84806543	I'm enjoying this game a lot. The expansion of my territory is going well, and I get to discover mineral deposits and manage trade and send soldiers on missions and get rewards. Villagers build their own houses in very haphazard, naturalistic configurations.One critique (and this may change in future development): I can see why people are unhappy, but NOT where. When my village is a city of 700 people spread all over the map, I need to know WHERE 150 people are not getting enough food, so I can put a market there or something.	----->	2

84875903	this game is a 10/10.so why the poor review?the game is a competitive game, not a casual game. for some reason though, the game starts you out with a tutorial that leaves out the action tests and all the complexity and magic in the game, in an attempt to make it more approachable. unfortunately, this is a completely spectacular failure. so the casuals play it, and theres just really nothing special there for them. then, the tryhards have to figure out for themselves that there is a secret complex fun mode to the game with the action tests, or somebody else tells them. with the 25$ price tag (which is justified by the quality and depth of the game), this is why the community for the game is so small. no one knows.so even if you do get passed that hump, there's 2 more major pitfalls. 1, there is no matchmaking. It's just a lobby and you have to invite people to play against you, usually it's just empty anyway. so good luck getting a game.then the biggest problem is that the whole community just loves to rope for god knows why. it's so unbearable. the players who will play you in the game will want to play you in a round, and then watch an entire replay of the whole round to analyze it before playing the next round. they'll even do it in tournament, which is just preposterous. In no other competition in the entire world is it normal for the competitors to sit and watch a replay of the round they just played before continuing to the next round. it's just bizarre, and what's the justification for it, that the game is complex?? Just imagine if a chess professional asked his opponent to wait in tournament, while he goes back and analyzes the match they just played before starting the next.this is a really sad review, because the game itself is actually a 10/10. but its a competitive game and it's really not for casuals, but for some reason the dev is intent on selling the game to casuals. in reality the game just ends up shoving away all the casuals and then most people who would tryhard the game don't even get to find out that it's a complex game because the dev just wants to cater to casuals, for some reason. i swear the dev for this game literally doesn't want to make money or something, it's like a passion project or something. if you are a competitive player and like complex games, and don't mind having your face roped off, this is the game for you. I'm absolutely still gonna tune into the streams of the tournament matches, because when you are watching instead of playing they skip ahead and you aren't getting roped. The production quality is amazing for such a small community and the level of play at the top is really spectacular. i highly recommend tuning into spypartyfans, look it up on youtube or twitch. it's sad, because this game could be so much more popular than it is, but there are systems in place to prevent that from happening.	----->	22

The developers have put a lot of work in and it shows. The game lacks in map's, a simple lake on the hills map would make it more fun to play. buying land is to easy. Just a Slight increase for each buy would do wonders to make the game harder. Lets get some night and day and other Seasons in there too. I hope for raiders, maybe Vikings.. That would be fun. The game is worth the money and i will be sending copies to all my friends. Have fun player One! And remember, it's just a game.	----->	17

There are some quality of life improvements (like management windows remembering where they were placed when I reload a save) that would have made life a little easier but the core gameplay loop is challenging enough to be satisfying. If you enjoy games like Banished you will definitely get along with this game. I'm looking forward to seeing what they do as it progresses of out early access, after 80 hours I feel like I have seen everything it has to offer at this point.	----->	6

85469199	There are still some improvements to the game, but I've played it long enough to realize that it's a good city builder. It has some unique aspects that I enjoy, such as the more organic looking residences that are built, along with roads that are formed based upon where people travel (as opposed to the player building the roads). This is a slow game - you can't just spam huge housing areas and lots of industries all at once. I see this as a benefit which increases the play time and enjoyment.The bad...The UI could use some work, but the developers have indicated that they will be working on that soon. Also, if you dont have enough goods that people desire, such as food or clothing, you can enter a very slow death spiral where people leave the village, and after vacating you have fewer people working those industries to supply those goods and few people in the markets to sell those goods, which means more people leaving the village, etc.	----->	1

85549043	This is a great game with very good balancing. The visuals are very pleasant and the controls are clear and good. The problem is that the end-game is very fast to reach so some more content would be nice. Possibly more professions or a more complex trading system. Something to make filling the map with buildings more rewarding.	----->	9

85918687	Alright, lets break it down!The Good:1. This game is an enjoyable medieval city builder. If you're into city builders, you'll likely enjoy this and feel at home watching your little minions run around.2. Devs seem to care and release regular updates for their early access game, have no problem putting money into a fun game being made better!3. Progression system that feels difficult but not impossible to run through. It's mainly based on population and population type which will unlock additional buildings and production.The meh:1. The UI makes me feel I'm using microsoft paint with one arm while riding a tricycle...not a fan2. Population progression is largely based on individual villager needs - which can be a pain in the butt to actually identify. TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT TORRENCE.3. Gold is easy to either make a lot of or end up like my gamestock shares...be carefulAll in all, I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys sims or citybuilders. If that's not your type of game, I'd watch a few youtube videos and then decide. Keep up the good work devs!	----->	12

85923783	Very nice game by the look, only a few hours into it, but it looks like a great little thing.  Few rough edges but bug-free, cute and entertaining. Great addition to the city builder genre.Edit; I was a bit hasty wih the bug-free-ness, though.  It is crashing now, quite often.	----->	10
85924237	Banished meets Settlers, if that sounds good to you give this game a go and build up a wonderful kingdom! Excited to see improved UI and more content, so far its in wonderful shape though. This could be the next big city builder type of game.I love city builder games like Settlers, Anno and Sim City and this is more of the relaxing chill gameplay that I love from those games.It is fun to play and the gameplay is very well done. The UI and graphics can be improved, but the basic stuff is here and already very enjoyable and well on it's way. It is a challenging game!This is the most fun I have had on a city builder/resource type game in awhile!	----->	30
85928159	I had this game on my wishlist for a while not really sure if it was worth it. I finally purchased the game on a whim, fully expecting only a few hours of fun cute simple puzzle gameplay which was totally fine by me. What I got was so much more; I absolutely ADORE this game. The visual art style, the music and sound effects, the simple but tug-at-your-heartstrings cute story!! It all FAR exceeded my expectations. The variety of enemies and mechanics, the seamless controls, the additional playable characters, daily new puzzle, and the many easter eggs make this game not only have insane replay value but be so insanely addictive too!! If you are looking for a fresh puzzle game and are loving the art style, definitely do not hesitate like I initially did. It is absolutely worth the $10. And never forget to bark. Ever!	----->	12

85941952	Really like it, it takes time to get into it, but its nice. I like to compare it with the settlers, but it has other focuses. The city building aspect is really nice. This game isnt about defending your village or sendingt troops to war, its about creating your own little medival city, which can fulfill all the needs of its villagers. The decoration of your city can take hours of time and you allways will find a place in your village to built something new, especially with mods. Would recommend it for everyone who likes games like AoE, Settlers, or Anno.	----->	12
85945260	Even in this early access state (alpha atm) it's quite enjoyable to play this game, but as many early access games it has some downsides.Trading is not intuitive, you never sell how much you select (higher than a value you want to keep), the vendors sometimes don't buy at all the goods. To see what you sold and in what quantity you have to visit the budges tab. If the traveling vendors don't want to buy everything you have in stock then there should be a section in the trading UI to show the lowest and highest amount a trader is interested in buying. I could never make the traveling vendors buy plank or clothes for the love of anything holy.Some of the emissaries and monk quests are bugged. Being in a hills map they keep asking for fish. Only way to get is to buy if someone is selling since you can't fish them out of the ground with ponds/running water missing in such a map. Sometimes when i had enough berries/bread i couldn't complete the quest since it wasn't in stockpile. I tried to stop the transporters from selling the items from granaries but they didn't listen. Apparently the buttons there don't work properly. The villagers wanting a certain thing and losing crazy amounts of happiness trying to figure what sector needs what. The biggest problem was churches. Had to build two really close to each other since some of my villagers were too lazy to walk to the other and i even put more space in that still didn't resolve the problem until i made a new one. At some points in my playthrough i had enough food but villagers were crying about food. I presume i had to make more markets across the regions (still don't know since it didn't quite resolve the problem). More information about this could be useful in the UI telling players that they need more production or more shops.The military missions were a nice touch especially when the mission is a success awarding you with money and some giving you items(tools, stone, etc.), but they are a bit basic for my taste.There are too few iron mining sections on the map ( only played hills 2 times, had 3 marble deposits like i needed that much  ) to keep a nice flow of the production line.Warehouses only store up to 100 items per slot. That's kinda low imo.Even if this game never comes out of early access i consider there is enough content to have fun with for the price tag.	----->	15

85971147	I really enjoy the freeform nature of placing the buildings were you want and the town forms naturally around our choices.  There are some non-intuitive aspects of the game like I cannot figure out how to promote newcoers to serfs and the quest doesn't really explain it.  The help is superbasic as it doesn't describe every thing in the game.  But I definitely am going to promote this game to others as it is really enjoyable.	----->	9
85971692	It is a hard game to master and learn, but it is insanely addicting.Might take you 2-3 game to get it right, but once you got the right setup and your map has all the minerals you need, you'll be able to make the medieval town of your dream. What is special with Foundation is the ability to create custom buildings and castle, no worry about building houses, the villagers do it themselves.That said be carefull, all the npc are millenials and will cry that they have no house if you don't let them build close enough from their work location and I`m dead serious, you have to let them build near the workplace, less than 70m	----->	-8
85977321	I have actually played this game for around 20 hours. This review is being written by someone who plays this game through family sharing, which apparently prevents you from writing a review unless you own the game on your account.It is very similar Banished but instead of managing health and preventing starvation, you manage needs and happiness. Population growth is only from immigration, which only happens if your current population is happy enough. There are many cool mechanics that aren't present in Banished, such as promoting villagers from Serfs to Commoners to Citizens and others. The middle ages theme is great. One large source of immersion in the game is an economic system with money, which was missing in Banished. The gridless construction and automatically constructed roads is awesome. The game is very fun with diverse gameplay mechanics!	----->	7

86025949	I just bought this game about 2 or so days ago, It's been sitting in my wishlist for a while. Saw it was on sale, decided to give it a shot. I fell in love within 15 minutes, and i've been chronically bored of all of my games since the start of last year. That says a lot for my picky self! The gridless expansion is amazing, i usually love a clean boxy city but i'm loving the random placement, and yes it has a few bugs but they haven't been game breaking thus far, just silly and easily fixable by a restart or menu click to get rid of a prompt. And lucky me i joined in on the fandom when they have recently released talk of endgame stuff and adding several fantastic mechanics! Graveyards, families, children, a reason for the military other that to help others, etc. So YES i recommend it because it's a wonderful game, clearly loved, and they are about to add some of the biggest improvements thus far, which i'm basing off the recent roadmap they released. <3	----->	24

86039016	omgod so beautiful.  elegant music with gorgeous nature sounds.  Depth of field effect is spectacular.  I actually love love the UI being windowed, with tiny access tabs... allows me to keep applicable windows open full time.Management is available from service-needs end or from service-available end - that is there are multiple methods to connect villagers with needed or available work.  They make their own housing is great, as is the automatic roadmaking, and best of all NO GRIDS!!  My village is growing the way it would - organically, and beautifully.The people walk thru buildings, but around individual trees.  They pick up and put down crates, which then are removed from or added to what's there... There is huge love that's gone into this title and I am in love with the result.  All I can say negative is that the tutorial could be... nah, it's been lovely as soon as I relaxed into the groove of it.  They'll tell me what's next when I get there.  For now, let them people work and just enjoy the (always perfect - could fix that) weather.It's like if Banished and Stonehearth had a baby that was going to be better than either.  Here's hoping the development continues, cuz this one could be top of the heap.	----->	35

86104168	Still in early development.The game will allow you to start your city in areas that are inaccessible to newcomers (little islands between rivers without a bridge to the other side). Yet, the game doesn't give you free choice of where to start. You have to choose from pre-selected options.Some mechanics make the game more difficult without necessity - strange money cap, which happens to be the amount necessary to buy new land, so you have to click over and over until you purchase successfully; characters saying they can't find berries/stone, presumably due to over farming, but you can still clearly see the berries and stone; the introduction to controls is all at the beginning, rather than as the game is going, so if you don't read the instructions, there's no tutorial - you'll end up having to google a lot of things, like how to mine from the mountainside, which requires that you inspect it first using a character from your royal manor.After you play for an extended time and have a larger city, it becomes complicated to manage all the characters and jobs. The bottom left lets you see a list of your buildings, so you can see where there's an opening. You also can see a list of characters to assign jobs. None of the characters will automatically fill a vacant roll. When you're really into the game, you tend to forget to check if characters joined you, then they get mad about not having a job, and it tanks your happiness.Even still, it's a very addictive game. It's a fun, new city builder, that gives me some memories of Pharaoh/Cleopatra. I look forward to the changes that they make in the final version. In the meantime, mods sound appealing. Definitely worth the $$ for city building enthusiasts.	----->	0

86146084	Alright folks, do consider this to be a first impressions review. I've only owned this game for a few days and have only put several hours into it.I usually don't buy Early Access games. This is my first one actually. They have a legacy of being unfinished products, filled with bugs and feeling what they are: unfinished. Truth be told, I haven't encountered any of these issues yet. Sure I've only played several hours, but there are finished games with bugs within the first few hours of playing.Now, why did I buy this game? Surely I broke my own rule. I didn't read any reviews or watch Youtube playthrough. What struck me was the looks of the game. It looks a lot like Settlers VI or even Knights and Merchants, a game a played for hours and hours when I was a kid.My first impressions, what do I like and what do I dislike?+ To start, I love the game speed. This feels like one of those games I played years ago. Where nothing can happen for minutes of game time and you can forget to pause, come back from making coffee and your town isn't burned down yet. The village will manage itself, but it might just take several minutes for some buildings to be build, so why not get some coffee or snacks in the meantime anyway? In this way this game reminds me of Anno 1602 or Knights & Merchants, where you'd have to wait for the villagers to gather the stone from the stonemason, before you'd be able to complete a certain building. If that's not your thing and you easely get annoyed by the builder taking a food break instead of finishing that farm, I would advice you to look a little further.+ Graphics and gameplay is great. Feels somewhat like the original Black & White and above mentioned Knights & Merchants. Your town grows organically and your villagers feel to have minds of their own. There's no grid, you can place and rotate however you like. Villagers will find their way and their steps carve out a road in the landscape. Sure, pathfinding can sometimes do with some tweaking - I'm not into straight lines in medieval landscapes - but remember, this is an alpha.+ UI reminds of the old days. I've understood they're working on a new UI, but I like the current one in looks and feel. Reminds me of Rollercoaster Tycoon actually. It's not on of those UI's where they've hidden all menus behind right clicks and you easely close it by clicking the wrong mouse button.- Now, the UI also has some issues. Villager happiness and resource management is important, but I struggle to find out how my villagers are doing. I have to click each of them to see whether they are happy or not. I haven't found a way to see overall happiness of my serfs or commoners. With such knowledge you'd know what's lacking and what I should invest in. Same thing for resources and stockpiles. If my cloth is low I struggle to find whether that's due to me not having enough sheep, sheep farms or farmers or whether it's due to the weaver underperforming.- Quests and missions are one of those game mechanics that certainly feel unpolished. I didn't really bother with them. Yes they are useful and can give you good rewards, but often it was easier to skip them and safe the food I had to send to the king.Now, this is still an unfinished game and it could still do with a lot of improvement. Personally I'd love to see the villages you trade with as small villages in the corners of the map, instead of off the map. It would just add some flavour to the game.Should you buy this game? Probably? Are you into old-fashioned games like Settlers, Anno, Black & White, Knights & Merchants? In that case: yes, give this game a go. Do you prefer fast paced games, flashy graphics and animations? You might want to look a little further.	----->	23
86149831	Works pretty good for being Early Access.I don't think there's any way to win at the moment (?), but the challenge is fair enough.It's very much in the lane of Settlers and Anno, but somehow I prefer the villager management in this game rather than Anno. Maybe because attracting new villagers feels more specific and rewarding here. Every villager counts, so you want to make them happy.Right now I think the biggest game challenge is to figure out why the production lines get ineffective when the town grows. I noticed the villagers are walking off from work to the markets and church, so I think it's important to have these things close to where every villagers work and live. Not just have a market and a church, but to make sure the nearby shops actually have surplus goods, and the church must have spare seating. If not, the villagers will either gather up, wait and give up, or they will spend extra time walking to the next alternative.A good feature would be an overview of where each villager tends to walk, which areas tend to crop up with people, and which stores\churches are often unable to meet demands.	----->	16

WIth some work we have the next big city builder.One thing I would love in the final game is an option to quickly view a timelaps of your village, similar to how EU4  does it so you can quickly bask in the glory of your leadership.	----->	8

86214270	Recommended for NOW since it's an EA game, but it wouldn't be enough for a full game. You can expect at least 30 hours of gameplay (I also played on another account.)Things I like;+It's really a calm game with nice music. +Natural town with auto-created roads and homes.+Unique atmosphere with sweet graphics and cool UI.+Modular builds for some structures allow freedom for creation. Things I hate;-I really hate distance. Villagers don't work 250m away from home. The villagers don't go to a market or a well that's 250m away. Because of this, it's impossible to create a town center. Everything has to be expanded wide and separately.Come on! You're living in a small village. What do you expect? -Hexagon expansion doesn't make sense for a game like this. -Lack of control. *Although I like auto-created roads, in some situations its looks simple ugly. There are ways to manipulate roads with zones and walls but it's not effective. We should be able to draw roads. *Some villagers will take a long route and lose a lot of time. So I can't maximize efficiency.*Crazy sheeps and cows goes wherever they want inside the building's circle.-Lack of information. *On events like villagers leaving town, I don't know who and why is leaving. *No information for the production chain. I can't see bottlenecks or surplus. *Warning messages don't provide any solution and they don't make sense at all. *Villager needs. When it says there is a villager who doesn't have access to food, water, etc. again I can't see who, where, and why...Things I don't expect but could be better;*Life cycle, disasters, more weather conditions, randomly created maps, editing maps(fixing the ground), more buildings, more building attachments,  more neighbor cities, more quests...	----->	16

86349968	Game adds a lot of new mechanics to the genre and its refreshing. The organic city building works quite well and every town will look unique. You guide it along but it shapes itself in a lot of ways. The current market system doesnt yet work quite right, but the future for this game is bright.	----->	0
86350684	I love the ideas behind this game! It is a lot like Banished, but is not restricted to a grid system. This game has a lot of potential, but as other reviewers have mentioned - resource management is extremely difficult. In its current state, one bad citizen promotion (which changes how much resources they consume) and your economy falls apart. If there was a way to see how these promotions would affect the economy before doing it then the problem would be solved. Another issue that I had was with painting zones - there is no easy way to see the effective range of your production buildings. It can be learned over time by playing the game, but it would be nice to have some sort of visualization.Overall, the graphics are charming, and the ability to customize buildings is a nice touch. I can't wait to see how this game evolves in the future.	----->	8

86435545	https://youtu.be/7C9_FpyIlFwFoundation is a city builder that combines elements from banished, and city skylines, two of my favourite, and arguably, the best city builders in the market.Curator Page:https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36307721/+Good ideas borrowed from cities skylines+Relaxing music+Easy to get into+Areas of opportunity can make for a lot of content-Tutorial is not easily laid out-Early Access related bugs-Still clearly a lot of development to be doneFoundation starts you off on a plot of land, similar to Cities Skylines does. After earning enough coin, the main currency of the game, you can expand by purchasing more land. It is crucial that more land is purchased for expansion in order to maximise profits and earn access to mineral deposits such as iron and gold.Residential areas for your citizens are also similar to CS where you determine a plot of land can be used for building houses using a brush. The citizens build houses as needed and also automatically upgrade the buildings depending on their class level.You earn gold by selling food and goods to your citizens but also by trading your resources with other factions. Trades like those happen automatically and are incredibly easy to set up. A little more expansion on the trades would be a good idea in order to make it a tiny bit more challenging and add some more logistics to it. There are missions you can take such as delivering a certain amount of goods to either the people, the king, or the clergy in order to receive more favour points from each faction. The more points you have, the more unique buildings you can unlock. That is however one of the two criteria that determine whether or not a building can be unlocked.The other criteria is the status of your citizens. Every beginning of the month, you are able to promote your citizen class to a higher grade. Each grade gets progressively more expensive to achieve, and costs more gold coin than the previous one. Buildings unlock by having more citizens with higher status. As your citizens' status increases, so will their needs too. It is important to keep your citizen's needs fulfilled in order to avoid them leaving your establishment. It is quite easy to keep their needs fulfilled however since there are really not that many needs to begin with. Think of Anno when you picture this mechanic if you have ever played that game.From there and on, the game is pretty self explanatory on how it works at its core. You gather resources, you build buildings to gather different resources and so forth. It is nice to see all these mechanics from the three giants squished into one game. I am not sure if the final product will represent this idea in a better way, but although this early access version of the game is quite rough around the edges, there is premise to be delivered here.	----->	27

86477408	Foundation is still early access, and it is fair to say there remain a few rough edges to smooth off - the road map shows the developers are aware of them.Nevertheless, these do not distract from an outstanding game. The mechanics did take a little while to pick up, but after a couple of run through I was progressing nicely. It hits the goldilocks zone of being a fun challenge to get me thinking, but satisfying that I do make progress.The way the paths develop and the villagers animation give an organic feel to the game which is the key to why Foundation stands out for me.Well worth a buy and I'm looking forward to enjoying the progress of the game	----->	14
86478309	This game is quite fun if you like city sims. I am very happy with how the developer has responded to problems that users have had. Not only have they fixed the issues quickly, but they even suggest temporary work arounds until the problems can be fixed. The new UI is stunning and very easy to understand, helping Foundation feel more immersive and more polished. This helps the game feel more finished and less like the users are playing an alpha version of an early access	----->	16

86564229	It's a fun game, starting out and building up is really compelling and can give a good bit of content. The atmosphere and art style is charming and very relaxing and nice to look at. When you start getting your village built up and all the paths are developed it looks very impressive and artistic. My major issue is that once you start getting up to a few hundred people and promoting to serfs, commoners, citizens, it seems the resource management gets a bit messy. I have yet to have a town with 300 people that doesn't need an absolutely absurd amount of food production and clothing production that it's more villagers than I even have needed to work. Because there is so much food and clothing required I can't move forward into many citizens because it's simply not possible to have enough workers to produce luxury as well. If they could rework the resource requirement or production rate so I don't need 100 gathering huts, 50 wheat farms/windmills/bakery, ect ect for a couple hundred villagers it would honestly feel more natural, because lets be real no village ever had more food production than people.At present I could easily say to get it if you are into city building type games, because while late game gets a bit fucked, starting new villages is easy and there are plenty of map regions and start zones.	----->	17

86620426	This game does something that other games of the ilk don't - and this 'thing' perfectly encapsulates the type of game it is: You place civic buildings, but your villagers create the roads and the paths. This means the way your settlement evolves feels organic and purposeful; you're not forcing villagers to do something they don't want to, if they see a quicker way. This feels more genuine, and is ultimately one of the reasons I keep coming back to it throughout it's early access period.	----->	4

86670287	Where I do enjoy this game for what it currently is, take my praise with a grain of salt.This game everything I could have hoped for in a city building sim. However, there is a game breaking bug where villagers get stuck and cannot move, leading to a cascade effect of villager happiness going on a fast decline, and people constantly leaving your village, essentially making the game unplayable. I hope the devs fix this soon, but other than that, a very fun, addicting and relaxing game.	----->	8

86758473	This game is very entertaining and a blast to play awhile with friends. However it's  entire point is to be a multiplayer game, but there is no way to even attempt to navigate the online options. The online display is clunky and complicated- it does discourage you from playing the online mode with other players. The game contains few bugs and is fairly easy to understand even with the lengthy tutorial. If you are looking for a game to play with your best friend this is the perfect game. Hope to see further updates of this game.	----->	8

86798383	For anyone that likes city builders this is really nice, and playable in alpha.But there are no combat, you just send soldiers out on quests.I have had no issues what so ever!The only things missing is making it easier to do certain tasks, like:Making it easier to not send wounded soldiers into battle.Knowing which granaries and warehouses are full of x resourceKnowing which workplaces are idle without checking them one by one to make everything more efficient.And i would really like it if they would make all the land you don't own not visible as this would make it more fun to expand, maybe add a scouting option, because late game you got all the main resources you want since you know exactly where to expand to to get it.But i'm really enjoying it and as an alpha its impressive as its fairly balanced for my playstyle.You should easily have 20 hours of playtime, as of this moment (15 hours) i just unlocked everything, but i'm far from knowing everything. (and missing achievements if that is your thing)	----->	10

86877757	Excellent city builder/ production chain management game with a lovely art style. Still in alpha so take everything with a pinch of salt, but shows great potential. Strongly recommend	----->	8
86882692	Through my years of gaming, I have played city builder after city builder. Started with civilization then sim city, even tropico and elvenar. I was always looking for a city builder that had a more in depth feel to it, and even had the challenge of building on different terrain. Well I am glad i read about this game when i stumbled upon  a article about a medieval city builder was like a sandbox. Foundation in a amazing game already and it still is in its infant years. You folks did a amazing job with this game and the roadmap for it just looks amazing. Keep up the amazing work folks. I plan to do builds on all terrain maps available and see what I can do with them!	----->	16
86892600	TLDR I am about 30 hours in and counting and so far enjoying this game. Struggling a bit to keep inventory full, no comprehensive menu for tracking inventory and storage. The game needs a better tutorial and I wish we had one more speed increase!I've been looking for a game that combined this kind of graphics and building ability (kind of like Sims) with the city building game play of Banished. This is it! Took me a minute to figure it out and get into it, the menus (symbols and fonts) are small and there isn't much of a tutorial so it has taken some trial and error. I restarted like four times before I finally built a town that I've been able to keep advancing with. It's not easy but it's fun! You have to sell resources to make money, but you can't expand to get access to more resources without money so... and the trading doesn't set you up, really. You can't buy bread from anyone until you can create bread... you can't buy clothes until your town CREATES clothes. Feel me? It took me a couple tries, let's just say.  I need a better tutorial on how trading works because I can't seem to stock pile enough food myself even though I have several wheat farms/windmills/bakeries, and gathering huts. Also why is there only one fisherman per dock? Would be nice to have two at least - one to fish and one to move inventory so I could actually start to stockpile some fish! It's quite repetitive in how you start a town and there are only a handful of maps but they're neat, I've started on all of them so far. I wish there was a better, more comprehensive way to track inventory. Currently there's a list of all resources but I don't know which resources I've stored in which warehouses without clicking on them ALL and bringing up a cumbersome and large menu for every..single..warehouse. And there's no way to rename them or distinguish them so I have to remember the order I built them or click on all of them and look individually. It also irks me that we can't assign available swords to all available military in one click - I have to assign all 100+ swords individually. Still, I continue playing and figuring it out and enjoying it. There's a lot going on and the menus are small for my old eyes. I looove the aspect of building custom churches, manors, and keeps. I like that the people build houses and trails organically though I wish I had control over deleting roads. So far I do recommend! *** I second the reviews calling for the little sims to include people of color! ***Please, that can't be an unreasonable request and will make it just soo much better for so many.	----->	30

86902942	Has a lot of potential. One quality of life thing that I would want more than anything is something like city skylines has when placing new churches/lumber camps/wells/etc where it will highlight all of the same type of building when you are deciding where to place one, and then will give you a quick idea of what area of your town is lacking in this industry.Lots of small quality of life things go a long way. One more thing would be a production line for a resources, starting from a lumber camp, with a line to the warehouse, and then branching lines to different industries.	----->	5

86904029	UI is very clumsy and needs major overhaul asap. Game is great in its core. Banished was my first game of this type and this is my second one in such genre and mode and this is miles ahead of banished already even though its in alpha. The UI is the only thing that needs a huge update as it is overwhelming at first and just clunky and hard to read.	----->	3

86982179	Fun little sim builder, easy to get lost in it, you cant just place items wherever you want, you actually have to put a little thought into how your're setting up your structures so that your people stay happy and that buildings near one another compliment one another that way your villagers are not walking more then they have to thereby slowing down your rate of progress. For being in its Alpha stage still, there are some text place holders in random spots, but the game runs smooth and i have had no crashes or issues with anything so far.	----->	0

86984710	Pretty solid city/village/kingdom builder. The no-grid layout lends to a more organic feeling of growth. Need to play with the key bindings to make things a little easier. Overall the game is very nice looking, runs smoothly and is fun to play. It will eat your time like any good game! I would like to see a co-op map in the future, building with or near another player could make things interesting.If you like city builders and world building than this is worth a go!	----->	21

86997977	Pretty great game - I love the organic way the city can grow.  I worry a little bit about replay-ability. I just got to mining gold and created that fountain, and I'm not really sure what I would do next. The graphics are kind of a a bummer too - my machine is old, but I can run many games at high res but low effects - I could never get above 20 fps here, even at low res, which made the game a little frustrating.So, great for alpha, and I hope to see more content and a better user experience for the full release!	----->	10

87132079	 Simply put, If you love Settlers, you will love Foundation. Music, ambient, cuteness of the characters, all the ingredients are present. If you don't know Settlers (you should!) it's medieval village construction and management. A kind of Simcity where you meet each of your citizens up close and personal. If you take good care of them, more will come to your village and you can grow, expand, unlock new resources, etc. Only the direct combat with neighbors is absent. If you realy like the military side of it in Settlers, you will perhaps miss it here. There's military in Foundation, but the troops are sent to fight far away for the king, we don't witness any fights, only local training and patrolling. Personally, I don't miss that part of the combat and I love it already as it is.	----->	11

87183606	It's a really fun game to just turn on some chill music and relax to. Sometimes the happiness meter is a pain to manage, but I guess that's the most realistic aspect about it.Highly recommended, honestly. I was introduced to it as an Age of Empires derivative, but it's really its own thing, a fun, aesthetically pleasing, feudal city builder.	----->	5
87183827	This game is a little tough to get used to, but it's challenging and fun. There's a lot that goes unexplained, or you have to find out for yourself. For example, I lost two villagers after promoting them to commoners because there wasn't anywhere with more desirable housing. There's definitely a learning curve with trying to balance your resource usage/storage and villagers' happiness. My wishes for this game: Make the painting tool variable sizes, so I can paint some tight corners for crop fields or residential zones. Also, please add some villagers that aren't just white. It's a video game, there's no reason all the characters need to be white.	----->	1

87202949	Really relaxing city builder at first, but it can quickly spiral out of control if you're not careful. The freeform approach to housing and pathing for the NPCs is really interesting. Just don't stare into the villagers' eyes for too long.....	----->	0

87241803	This game is the most peaceful and serene city builder I have played in recent memory. The sound track is amazing! The graphics are basic but beautiful and simple. Any one who has something bad to say about this game either shouldn't be playing city builders or they forgot that this game isn't a full release.	----->	4

87246776	Two years later I have come back to rewrite my original review. Many updates later and what clearly appears to be a passionate team of devs has really brought this game to life. Great work!I still think the tutorial is a bit lack luster but it's greatly improved since my original review. The information has cleaned up quite a bit too.8/10, would recommend this.I want to love this game, but there are glaring issues that leave me dissatisfied. In it's current state, I can not recommend this game to anyone but more seasoned city builders, and even then, you may find yourself frustrated by basics you are used to in other games.  Reasons why:1.) The tutorial is lack luster. A long read window you will have to refer back to constantly for the beginning portion of your game. I will say, at least it is there. It is a nice tool, but not a good replacement for a working playable tutorial. 2.) The information you are given is poor and hard to understand. Your citizens are unhappy. Why? Who knows.  All you are given are hard to decipher icons and bars. (Bars that fluctuate rapidly with no rhyme or reason.) Is that a food icon? Pretty hard to tell. I had to go find a wiki page to realize that. But I have plenty of cheese and bread! Turns out, serfs only eat berries? Only reason I figured that out was googling the problem. I shouldn't have to do as much googling as I have to play this game. My villagers won't make themselves houses. Why? Turns out, not enough space. Again, I had to find an obscure old forum post to learn that. Again, wasn't information readily available to me in the game. My commoners won't upgrade their houses. Why? Desirability apparently. Again, another thing I had to learn through google searching. The game should tell me this!3.) The ui is confusing. Why are there two separate buttons for territory that are the same icon, but perform different functions? And why is that not in the same menu? It's also littered with alpha game artifacts, two years after it's EA launch: https://i.imgur.com/JC6Phig.png4.) The automation of the game is cute in concept but functions poorly. I understand that part of the appeal of the game is to let your village grow organically, but you have absolutely no control over where your villagers plop down their housing. The road portion makes a ton of sense and I like that bit, but when it comes to your villagers housing, they throw it down kind of anywhere, taking up a ton of unnecessary space. I have a TON of dead space around my Lords Manor because of how willy-nilly my villagers dropped their houses: https://i.imgur.com/nYHHzXe.png  Personally, I like to build neat and tidy little villages and cities, but this is just a nightmare. Maybe out in the country side, you can throw up a cute little cabin how you see fit, but in the middle of your city center, you don't toss up your building up catty-cornered and kill a ton of space. Maybe make it so you can toggle this on or off. I will most likely continue to play and I genuinely wish to see this game grow and improve, but in it's current state I do not recommend it to other players.	----->	12

It makes it feel so much organic and engrossing! That said, the UI leaves a lot to be desired and the system for the villagers choosing their homes is occasionally deeply frustrating... But none of that puts any more than a small dent in a truly enjoyable experience!	----->	3

87326509	Compared to golf with friends, this game has a much more realistic way of hitting the ball, on some cases making it really fun. But, golf with friends has the better courses, more courses, and actually still gets regular updates + this online multiplayer isn't good unless you're playing with your friends, but if you wanna play a random online match with random people, golf it isn't the game. Golf with friends' multiplayer is miles better. If you can get both, I would recommend.  Golf with your friends often goes on sale for 5 bucks.	----->	5

87361205	Has Potential to be a great game, i love the fact villagers build their own houses and paths. also the manor/church builder is amazing. biggest let down is the ease of it so never really have low food, or lose people. will be 10 out of 10 when all updates are out. will hopefully give it the challenge of banished.	----->	9

87438920	This is like Settlers but without the annoying battles and bugs.Its early access so there are production links that end too quickly or don't have an obvious link and the system to manage population happiness needs some fine tuning to make it clear what is needed.But this is a great game, infinite customisation, great graphics, hours of fun. Spend those hours building a perfect city or try to expand quickly and max out the tech tree.Can't wait to see how this game develops.	----->	15

87453482	This is a super fun city builder and very challenging at high populations (300+) I find that the AI pathing could use some tweaking for efficiency, because something as simple as running out of clothes in a high population with a decent number of citizen status AI will send them all over the map and completely crash the economy.  So expansion has to be extremely carefully planned.  I had a city of 420 people that had the economy completely crash because of a clothing shortage.  My citizens in important roles, like creating flour or producing wheat, were instead running across the map.  So not only did I have a clothing problem, it soon spiraled into a food problem.  It can be fixed, simply by putting newcomers and serfs into new positions (as tailers, etc) and then when the situation resets you have an insane abundance.  Part of the fun is in the balance you create by insane micromanagement.  If that's not your vibe you might not enjoy this, but I find it extremely engaging and fun (though I would like to see some improvement in AI efficiency - for example, while across the map in search of clothing, why not also visit the church and market? Why fly all the way across the map in search of another church or market? and before you say my church was full - it wasn't!)	----->	19

87516053	I've only played the game in VR. Its good but needs work. Heres my feedback for the devs:Needs smooth locomotion for fine tuning your position. Teleport only is not okay in any modern vr game. Yeah it might be fine in a game like this if you have a large playspace, but if you're limited in space and you have to do a ton of micro-teleports just to get the right spot - its annoying.Needs smooth turn or at least an instant snap turn without the fade. Its way to slow and literally takes me 30 seconds to turn around. If you're going to add smooth turn make sure there is a speed adjustment. Slow smooth turns makes some people sick, there has to be a slider with lots of range.The winter map is unplayable because everything is unlit white. Way too bright, turn off the post processing please.Only my right hand is visible.TAA/FXAA do not look good in VR. Lack of proper MSAA means the game looks super blurry, even at 160% ss. Please consider making the VR build run on a forward renderer with anti aliasing options.With all this being said, I did have some fun and can see potential here as far as the VR side of things goes. The putting feels good and performance is not an issue. Looking forward to future updates that address some of these issues!Played on Index	----->	20

87571717	I’m having a good time. Interesting supply chain, and just when you think you’ve achieved equilibrium and think you’re ready for that next construction project everything ends up in the septic tank (do I try and dig myself out of this mess or just start over from the beginning). For me a good balance of achievement / frustration.This is Early Access so there are occasional bugs that may send you to the crash handler, but the game backs itself up often and I haven’t lost much of my labor. The pace of progress is great for relaxed planning and I’m enjoying the music, graphics, and lighting changes that occur when the weather turns sour.Bottom line, for me this was a solid entertainment purchase.	----->	11

87577234	This game is incredibly addictive.  While most of your work will happen on a high level view, you can slow it down, or pause it, and zoom in and enjoy the little details of the buildings you design.  The whole thing is dynamic, so can tear out parts you want to move, expand many of the structures you build, using a variety of smaller components to construct the larger whole, zone different areas for specific use, and much more.  Definitely a must for folks that enjoy managing, designing and building cities.	----->	6

87609750	Игра про пса, похожего на корги, который спасает свою хозяйку (старушенцию) из подземелья. По жанру - пазл+рогалик. Игра небольшая и симпатичная, умеренной сложности, идеально подходящая для кофе-брейков. Игровые сессии - по 10-15 минут. Контента тут немного, поэтому берите на распродаже.В основном уровни небольшие, 7*7 клеток. Задача - проложить маршрут, от входа до лестницы на следующий уровень. За собакеном тянется поводок, который нельзя пересекать. Т.е. механика “змейки”. На уровне сидит куча злобных монстров, которых нужно жрать, получая опыт и теряя здоровье. Для восполнения здоровья разбросаны аптечки. Также присутствуют монетки и сундуки золота (иногда это мимик), за золото можно купить бомбу или восстановление здоровья. Все просто и интуитивно понятно.Делает игру интересной то, что у многих монстров есть какие-то хитрые дополнительные правила. Например, черепах надо жрать с хвоста. Вампиры приносят кучу опыта, если их убивать с пустыми сердечками (без здоровья). Красные пауки требуют, чтобы мы предварительно сожрали трех любых монстров подряд, и т.д. Новые монстры и новые правила появляются чуть ли не каждый уровень. Правила не объясняются, но разобраться самому несложно, в этом основной фан.Не очень понятно, кстати, создаются эти карты случайным генератором или задизайнены вручную. Я склоняюсь к последнему варианту, из-за малого размера карт… ну или вариации есть, но очень небольшие, косметические. То есть каждое прохождение уровни немножко разные, но в целом их последовательность повторяется.Игра также отличается невероятной дружелюбностью к игроку! Можно вернуться на любое количество ходов назад - REWIND. Даже к стартовой позиции. (Разрабы позиционируют это чуть ли не как главную фишку.) Можно менять местами вход и выход (клавиша Enter), если кажется, что с другой стороны будет удобнее строить маршрут. Можно в любой момент закрыть окошко с игрой, при следующем открытии будет автоматически восстановлена та же позиция. Супер! Stress-free game. Погибнуть тут можно, только если пару раз на уровне убить собакена и недостаточно быстро отменить ход. Тогда появляется злобный призрак, который летит в нашу сторону, если долетит - убивает пса уже насовсем. Эта фишка взята из [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/418530/]Spelunky[/url].В общем-то, если решать уровни аккуратно, выстраивать оптимальный маршрут и не тупить, можно пройти все основные карты с первого же захода. Их не очень много :( Есть еще бонусные уровни. Но они более замороченные и стрессовые. Какие-то требуют проходить несколько карт подряд. Или проходить на время. Или с самого начала появляется убивающий собаку призрак. Но это уже не игра для перерыва на кофе, к сожалению. А на полноценную она никак не тянет.Если Фидель понравился, советую посмотреть [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/]The Witness[/url], там очень похожие паззловины. Такие же квадратные сетки со змейками, объектами и хитрыми правилами, которые надо разгадывать самостоятельно. Только игра сложнее и больше в 10 раз примерно.https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/	----->	0

87634979	I've been thoroughly enjoying this building-centric game. There's no conflict, so if your goal is building an army and fighting, find another game. Here you just build a medieval village/city and admire its beauty. It's an early access game with all sorts of quirks and a barebones UI, but I had great fun building my first city and look forward to returning from time to time to build another and to see what the community adds to the game. This a great evergreen game for those who just want to build something.	----->	15

87692964	A very enjoyable fun medieval city management game that strikes just the right balance between micro and macro management. Add to that the fact that the game keeps on getting better, and you have yourself a true little gem that will keep you entertained for hours.	----->	5
87697767	This is a beautiful game and is very intricate. At this point, there are really just a few thins to work out to improve the UI, but it is already a lot of fun. I'm hoping the developers expand elements of the game before and after release - increase trade options, more industries, etc. This game seems like something that can be built on for years to come.	----->	11
87697970	Let me start by saying this game is wonderful. Well crafted worlds with a wonderful art style. Gameplay is challenging enough to make you think but not so challenging that its overwhelming. I highly recommend this game to those interested in games like Banished, Sim City, Civ V, and any other city building sim games. This review is being writen in early access and even now there are so many things to do! Can't wait to see final release but already I give this game a solid 8/10. Only things I feel are missing are lack of threat (Attack from other citys, disease, bankrupt, stuff like this) and missing a lot of tooltips. However I feel a lot of these issues will be ironed out as the game moves towards release. Highly Highly recommend. Pick it up now and build your kingdom to glory!	----->	6

87733588	Such a great game! I love pretty much everything, from the organic residential zoning formation, to the random mining sites, to the control over the population needs. The only downside to the game is that it requires frequent stockpiling of food for the bad weather which lasts weeks, makes it rainy, etc. I believe this is an attempt to make a winter season, where food is harder to come by, but it only really affects the newcomers, serfs, and commoners, who rely on food affected negatively by the poor weather. If this was the intent, the bad weather should be predictable, like the seasons. If a player wanted to, then they should have an option to include natural disasters to add in more challenging scenarios.All in all, the weather is still manageable, so no biggie. Gameplay is still pretty intuitive, and the game is still challenging while managing the many facets of your towns. Overall, one of the best city builders I've played.	----->	0

87753518	Nice city builder game. Looks great, has all the features you would want. Some things I would like to see going foward would be military element making its way on to the actual map. having to defend and actually conquer other places. Also the supply management is a bit clunky. When you need to save resources and either not trade or not sell them, it doesn't seem that you can control that as it both links to the warehouse. I think it would be better if you could just store your goods somewhere like warehouse. Then take out a finite amount to put in the market or trade. That way when you need to pay the king, you don't have to try to figure out where it all is. Same with trying to understand the demand in the market, it becomes hard with the current system.	----->	5
87759777	Really lovely little village builder.  I keep coming back to it.  The hardest part is probably just feeling a bit overwhelmed at the beginning when you're not sure of the mechanics, but it just takes a little searching around and trying out different things before you get used to it, and the quests help guide you.  It looks beautiful, you kind of get to know your villagers over time, it's got a good budgeting system and the complexity builds appropriately.	----->	11

87840801	Recommend... More or less... This review is taking place during EA, which is always a little unfair. However, needs must. The game is quite enjoyable. At this point in time, it looks like most of the game is there. Graphically its OK. Although the UI does need work - especially when it comes to scaling... In terms of gameplay, yes its OK. Reminds me the most of Cultures in terms of gameplay. Will be interesting to see what the final version resembles. It is slow paced though and that is one of the faults, to my mind, as it's too slow. Another issue is with the AI of far travelling characters - i.e. builders. They will walk across the map with all their needs already empty, go to the building site, hit it once, and then turn round to go home to fulfil their needs. Why they couldn't top off before they left? It does slow down an already slow process.  I will say that after almost 17 hours of game time, I'm not sure what else is left to do, and I feel like I'm done with the game. So the Price/Hour is quite high, especially for a game of this type. But I enjoyed those hours, and I would recommend picking it up in a sale. 	----->	11

87872470	I like this game a lot.  The free-form building and painting style is great.  The pathfinding is excellent, intelligent, and forms with the free-form building and painting.  I really enjoy the mods and the mod selection within the game.  There is but two flaws.  First: I really dislike the popup menus with the buildings.  These popups should be able to be static and adjusted by the player to their standards.  Second:  Additional (Intelligent) key mapping is needed for the menus.  Such as: the build menu [B], Paint menu [P], Walls Menu [Shift+W], Estates [Shift+E], etc.....	----->	2

88050013	This type of game where its more about strategy and building things is why I like this game. So if you like to build towns and like the balancing of resources and money this is a pretty good game. The 3D effects and detail are pretty good as well. It still has a few glitches but not enough that its away from the game itself.	----->	14

88103633	Calm and cosy game with a lot of soul. Nice graphics and excellent way of executing a city builder. You can feel that it is still in alpha since its sorta thin in content, but it is very enjoyable nonetheless. It's not super intuitive at this point and the game doesn't help you learn, so watching a couple of YouTube videos to get a feel for the menus and mechanics might be a good idea. Will be very interesting to see this game in its final state!	----->	13

88142345	Absolutly adorable. Nice graphic, wirh some mods almost perfect! It lacks some balance without mods, I hope they will work on that. It would be also nice to have more productions (more fruits or vegetables). I suggest the game anyway, its very fun!	----->	5

88170004	I've been looking forward to a new supply chain strategy game for quite some time. I was really excited to learn a couple of years ago that the Settlers franchise was working on a new volume to their series. Then when it didn't release (likely due to the pandemic) I happened upon this game. Boy was I excited. This was exactly what I was looking for and none of the things I didn't want that the Settlers games tend to include. I'm also enjoying watching this game as it develops and find the new features and systems to be quite fun. I guess I'm glad the new Settlers game didn't come out in Dec 2020, I love this  game much better than the other Settlers games.	----->	14

88212441	A promising game.  The game has its detractors, and I have been one very recently as regards the new interface.  I still prefer the simplicity of the original.  But it all depends on what you where expecting.  I bought this game hoping for a Castle Building Sim and in that regard it has under promised and over delivered.  I was hoping to find more detail and more design freedom than other castle/fortification builders that I own such as Stronghold-HD,  Dawn of Man  etc.  For me, the economy portion is icing on the cake.  The base game is fine for economy modeling, but if you are really into castle building, there are some fantastic building parts mods for this game which will expand your design choices ten fold. The only thing I would want more, would to be able to call up an invading force to challenge your castle engineering skills but I don't miss it.  If you are into castle building with an added bonus of having to establish an economy for that construction project, this game is a must try.	----->	12

88254047	If like age of empires then you would like this. Great game if like stratigic ecconomic game play. A little complex to understand at first but just read the hints and tips and your be fine. Not an easy game, challenging but rewarding seeing your town/city grow and expand. Would like to see what happens if your town/city gets attacked.	----->	11

88396910	Overview - Recommended with a huge *BUT* includedRecommended for those who love colony builders with patience.*BUT* The regular price tag is VERY steep for the games initial offerings. I will try to be more subjective in this by saying it does have better graphics and a little more detail than some games that are similar. Objectively however I am becoming a little weary and frankly a bit disappointed with game creators and the direction they have taken with EARLY ACCESS. We get it. The game isn't finished and we can expect bugs while helping fund the remaining game and helping you sort out bugs. That is the trade off and it's a personal decision whether or not to agree to that. In return it should be priced at a lower and more fair price. It seems that tag is more and more becoming an easy way to get the games out earlier and make up funding deficits as they finish. No problem there either, but don't make people pay the final retail price. Charging a price that would seem fair as the final game price for early access titles doesn't seem like a fair trade off, and it seems like customers are beginning to now pay full prices for the benefit of developers, while still having less benefit from a finished game. They are getting their cake, and we are paying full price. In some cases these prices are lining up fairly, but I think we should all be careful what we support in Early Access to keep this in check. This game is priced at what I would say is a fair final purchase price, unless the amount of future content FAR outweighs what it seems plausible as of now. GRAPHICS - Very good for a colony builder. The little people have actions and animations, though the variety isn't that tremendous as far as their looks. The maps are very pretty and the overall game is pretty gorgeous. I run it on max graphics with an I-7 1070 and 32gb and it has no problems. If you need lower settings, I did try those and cant tell a difference that would make the game less enjoyable to look at. MECHANICS - The mechanics of managing the city and the building aspects are pretty well thought out. There are some nuances you will need to get used to, as there are some features you may not have found in other games. For example: You can build certain structures with multiple options or add to them later for extra space or assigning them extra utility values. This can be a little hard to get used to early on, as I have found myself wondering why a building wasn't being built, only to discover I never finished selecting the required parts and hit build. Finding whats wrong with unhappy people could use more detail. It may tell you overall what is wrong with some, but there could be more specifics. GAMEPLAY - The game plays well and has some challenge to it but will allow you time to get through the challenges without an instant death of your hard earned colony. I have found that food sources are some of the early inhibitors with colony growth because your colony will seem slow to advance in the first little while, then all of a sudden bursting at the seams with new people. You will have to set up ways to sell the raw materials you collect to your own villagers in order to afford to promote people and do any trading. The trading function, speaking of, is not as fleshed out as I think it could be. There is not as much detail on when they will trade, if trades have been completed, etc. Overall it has a good balance of challenge and relaxing design elements to keep me interested early on. A few small gripes - There are some particular areas of the game that need more detail and the map selection could be more diverse and larger. (Once you select the starting area, you will have to use your colony's funds to purchase more land. The areas you can purchase are limited by the needs of your colony and their proximity.) In addition, there could be a little better balance of raw material and food to collect in the limited starting areas you are given access to. It's worth a play if you like Banished and End Zone - games such as those, but if it is not a die hard passion, wait for a sale. You won't be missing anything that unique and you can hold off until the price is down.	----->	25

88470028	very enjoyable game since my first go, the early stages of the game some considered basic i personally found as enjoyable as i expected , just as i would approach the limits of the games current elements (building types, space to expand into etc.) an update would come along and add more. relaxing little city builder, as complicated or simple as you design it, the art/design style has been a great part of this game since the start and i hope it never changes.	----->	5

88477915	the game is amazing so far, i just have a nuisance, and it's that i can't earn Labour ticks, even though i rock labour splendour at about 70+ , the labour itself is still at ZERO, so i can't unlock any new structures beyond the first ones (you get labour 3 or 4 at the start, so you can unlock ballif office and eventually fishing hut)... I don't know if it's a bug or maybe i am doing something wrong, though i couldn't find anything on the internet guides.	----->	4

Obviously if it costs that much, there will be more at some point, but this game has been in Early Access for a while, and it doesn't seem like it is going anywhere. I've lost interest in it because of that, and I feel like I've wasted my money on it.	----->	-2

88720221	~~My review is about the VR version only~~VR is still very much a work in progress. The in game physics, VR, and networking worked the way my friends and I wanted it to about 10% of the time, but when it works, it is a very fun game to play with friends online.I hope the devs can continue to provide VR support and update it quickly but it took them years to get the VR update out in the first place. For $9 I don't think its worth it currently, but the game does go for very cheap on sales and can be bought for like $5. At $5, its only a decent price for VR players, because you will spend time trying to get the game to work every time you want to try to play.The custom map support is amazing to have for VR	----->	19

(except the comedown)You'll burn way to much time doing it.You'll spend more money than you should.The grind is horrid however, to the point I feel like you could become a top tier wow player faster than acquiring 50% of the parts in this game. For that aspect it does feel a bit pay to win. ( I have spent a good chunk of change on this game.)Is it worth a try? YesIs it worth putting money into? At one point it was but not anymore the game feels like a dead/dying playerbase. I often come across many of the same names which means often the same builds, weapons, etc. It feels like the playerbase is almost nonexistent at times.	----->	23

89071695	Pretty dope.  Some learning challenges but that is overcome with experimenting with the mixture of townpeeps, building variety, etc.I have not made it past a 300 person village and have restarted many times.  I make further progress every time and love the replay factor.	----->	5
89079702	Over 8 hours in, I think I'm almost finished with everything in the game. It really has been fun, and the different maps are fun to explore. There is quite a bit of management involved, and learning the trade system isn't really intuitive. I'm looking forward to a better UI, as its a bit small and can be hard to read for those with bad eyes. But I've had a lot of fun playing and I think will keep going until I own the whole map haha.	----->	6

89124045	Grate game so far.I would like a bit more war indipendence, like: more wpons (spears, bows); maybe some way of also difending from an atack - missions...My advice is also add more, like lords above citizens, they dimand cultural goods .... add cultural goods (art and stuf) that would be awsame.And maps more maps, but I think u are working on it.But behind it all, this is an easrly aces game, which screen shots im already saving next to my Cities skylines collection.

Glad I tried this one out![i]edit:[/i] It's been another 100 hours of play, now 350+ hours.  Still addicted.  Introduced my adult daughter to Foundation; now she's loving it, too!  I've not started with the available mods, yet...	----->	4

89318021	Great city-builder.  A bit heavy on micro managing but it is in alpha.  First time playing a gridless city builder and some of the buildings and their locations are decided by the villagers and not the players.  It creates a more real and dynamic city every time.	----->	0

89339632	Most important thing, this game is not playable. It is essentially multiplayer only but has an almost non-existent playerbase. Expect to wait upwards of an hour for a game. The only ~10-20 active players that actually play this game have their own discord server that they have to post in to find games. Ontop of this, there is no actual lobby/searching system, you have to just invite people to play.This is entirely a casual game of the like of among us with extremely little content, as the vast majority claim it should be much cheaper, it is comparable to a £5 game, not a £20 game. It does not have anywhere near the content or depth to justify this pricetag.Despite what the dev and the extremely small playerbase claim, there is no competive depth, at all, to this game. As the playerbase is extremely small with no matchmaking, the people I have played against have hundreds of hours in this game, while I have around 10 minutes (the playtime of 4 hours is almost entirely waiting for games), despite this I have won more games than I have lost. On top of this I have spectated 'top' players of this game from the sniper side and manage to quite often tell (with certainty) who the spy is before they do. This should make it incredibly obvious how little depth this game actually has. Imagine if someone who had played 10 minutes of chess could spot a forced mate before Magnus Carlsen (the reality is it's even worse than that, as the person actually playing has more tools available to them than the person just spectating, it's more compable to someone that had played 10 minutes of chess spotting a forced mate before Magnus Carlsen while also only being able to see half the pieces), or someone that had played 10 minutes of chess winning games more often than losing when playing against people with hundreds of hours.Finally, this game is NOT early access, no matter what is claimed. It has been public for a decade (well before the steam early access), and there is no actual updates to it. The last update to it that was anything other than a bugfix was almost 2 years ago, and it was just a small map. There has not been a single major update to it since it came to steam early access 3 years ago. It is clear this game will always be in the very poor alpha state it is in. That a multiplayer only game has been public for over a decade and still does not have as much as a search for game function is preposterous.Save your money.	----->	0

89363301	I felt a bit iffy about this game, I love cities skylines and city builders but for somer eason in my mind a medieval city builder had to also be an rts or something where the focus was fighting. Not sure why exactly I thought that because this game is really really awesome. I actually am enjoying it more then cities skylines.The only complaint I have is the UI could be better, but even with the UI lacking its pretty easy to get the hang of how to play. Other then that this game is amazing, definetly reccommend.	----->	7
89387243	its fun to play with friends, and the custome maps are actually fun as well. Overall I wasn't expecting this game to be as fun as it is! I will say tho the one annoying thing for me is that it doesn't load up the first time i start the game, a lot of times i have to exit the game fully and re launch everytime but other than that it's a fun game :)	----->	14

89456890	Foundation is so far an incredible game despite it's current state of development that is slowly changing the genre of city-building games. The progress it has made in decentralized development and free-style placement has created a unique and relaxing experience while playing the game. While the game is still lacking in much needed features like a logistics tab and a more streamlined U.I, the game plays well for both those who want a relaxing experience and those who want to micro their city into a new Rome. The aesthetics and visuals are quite pleasing and along with some music playing in the background, you become pretty invested in the game. While their is still plenty of work to do in order to better micro and manage important resources that could end your run, I am confident that this is a good foundation (Pun is unfortunately intended).	----->	16

89527781	In brief: It's cute and engaging. If you remember and enjoyed the original Settlers series then you'll probably like this. Pros:* Graphics are cute and overall very polished. Everything looks nice (with the exception noted below) and the people all look awesome. The fact that you can customise the look of larger buildings is extremely cool and buildings adapt to slopes reasonably well. * The zoning feature for houses adds a nice touch. You don't have complete control over where your citizens build their houses and that makes it feel much more organic.* It's atmospheric. Unless you're impatient just letting the music play and watching your people scurry around is quite relaxing * There is challenge in balancing the various needs of your people and the expansion of your village, unlocking new features etc. More dangers (see below) would help but for early access it's pretty good.Cons: * It could use a tutorial but if you're familiar with city builders then you'll pick it up quickly and the quests help step you through the major goals* It's pricey for what you get at the moment so buy on sale if you can* There are a few graphical issues like some assets floating slightly, especially on slopes. That looks a bit weird when you zoom in and is hopefully going to get a look as the game progresses. * A few more threats would help eg: roving bandits, wolves, floods, heat waves etc. The rain event seems to last for ever and gets a bit monotonous.	----->	19

89569115	[h1][b]A brilliant little gem that is really three games in one![/b][/h1]Build an organically laid out medieval Europe village that develops into a town or city in beautiful terrain with detailed structures and a challenging economic system. You'll face varying issues like why are my farmers suddenly planting only 1/2 to 1/3 of the usual amount and causing my people to starve? Why do my markets keep running out of food? Why have my tailors suddenly stopped producing clothes during even though there's an abundance of cloth?  How tall can I really make this Lord Manor tower!?! Managing all of these will require mastering all three games.After 347 hours of gameplay on the same map with many many restarts, my last save game has 1,300 villagers and a stable economy. Here's what I learned. I consider this game to be a brilliant black box machine with a few tricks to keep one entertained, and well worth the money! I paid full price for this game.[u]Early Gam / City Builder[/u]The early game is a city builder. You start by learning the economic chains, watch the development of the organic pathing and residential layouts, and begin laying out your first buildings. You get to piece together your first Lord Manor with beautiful models, infinite variability and options, and discover by hitting the letter [i]t[/i] you are no longer constrained to the pre-determined attachments, but can place parts any which way you choose! Somewhere about 150 to 200 villagers, you notice things start to go awry. Your people are starving, can't' find housing, are thirsty, can't get a seat in their local church, their productivity goes to nothing and your economy collapses. You barely have enough money to place a new Gathering Hut, although with the complete food shortage, it wouldn't help anyways, as no new villagers are willing to join your village. What's worse is the markets are bare of food and your hungry people are finally abandoning your village altogether. Why are they all thirsty anyways, I put wells everywhere!That's when you realize this is not just a city builder, it's also a logistics game, and your logistics needed to be taken into consideration from the very start. Time to restart.[u]Mid-Game / Logistics Game[/u]In order to make it into the mid-game, about 150 to 500-650 villagers, you are going to need a good logistics system. Bad weather will starve your production, increasing demand will necessitate markets have supplies closer, and critical manufacturing of goods needs to be organized. The ultimate logistics tool for averaging out problems is the buffer, represented as granaries and warehouses. Having them in the right places with the right mix of raw resources, goods, luxury goods, and foods will get you through the mid-game successfully.And then you enter the late-game, and once again, your economy begins to collapse in dramatic fashion. You start to notice some weird behaviors - why is the tailor crossing the entire map to get some clothes? By the time he gets home, he needs new clothes, and marches off again across the map, never working again. Doesn't she make her own clothes? Why are thirsty villagers walking right by wells and not stopping to drink? Wha tmakes intuitive sense no longer works in the game. Now, however, you have to dig deeper. Using the follow-a-villager in-game tool, you begin to decipher the villager behaviors and learn how the villagers make decisions. Ah, the tailor buys clothes from a market, and the only market with clothes is all the way across the map. The villagers prefer to drink from the well close to home, and home is a long way from work, so they leave in the middle of work to get a drink. The serfs also now live a long way from home because they got kicked out of their original serf home when it was upgraded by a newly-promoted commoner.And then it hits you - this is not just a city builder, and it's not just a logistics game, it's also a design game. And you have to play all three games at once to be successful through the end game! Time to restart with new information and considerations.[u]Late Game / Design Game[/u]In order to thrive through the late game, there are many design considerations to take into account. Designing the well/market/church/work/home layout to optimize villagers, designing the promotion order to maximize work while minimizing villagers moving a long way away, leaving space for future logistics expansion to support an increasingly dense village/town/city while effectively transporting goods across the map, not over-building and increasing your maintenance cost to unsustainable levels whille not underbuilding leading to economic ruin, and preparing supplies for known future expansions that require enormous amounts of materials like the monastery and huge gate. When you first play this game, it's just a city builder. But if you fail to play the logistics or design game that is hidden within, your village will come to ruin in the mid to late game.[u]Tips and Tricks[/u][b]Sometimes you have to run the game at 2x or 1x speed.[/b] There came a point when running the game at 3x speed seems to not allow the villager AI to make decisions as fast. This results in, for example, farmers in the sowing season taking a very long time to move on to the next patch of land, and significantly reducing their planting. By slowing the game to 2x, and later to 1x, they went back to planting the full farm.[b]Buffers, buffers, buffers.[/b] You can average out almost any economic ups and downs with buffers, represented as granaries and warehouses. [b]Promote wisely.[/b] The first promotion to serf can dramatically incrase villager efficiency because they will now live close to work and won't travel back to the village center all the time, but hey will also want food, water, and church close by. After that, every promotion will increase your income as the villagers increase income, but their efficiency will reduce because they spend more time filling their needs.[b]Commoners will kick out serfs.[/b] When you promote a villager to commoner, the first thing they do is upgrade their house. The second thing they do it to kick out all the serfs. This leads to odd situations where you can have a commoner living in a huge 6-person house while 5 serfs now move a long way away from work, reducing their efficiency.[b]Villagers will out-walk their needs to get their needs met![/b] If a villager wants goods, they will walk across the entire map to a market that has goods. By the time they get home, they will not have time to work because they are hungry, thirsty, need some church/faith, and ... more goods! Failure to ensure your villager needs are available locally at all stages of the game will lead to an economic death-spiral. [b]Don't overbuild. Don't underbuild.[/b] In the early game, there's a temptation to both overbuild by placing an extra wheat farm or five, or underbuild by trying to only build the minimum to save money. Overbuilding leads to being unable to pay the building maintenance, and underbuilding leads to not having enough to fill the villagers needs. [b]Balance promotion and logistics.[/b] Promoting brings in more money due to consumption, but reduces villager work efficiency because they spend more time filling their needs. Depending on who you promote, you may need to compensate with more production. Some jobs are non-critical and can be promoted whenever, whereas some jobs are critical and need to be promoted carefully.	----->	22

89592531	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL97nH5EPrA[h1] First Impressions [/h1] I received Fidel Dungeon Rescue (FDR) all the way back in 2016 from a Humble Bundle monthly deal, which is somewhat strange as the game only released in 2017. I don't remember what occurred with the game, but I have it in my inventory either way, and I thought a theoretically shorter game like this would be nice to play through. Since it's a puzzle-based roguelite, I wouldn't expect it to take that long to beat, but there was only one way to find out. [h1] Gameplay [/h1] FDR uses random generation to create most of its puzzles, so that unlike many other puzzle games, it's not possible to resort to a walkthrough to mindlessly play through everything and be done with it. This is where the roguelite aspect comes in, because even though you can rewind the steps you've taken in the puzzle, it's possible to make moves that'll kill the dog. This creates an immediate time limit where you either clear the floor you're on and continue with the run, or get nabbed by the ghost and have to start from the first floor again. I find this somewhat unnecessary, as you otherwise have all the time you need to think out solutions, and can only kill the dog if you don't know how interacting with an enemy or obstacle works, or don't pay enough attention. Nothing is explained in the game, so all of it has to be learned solely from your own experimentation and trial and error. There's an element of trial and error to all puzzle games, and an open mind is valuable to solve problems. However, some of the mechanics and interactions in FDR are quite specific, such as how to defeat the robot and purple dog stages and that defeating the vampires requires you to have no health. This in turn leads to puzzles that require a particular approach and solution, which you may miss completely having not figured out enough of the mechanics yet. I see many guides and videos over how things worked early on, but not so much after it updated in 2018. Having played for a few hours, I don't know quite a few things, and I've been trying all the game modes multiple times. For instance, what the benefit would be in stealing the golden face mask from the tribal warriors. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431925178[h1] Controls [/h1] It's possible to play FDR with either a controller or keyboard, and for ease I went with a controller myself. Movement can be directed with either the 'L joystick' or 'D-pad.' To access the next floor, hit 'A.' The dog can bark with the 'R shoulder,' and you'll want to try barking at everything to find out everything it can do. 'L shoulder' rewinds your moves. There's nothing wrong with starting over from the beginning, but if you only screwed up a more recent move, don't hold that button down because you can't undo a rewind. If you have enough gold coins, you can either bomb enemies or refill all health with 'X' and 'B' respectively. [h1] Story [/h1] There's an ending clip that plays if you beat the right game mode, potentially having to meet certain requirements. It's also possible to bring up a short opening cutscene showing an old lady being kidnapped for reasons completely unknown. Otherwise though, like everything else, there's no explanation behind what's going on or why. [h1] Graphics [/h1] With how overhead puzzle games tend to work, there's a lot of repetition because you're working with a grid system. This means that the floor tiles will be copy/pasted squares. However, there's enough detail and variety on these that no floor looks flat or bland. Some enemies have minor changes, but they're reused because of their similarities. For instance, how the red spiders will be vulnerable if you complete a triple, which is sometimes built off of the tiny, harmless spiders. Due to how enough changes are made in important areas, the game has enough novelty that the graphics are a highlight to the puzzles instead of a hindrance. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431925553[h1] Sound Design [/h1] The music in FDR has a nice dreariness that fits the dark dungeon setting and spooky environment. They're more lively and energetic than might be expected out of a puzzle game, but I didn't find it distracting or out of place. There aren't many sound effects, though what was used seemed appropriate. Explosions had the right impact, and the haunting sound of the ghost pursuing you was eerie. [h1] Pros [/h1] 🌟 There's a nice variety in puzzle elements, such as enemy types and objects that change the layout and how you approach an obstacle. For instance, XP barriers, switches, and keys. 🌟 Unlocking the other 2 dogs gives the gameplay a nice change of pace as you play through the other game modes with their different mechanics. [h1] Cons [/h1] ❌ Although the game is pretty basic and not that demanding as it's smaller than 200 MB, it's got some technical issues. If playing in short increments, you won't notice anything, but if you play for an hour or so, there's a good chance the game will bug out. Thankfully the game will save its progress wherever you are in the moment, so closing and restarting isn't a big deal, yet I'd still expect more stability regardless. ❌ Supposedly each puzzle that's generated is solvable. However, there's nothing in-game that reinforces this idea, and if you get stumped you'll just have to restart the dungeon from the first floor. [h1] Tips [/h1]🔍 Unless you're attempting to earn an achievement or playing a particular mode, there's no rush in figuring out how to clear a stage in the most optimal way possible. Something that helps with pathing is to keep in mind whether the moves you're taking bar your exit, because finding a good route for coins or XP is worthless if you wind up blocked off from the exit. 🔍 You'll want to know how much damage you take from crashing into enemies, though most do only 1 or 2 hearts of damage. That way you can avoid dying on accident, which triggers the ghost to spawn. You're allowed one courtesy death per stage in most modes, but if you die again, the ghost will pursue you, and most likely end your run. 🔍 There's rarely a point in taking damage from an enemy if you don't get XP from it. For instance, an alert tribal warrior won't give any XP if you run into it, you only get XP if he's asleep, so you're taking damage for no gain. [h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] A certain degree of my issue with FDR stems from not knowing more about how floors are randomly generated and the logic behind solving the puzzles. This is an unexpected side effect of floors not having a perfect, all-clear solution, where every item is obtainable and every enemy can be defeated, as that would resolve this problem. Even putting this issue aside, there's not very many puzzles to solve in this puzzle game, or at least not where you'd expect. The 2 adventures contain 15 and 10 levels to get through, the cemetery where you can get rid of the ghost has 4 levels, there are only 10 somewhat pre-set puzzles in puzzle mode, and the caterpillar challenge also has 10 stages. So were it not for the procedural, random nature of the puzzles artificially lengthening the content, as well as being forced to figure things out yourself, there'd be very little to actually play through in FDR. Sadly, the focus was on creating a year's worth of daily challenges for an obnoxious achievement (requires playing the game across 319 days), instead of developing more puzzles for players to solve in the other game modes.

89716114	So first I will start off by saying I 100% recommend this game. As several other reviewers have said, this game offers a far more controlled gaming experience while pulling in elements of some of our favorite City Builder games. I have played just under 17 hours and will absolutely continue to do so. My advice for newcomers: You'll need to watch your 'Happiness' the most. Similar to CIV V this is key to whether or not your village will prosper. If too many villagers feel a certain need is not being met, they will leave. Which opens up holes in your supply chains and therefore economy. Very quickly you can go from thriving to spiraling out of control. The biggest part of this comes from the 'promotion' tab. Once you have promoted villagers really to Serf+ (but especially Commoner and Citizen) they start needing more food, luxury goods, and religion. (more on this below in my suggestions to Devs) So be careful when choosing how many people to promote. This is important for happiness, but if you promote too many people too quickly, their luxury needs will start dropping happiness quickly. Take advantage of the Military functions. My village has no direct source of Iron, but you get Iron, bread, tools, coin and more from completing military campaigns for the crown. (make sure their swords are quipped before sending them on the mission! I think many of us learned that the hard way)[u] As an Early Access game, these are some things I think could use some work: [/u]- So far my game has only crashed twice. Both times it was when I tried to use the 'Walls' tab. - I don't personally feel the tutorials go into enough detail and there are several missing. Most of the answers I needed I had to turn to Google/Reddit to find. It took me forever for example, to fully figure out how the warehouse connects to the trade window. Similarly it should be more clear that the 'square' next to a soldier names is where you equip a sword, which is necessary for them to succeed on their mission. Several Reddit threads exist for this since it was not clear. If it says 'Fully Trained' in green next to a soldiers name, we assume they are good to go, not that we are sending them to their deaths.- Needing 4 churches for a village of 75 people is a bit extreme. I understand religion was especially important during the times in which this game is replicating, but it should be possible to increase the size of an existing church to meet this need instead. I shouldn't need 4 churches in a fairly small town in order to avoid people leaving. Especially with how many resources those take to build. - Wine is a luxury good needed for Commoner/Citizen happiness, yet the only way to get that is through trade (-$$$) or building a monastery. I feel we should be able to build a vineyard just like we can harvest hop for beer instead of having to wait until we have 10 citizens and 40 clergy splendor, or spending a ton on it through trade.- A more picky visual suggestion would be to make the icons for all of the various tabs larger, and to make those tabs a little more graphically pleasing. Since so much of the game is worked through the various tabs and pop-out windows it would be nice if they looked a bit more updated. I'm sure I will add more as I continue to play and as they continue to develop the game. While I have a lot of feedback, I really do highly recommend this game for those looking for a more controlled and interactive City Builder experience.	----->	30

89826439	This game can be a nice relaxing city builder where you can spend all your time designing and constructing churches, manors, and castles to your heart's content. It can also be a nice economic simulator where you build a powerhouse of trade and dominate the kingdom's economy through your trade routes and economic outputs. Or anything in between. I have played complete city builders that offer less features than this game which is still in early access and found it well worth the price.	----->	8

89887918	Overall i will give it a thumbs up. I hope for more content as the game progresses in development as i feel it is a 90% resource management 10% city building.  The resource management can get a bit tedious from time to time but overall is very well done. I would however like to see more optimization on the trade front as it is dry. I should be able to set buy/sell amounts and the orders actually get filled. I had to restart many games because of a project that was started that drained all of a particular resource and happiness went out of control. It was highly annoying. I also found that once i unlocked and built everything is when the enjoyment began to fade but once again added content can help manage this.	----->	7

89940665	Been playing Foundation now for couple of weeks and loving the concept of the game and it's originality.  I know is a game still in development but from what I've seen through playing this Early Access version I can't wait for the final version. Graphics are brilliant and the menus are easy to follow. Built in help guide in the game helps. In my opinion this is a brilliant game now and in the making a would definitely recommend this if you interested in city building type games.	----->	17

90074776	There's almost complete freedom in the way you structure not only your town, but your buildings, as well! The roads form naturally, making this both one of the most streamlined city builders, as well as one of the most natural looking!It took a minute to figure out how to get through the menus, but there's something very classic-WIN95 about the menus and windows you use to navigate, and I have grown to love having as many windows in my screen space as I choose, wherever I choose!I will be playing much more of this wonderfully crafted charmer!	----->	6

90219424	Oh man I am having so much fun with this game.The grid-less mechanic is breath of fresh air after having grown up on standardized city building simulators. Being able to watch the organic growth of your village is a joy, giving it a picture-esque view that is a real beauty to artistic gamers. For the supply line and resource management gamers, hold onto your pickaxes because you're in for an adventure. The game starts you off with a few simple chains to manage, but over the lifespan of your village the amount of resources you can harvest and goods you can produce grows tremendously. I haven't enjoyed a mechanic this much since City:Skylines released their Industrial DLC. Many other reviewers have laid out the pros and cons of this game far more efficiently, what with it being in Early Access at this point in time. The main drawback seems to be the pretty hefty price tag, but I didn't have to wait long to snag it in a decent Steam sell. Even then, it's felt worth every penny since I've started playing. Definitely put this one on your wishlist. It's a ton of fun.	----->	10

90231778	I first played this game well over a year ago and maybe closer to two. I had a fantastic time playing it even then when a lot of features were still missing. I stopped playing because I didn't want to ruin the experience of playing the completed game. I still think this game will be a lot of fun when released but it is a bit concerning that when I last played it so long ago and it looked 75% complete then, how is it two years later and they don't seem to have progressed all that much? I mean I know next to nothing about game development but when I last played it, it was just features that were missing such as more and different types of resources and not really any core game play. Just not understanding why it's taking so long.	----->	4

90547757	A fantastic and unique game, with an awful lot of depth.  I've put it 100s of hours to this (I don't normally play through steam, hence the very small amount of time here) - it has a very welcoming and friendly community (in the official discord) and an active competitive scene.A lot of comments mentioning the price are comparing this to party games, which is not where SpyParty is aimed at - it can have as much depth as a serious 1v1 game as you want to get out of it.  (but is also fun for introducing to friends for a laugh :D )Highly recommended - SpyParty is a lot more than just a party game!	----->	14

Every time I started a new village - I've been discovering some new game mechanics and now with my 33hrs of gameplay - I must say this is far above my expectations from the Alpha version! (and that's even without considering available mods). Let me tell you - Foundation is an absolute must have piece in your city-builder collection!	----->	3

90703901	Top notch game, and I love the taxes in this; it's a huge change compared to what I'm used to. I also love that you can build up an army. I do, however, wish that the gameplay was more interesting. It's pretty much the same old routine when building up the city, and the only challenges I face are keeping food stocked through storms, and keeping happiness up. Everything else I find too easy. There's no serious repercussions for shortage of food, just a few people will leave every now and then, which isn't really a bother since I have a ton of unemployed villagers.	----->	6

90766001	Not recommended right now. The game is nice, but isn't finished. That is understood and accepted. Early access and all. But.No update in over 3 months, and no official communication from the devs whatsoever. This is NOT how you should run an early access game. Give your investors at least bi-weekly updates on how the development is progressing. Be upfront about issues you are having, if any. Keep your roadmap updated. These are things that BUILD TRUST with the people that believed in your project enough for them to give you their money before the product is finished.Not arguing that the project is dead or dying, or the developers ran with the money - but going early access means you have a MORAL OBLIGATION to engage with the people who decided to buy in early, and to not go AWOL for over a quarter of a year. You can't just forget about that. It's extremely unprofessional. Get your shit together.EDIT:It's been a long time. I recently took another look and it does seem the developer is regularly providing updates and information. The game looks pretty solid for what it is, so I am changing my review to recommended now.	----->	-1

91052566	It's actually impressive how the game is done that well already in alpha stage but I do hope they will do much more. I personally would prefer animals and night time as well. For people who are considering in buying it:I personally find that it's easier to learn the game's mechanics when it's still in Alpha state because in later state, the game might have a lot more functions and therefore it's more difficult to learn the game. If you are like me, you will not regret buying that game. But if you are that type of a person who expects a lot, I recommend on waiting a bit more.	----->	6

91204064	Fantastic 1v1 game. Works really well if you're talking to your opponent after the match to learn how they spotted you. The replay UI is fantastic, but the in-game UI is absolutely tiny on my 1440p monitor, and the dev hasn't addressed this in probably two years.This is a game of skill and patience, and if you're in the right headspace, you can probably play this for hours. I know people still play this daily.	----->	0

ITS UNRECOGNIZABLE TO ME AND NOT ANYWHERE IN MY LIST OF TRADEABLE ITEMS, SO IT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME WHY THEY'D WANT SOMETHING I DO NOT HAVE YET. THE GAME IS TOTALLY OFF AND THE MODS DON'T HELP IT MUCH EITHER.	----->	0
91673110	I have played for almost 50 hours. The game was fun, BUT, I am now bored, with little drive to continue playing.

92181623	Phenomenal fun, but expensive. Great gameplay, combination of a deckbuilder and tower defense/MOBA. But cards are really hard to accrue, and the monetization model is painfully unforgiving.There is often an advantage given to certain powerful cards, especially the higher-mana ones.The power tokens (lootboxes) seem rigged, often choosing from the same small pool of available cards and nearly never resulting in the rarer cards.Expect to spend a LOT of money (hundreds of dollars) if you hope to complete your collection (or even build a suitable deck) within a human lifetime or two.	----->	6

92369853	Great game in almost all respects but it tends to get a bit less exciting at the later part of the game. Once all buildings have been unlocked and built, just growing the city does not add that much excitement - an invading army, or any other type of disaster, would have spiced things up a bit. Then again, one can just start a new town - like I just did for the fifth time - and all is good once more :-)	----->	12

Some maps are terrible, but in the end I think it's still worth buying the game for such a low price if you have friends to play with.cons: This game is seemingly in permanent alpha, and there are a few crashes (always after a match, never in the middle of the golf match) but still worth it just cause it's cheap.	----->	19

92446843	I like the concept but here's the absolute crucial thing:Only buy the game if you intend to play with someone else. Solo queueing is basically like buying a non-functioning game. You won't find matches by yourself.I refunded it myself given the circumstances but I think I'll still pick it up in the future when it's cheaper and there's more players. Currently as is, I can only really recommend it to people who have people to play with. Otherwise you can play daily challenges by yourself if you think that'll satisfy your gameplay needs.	----->	6

92468041	At first the game was difficullt on the off set but it was nice that the tips box appears to get me going, after several hours now I'm enjoying the game, I like the music althought not much of it. the poly like graphics and i know being an Alpha they are working on the UI overhaul. There are some things still missing i believe to aide/help the player, I was struggling to understand why my happiness was dropping rapidily I didn't know you need to add more to the churches for example. overall I think it's a neat concept that can only grow in good time. I waited over a year before purchase and was not disapointed. Making a town with no fore planning can really make the best looking towns.	----->	13

92480876	I don't like early access games, but this one is fun. The military missions need work, also why can't I upgrade a church? The organic path-finding is a unique twist that makes housing fun.  I'm looking forward to the upcoming UI update because that is one thing that needs work, glad to hear it's soon. play this game, it's relaxing.	----->	5
92481532	Fun and having a good time, but I CANNOT get the Upgrades tab to load! It's infuriating. It's been bugged for the last ~7h of playing. I cannot sell cosmetics I have attained to gamble for a different one. Definitely shoots down my vibe. My friends have a similar experience, but theirs eventually loads after exiting and restarting the game a couple times. This also has to be done for any new cosmetics you get, as they don't register during that same session.It's an enjoyable game and I really like it, I was just hoping it would be a bit more polished for having been in Early Access for 4+ years. Really bummed out I can't sell my rares. Tried uninstalling twice and nothing. Lost cause I guess.	----->	7

I have restarted my town a few times trying to work out the best method to build up to a decent size. I've gotten to about 200 people with a comfortable happiness level. I'd recommend playing the different maps to find the one you like and after that, just have fun!	----->	14

93073056	I love this game. Much like other titles such as Ostriv or the upcoming Manor Lords, this is non-grid based, instead it's focused on building organic cities with a sense of realism accompanied by dynamic management challenges that come with growing a city. I heartily recommend this game for anyone who likes city builders or especially medieval city builders, this game isn't easy, but it's also not as hard as some games to survive in. It isn't hard to not starve your settlement to death, but likewise I've found it a challenge to plan and manage production and resources while keeping a balanced budget and an efficient city design, this game, although relaxing for most of the time, requires some thinking ahead to build efficient cities. The art style is very appealing, it isn't hyper realistic in its style, but the buildings and homes adhere to actual designs and styles primarily from Medieval Western Europe. Some people say this isn't worth $30 and I disagree, it has lots of good features, so far I haven't run into any bugs or freezes. I can't comment on the performance otherwise since my laptop is older and starting to show its age. The game starts out like most city builders, a few villagers and some resources, you've got to zone and build things. Your villagers build their own homes, wherever they'd like within your zoning, the streets and paths develop mostly organically although you can control them if you want. They require food and depending on their social status, luxury goods or entertainment. It is pretty standard in that sense. The management I don't find particularly tedious. Granaries and storehouses are also significant and as are distribution points like markets. Trade and warfare are two unique aspects of the game which are not totally fleshed out yet but add to the game and provide a good source of cash, which will influence how you decide to build your cities, which is certainly a good thing in my book. Special buildings, your manor, churches, monasteries, taverns, and military facilities can be designed by the player. This is a pretty unique feature and very fun. There are some aspects of social management as well, you can collect taxes and require favor from the various estates to be able to advance in certain categories and unlock more advanced buildings. There are a good deal of things  to take into account when starting up, but they're easy to get the hang of. I think, especially as development continues they will become deeper, although I think this game is worth the $ as it is. In short, this is a fun and fresh take of medieval city building that presents the player with a relaxing time if he's willing to plan ahead. It isn't too challenging or complex that the beginner will kill off his city several times before being successful, but you won't waltz through this game either if you want to be able to really tailor your city to your exact desires.	----->	38

93087905	So I really enjoyed the game. It is my favorite type of game, but like a lot of these games it quickly becomes too much to handle. It might be apart of the genre, but like a lot of cities there are delegation and I wish I could use that concept. I am horrible with city schematics and need a little help. I can only do so much lol. Besides that its a fun game!	----->	8

93606718	One of the best medieval village building game there is. It is still in early access, but already felt like a fully built game. A few minor crashes here and there, but the autosave function really helps to maintain your progress, I recommend you keep it on. There are some functions that the devs are still building, so be patient with that. Otherwise, the animations, graphics, and attention to detail are just fantastic; highly recommend. Perfectly relaxed game for you to unwind for the day.PS: If you get stuck with some of the gameplay, join the subreddit or Fb page, the community is really helpful	----->	12

93628751	A very interesting and fun to play game!	----->	6
93629047	Fun little game. It's always a bit hard to tell why one game of this type feels superior to others, but this one does. The graphics are stylized but not to the point of being overly cute or intended for children. The music is soothing. The mechanics are easy to grasp but complex enough to justify, well, 90 hours of gameplay in my case. Only stopped playing when my town got so large that the framerate dropped to a near-slideshow. Weakest element of the game is the combat. You train named soldiers, group them, then send your armies offscreen to fight neighboring kingdoms, but the combat is very bare-bones and automated. I'm guessing they'll improve it.	----->	3

93864536	I really like this game. It's a slow paced city builder/economy simulation. It's not too complex andrelaxing to play. It looks pretty nice too, almost like a living Carcassonne.  If you're looking for something with a high level of strategy and tons of upgrade trees this is not it.  If you like building castles and pondering the layout of the land as your population and economy grows this may be for you. I've played for nearly 30 hours over the course of the last few months, I'd say that justifies the price. Looking forward to see where this EA goes.	----->	10

93929318	This game is absolutely great, for being in early access of course. It does have some minor troubles and flaws fluttered around though. Here is my list of pros and cons to the game (from what I've experienced so far:TLDR: The game is absolutely great, but needs to be updated more to fix some minor problems. It's worth buying, but it'd be better to wait for it to go on sale if you want it to be worth your money (but at least it isn't a steaming pile of garbage).Pros:-Very interactive; you get to easily customize names of villagers, buildings, etc. and assign jobs to specific villagers (though you can also just quickly assign jobs to random unemployed villagers)-Unlockable hexagonal tiles (that don't increase in unlock price, just in taxes)-You don't have to plan roads, as villagers pave paths that they find easiest to use (just by walking on that path)-There is a good modding community that adds to the flavour of the game-The maps in the unmodded game are actually pretty decent, despite some resource issues-It's easy to let the game sit idle while you're doing something else, but you can also micro-manage as much as you wantCons:-It's kind of difficult to first get into the game since the help tab isn't very helpful at times-I can't seem to get past a population of 50 without using mods, but that could just be me to be honest-There isn't much in terms of a creative mode unless you use mods, but thankfully the mods are very good-It's difficult to create 2 markets far apart from each other, as villagers will seemingly just randomly choose which one to go to, and will run out of other needs before getting there and back-I'm on a pretty low graphics setting but only get a max frame rate of 24fps (fps seems to become an issue after about 80 villagers, but at that point some things are too much to manage anyway, so I usually just start another village)	----->	18

The game is, after all, under development. But it's plenty playable.I am sure this game will satisfy all of the Settlers 2 Gold fans out there. I am one, and I enjoying Foundation a lot! It's different enough that it doesn't feel like a copy (I love the zoning concept). And it's similar enough that it feels like coming home.Great work devs!	----->	13

94305638	Good VR game for the price, it is still early access and there are definitely some things that need to be worked out.The graphics are good and the courses are awesome looking with a great variety of holes.The teleport area is way way way to big so its hard to tell where your going to be lined up with the ball, definitely slows things down when playing with other players.Its also hard to tell if you went off the map and the ball is going to reset on some of the holes. A big thing is there is no left hand, so your playing one handed.... I really would like to use two hands if possible. The biggest thing is the power level on the swings, sometimes you hit hard and the ball goes nowhere other times you hit it with that same power and it goes flying off the map. Would like to see this be a little more consistent, granted I only played for an hour.All and all I like the game and recommend it and I can't wait to see what they do with it.	----->	17

94543983	ONE HOUR SNAP JUDGMENTFoundation is a gridless city-builder with many systems including trade, religion, production-chains, happiness, quests, and much more.  It was much deeper than I anticipated and so far I am having a great time with this game.  Highly Recommended if you enjoy games like Banished.PROS+ Freedom to build virtually anywhere+ Classic job system improved by citizen levels and promotions+ Excellent graphics, excellent UI, good music+ Organic village feel with paths and homes being built automatically+ Lots of additional systems like trade, kingdom relationships, villager promotions+ Random events and quests keep things interesting+ Feels stable and polishedCONS- Some features confusing (building large, modular structures)- Some features confusing (how do I deliver 30 berries to the King?)- Frequent information overload (has a CLOSE ALL WINDOWS button)	----->	14

94743317	Nice chill village building game. Most of the time this is good to play when you have a podcast or show open in the other window. Sometimes you'll need all your focus.

94744937	A very relaxing game which requires a lot of logic, creativity and exceptional management skills. As the game progresses you need to take into account a multitude of variables and take critical decisions to improve your economy and also improve the well being of your citizens. Ability to plan ahead and build the right structures in the right places will turn out to be some of the most critical success factors as you progress in the game. Try to optimize processes and resources wherever possible. Maximize trade and use promotions wisely!	----->	8

94856390	I've only played with the new interface that was released recently because I just started this week. I've been intrigued by learning all the systems in the game and only occasionally frustrated when a few of the features are non-intuitive. It's a beautiful game that has had me playing non-stop for a few days now. If you get hung up about dealing with minutiae in a game, this is not the one for you. It's almost entirely peon and resource management.	----->	1

94864645	It's like an improved version of stonehearth.The bugs I spotted was as follows1- When you destroy workplaces workers are still assigned to that workplace and you need to remove them manually before destroying workplaces.2- Some of the npcs are stuck at the map's limits and at houses so they can't go to work.3- Woodcutters are not going to far places, may be it can be like in stoneheath, if we can just assign a region to cut down immidiatly it would be the best option to avoid resource shortage. I think there should be more detailed systems on trading and on economy. 	----->	-2
94869247	Foundation is challenging and very fun at the same time. It's awesome to watch your village grow and progress but can get very out of hand really quickly. A different kind of strategy game than I'm used to. I would recommend this game to anybody!	----->	14

94898631	This game reminds me a lot of Banished. It's a very good city builder, and I personally really enjoyed the dynamic growth of my village. I'm not drawing roads or assigned routes, the only thing that matters is what buildings I have placed and where. This includes things like having houses near enough to my job sites that villagers aren't wasting all of their time walking to work, instead of actually working.This is a game about supply chains, but you can only control those supply chains in a sort of top down abstract way. You can't specify delivery frequency or supply priority. You have to just make sure your warehouses are kept stocked, or that you shutdown production at low priority buildings.The tutorial could use some work, but I don't personally have any issue with playing for an hour, realizing I have made an irreparable error, starting over and making it two hours before messing up again. Little my little you learn how to grow a thriving city.	----->	8

94966920	Early days, but this is a great city builder sim so far. My only real complaint so far has been the collision detection between villager houses and other buildings - I had several villagers decide to build right into my church and manor house...Learning curve has not been too steep, either. though maybe that will change. Anyway, glad I bought in and hoping this continues to improve!	----->	6

However after playing 12 hours I can say i am really frustrated with the fact that i can put down roads and the AI for pathing in the game is still a little basic my citizens are walking the entire way around a hexagon the far way instead of using the clearing i had excavated to take the short way around. I really hope that they implement some way of putting roads down soon as it would make the game much more enjoyable and allow a greater amount of control in the city	----->	7

95204401	A year plus into alpha and Foundation persists as one of the most satisfying city builders I've ever laid hands on. The UI overhaul is a vast improvement and much needed addition to the game.I have only one complaint. As development has gone on, the game has become bogged down with frustrating mechanics that change the feel of the game play from a relaxing sandbox experience where your creativity is unlimited, to a stressful, frustrating management simulator. Newcomers will sometimes continuously leave without a tool for identifying the cause. There is an infuriating RNG component to immigration even when your happiness is peaked, and sometimes pathways will be obstructed as a result of the way your citizens free-build, the game lacking quick and effective tools for targeting the jam and subsequently fixing it.My ask is that the devs make the systems balance more forgiving, and perhaps even remove collision altogether. If that ruins the challenge for some players, I'd be happy with difficulty settings that let me tune the experience so that I can focus more on architecture, design elements and city sprawl, rather than making sure everything works right.	----->	-2

Things such as trade, military missions, and luxury resource development took a while to figure out.  Overall the atmosphere of the game is enough to justify figuring it all out and I look forward to continued updates now that I have played into the mid-late game.	----->	8

95600502	What an amazing game! 27 hours in and I've had this only a couple of days! This is my second early access game ever and I've not had a single crash or any other glitches. I'm running a pretty mediocre rig and frame rates are pretty consistently at 60fps without sweating. Load times are pretty good and with an original download size of ~3Gb you're getting a fair bit of game that doesn't feel bloated. The recent UI overhaul is positively stunning (not that I played the old one but have seen it on YouTube.) The ability to just drag windows wherever and stack them to keep an eye on progress or just hide them all with a single click is an OCD paradise. The frosted glass look on each window adds to the overall aesthetic, devs have done an absolutely terrific job on the UI imho. There are definitely times where I've been stuck on what to do next and had to google a solution like how the hell do you convert villagers to monks but the answers are out there and over time I'm hopeful that certain things will become more obvious with in game tips etc. (Monastery needs to have at least one room set to a dormitory before you can add monks by the way). There's not much of a storyline to speak of and it would be interesting to see some proper military combat but all in all, this is a beautiful game to play and is helped with great music  and really nice graphics. I've found it very difficult to stop playing and highly recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing but also very layered experience.	----->	31

95751219	If you're looking for a chill, not too complex, city-builder with charming graphics and soothing music, I'd recommend testing this game. Some features and gameplay may be still a bit counter-intuitive, but I didn't encounter a single bug so far.It's still an Alpha though.	----->	8

95779329	There's a fair bit in the game, but the game very much lacks a sort of end game. It's easily possible to have everything unlocked with only 250 people, at which point, your only drive forward is to have more people, I guess. But it feels pointless when you can have a great economy and 100% happiness without needing to overextend yourself.It also feels like there's some weird implementation. The game doesn't always do a good job of explaining things, and more than a few times I had to go to the subreddit for help figuring out basic things, like that the training dummy (listed as a decoration) is needed to heal and train soldiers, which feels obvious, but when it's marked as decoration, it's a touch odd.Ordinarily, wouldn't recommend a game in this kind of state, but I think you can get a couple runs in currently, and if you're the kind of person to want to make a pretty town, you'll get your money's worth out of it	----->	25

95862897	I have never left a review on Steam before but I think Foundation deserves one. As someone who is not accustomed to city-builders, I was initially a little intimidated to start learning the game but it is incredibly easy to get the hang of. I know for a fact that my first town is not running the most efficiently, but it is still thriving. I played a little before the UI update and this new change is a very welcome update. Foundation is a game that you can pour tons of time into without even realizing it. It has been incredibly relaxing to play. As you progress further into the game, prepare to start setting your own goals and making your own fun. The game has certain milestones and unlocks that set you on your path to building a successful city but after you reach those, growing your city does not always feel as rewarding. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to the new content that the devs release over time!	----->	9

95973367	Of the village building genre, I think this game might lead as my current favorite. The scale and depth of the village grows with the different levels of access to new construction and people jobs/ roles. It does need some better explanation of how to accomplish certain steps and some of the end game requirements are currently impossible for some construction requirements. The trade and inventory system can use a bit of an upgrade in terms of ability to track rates of production/use, or how much is actually being bought or sold. I would like a map overlay of material availability also. Early wealth and land development can be slow.Most of my criticisms are just fine tuning and polishing. The ploppable building style and AI formed roads are very interesting and almost always result in the building of different 'districts' or 'zones' as you expand. The upgrading of housing is satisfying and the levels of buildings are pretty consistently themed to fit together. A few more themes and skins for certain buildings would really allow for a satisfying kingdom building game and I am here for it.	----->	20

95987896	This game was good when I first purchased this and for a short while I really enjoyed playing with friends, but I have a few complaints. 1) The Lobby screen (as of the last time I played this, keep in mind it was during early access so when reading this it might be better) is complicated and unpolished, and just generally hard to look at.2) It has very low replayability, I really only got a few hours out of this every few months, but it just got repetitive and boring after awhile3) This game is near impossible and very boring to play alone, finding public matches takes forever and they generally aren't fun4) The price is way too much (at the time) for the content in the game. If you really want to get this game, get it on the website, instead of 25$ its only 15, but still this game (imo) is only really worth 10$ at most	----->	-1

96059865	For the most part this game isn't that buggy, and the gameplay is a lot of fun. There community maps are kinda a mix on quality. On the one hand, I played some earlier that were escape the room types and they were great, so much fun! And then I just played a set that were HORRIBLY designed and were borderline unplayable at times.Does a great job of showing why game design is both a talent and a skill to be cultivated. Some people have it and some very much do not. But this game, this game is a lot of fun. Stick to the well-rated maps, they are well rated for a reason.	----->	2

96361163	Take Banished, mix it with Anno (I'm thinking 1404), then throw in a little bit of Cities Skylines. From there improve the automation a little bit and you have Foundation. Highly recommend if that sounds up your alley. Even in early access its got more than banished had going on as far as I'm concerned with a similar laid back vibe.I'm excited to see where it goes and what the mods look like, but I know I'll definitely be spending some time in Foundation even as is.	----->	7

96386793	I like the organic building aspect of it, and also that I'm not perpetually forced to focus my attention on combat and contrived, timed distractions. Wish the Monastery was allowed to accept female villagers - I mean really, if they are fine in your army, why not. There were far more female clerics in the middle ages than there ever were soldiers. Wish there was a paving option, more storage in warehouses, and some more tax collectors who showed up earlier.Great  game though. Best city builder to come along in ages. Heartily recommend it, lets you choose your own priorities without forcing you onto some limiting narrative.	----->	5

96479622	If you're looking for a skilled golf game of this type, I'd probably suggest Golf with Friends.But if you want to knock balls around with people who don't ever game online, then maybe get this, because the game is so sporadic in what it does and when it does it, that it's a great leveller for those who are less experienced.Smack the ball full pelt... Maybe it moves, maybe it doesn't!  The inconsistency is this game's biggest failing. There's no way to know beforehand how the ball will react. This means that it's great for drunken free-for-alls (especially when collision is turned on) but not so great if you're looking for a serious game of skill, because the shots differ MASSIVELY in how they react.Big dumb fun, but can be frustrating.	----->	4

96680067	The latest update has clearly resolved many of the random crashes brought on by large villager populations.However there is now a disconnect between what villages need and the information supplied.The villager card used to display what that villager was planning to do next, used to display what food types it preferred.I feel that now a villager goes to a market place to buy some food, rather than berries and wont go to the nearest market with berries, but rather goes to the nearest market and starves if there is no food to buy. These changes obviously massively reduce pathing load on the cpu and yes random crashes at the +1200 villagers on my rig are now far less common. However I am not sure this was the way to go. I see from the crash report that you are monitoring cycle times, so surly the better plan would have been to turn off the new villager supply as cpu resources became stretched.	----->	0

96788053	I am a grown adult. A full time business owner. Yet, I stumbled upon this game last year and I just love playing this game. Ever since I was a child, I loved everything medieval. The architecture and the overall fantasy of the medieval world is fascinating to me. This is one of the rarest of all medieval building games that captures my imagination of anything medieval. I do like that it doesn't have any battles that you command. The medieval world was actually all about land building and producing goods to make profits and making money. It was all business but business was a way for a kingdom to finance its stability and money allowed a kingdom to thrive. I do like the new UI. Also, never promote dozens of serfs at once. It will destroy your happiness right away. I wish gold ore could turn into gold coins rather than trade. I also wish there was the ability for villagers to make children so the population grows. Overall, I recommend this game. Love it love it love it!	----->	25

96943256	This is a fantastic game that I would highly recommend to people who like playing smaller scale city builders. This game touches on a lot of things that I've been missing from other games. There is a lot more freedom without the silly tile based mechanics and the pure amount of buildings and content. At first I though I would be overwhelmed by the complexity of production and the economy and trade but thankfully the devs considered people like me who have a hard time learning new games to make the tutorial very simple and easy to understand and go through.	----->	9

I really appreciated the 'organic' and 'natural' way that the game handles housing and road development - often resulting in cities with asymmetrical neighborhoods and interesting road systems based on what is the easiest path from points A to B. I always feel that hyper-symmetrical housing and road systems (especially in historical settings) seem phony so Foundation has been a breath of fresh air in the 'aesthetic immersion' category. Foundation is certainly on the 'easier' side of city/colony building games. As of now, the negative consequences you face throughout the game are minimal and it's never too difficult to dig yourself out of a hole should you find yourself lacking in crucial resources or other means with which to fulfill the needs of your denizens. All unlockables are obtained in a straightforward manner and the biggest contributor to achieving the required goals is time spent playing. This is great for a more casual player but veterans of the genre may find the game a bit too simplistic and/or easy. Given its 'Early Access' status, the full-price of the Foundation is steep but I think the game is a terrific value when on sale for ~$20 USD or so. If the development team expands on the trading system, adds more weather/seasons variety, and increases randomized events with (with greater consequences), I think the game will be totally worth the full-price. I'm looking forward to what comes down the development pipeline for this game and to updating this review accordingly.	----->	29

97001849	Fun little city builder. Overall it's pretty great, my main request is that the maps get larger, as they are pretty small all things considered. I want more buffer zone between my city and the edge of the playable area. I don't want to build a city right next to the abyss of nothingness.	----->	4

97014370	Foundation is a great game! Although I don't have that many hours put into game time yet I have already fallen in love. Foundation is a medieval city building game with the main focus being driving up population size, building construction , and balancing economy. Although at the surface it might seem like simple little game there are a good amount of unique features that distinguish this game from most. This game now is enjoyable and extremely playable to anyone who loves city building and town management games. My only con with this game is how repetitive it can get there doesn't seem to be to many building options or variations. Although I'm sure that can be fixed with a couple mods! Overall a great game to relax too if you like city builders.	----->	11

DLC for micro transactions just to keep the game fresh.  customizing your ball is also strangely satisfying as you pic your color trail and hats.  Yes, HATS lol.  Enjoy!	----->	4

I like that you don't have to micromanage as much as you had to do in Banished, you have so much more choices in your building your manors and churches. It is an easy game to get into, but challenging enough to keep playing. I actually find this game quite addicting. Though i usually turn off game music in favor of the kind of music i like, i actually find the music in this game relaxing and pretty. I also like the sounds in general.	----->	17

98065761	If you love city builders, definitely try this one out.  It has lots of buildings and a nice progression system.

Straight up 11 hours of gameplay in one sitting without even realizing that there's another life going on outside of the screen. This game will capture that something which makes you disconnect completely from reality for a while. A solid 9/10 game.

98218010	I only have like 3 hours in this game so I might update this review.It's super fun, I like how you can build your own castle, church etc and I just like the whole system of the small village that grows to a huge medieval city. There is a few things I'm struggling with, however:- No more quests: after a few introduction quests, the game just kinda lets you to do whatever you want and figure things out on your own, which would be fine but I find it quite challenging to progress without quest rewards, especially because the money limit is 500 gold, while buying a new land is also 500 gold. Whenever I want to buy another land I have to wait out the moment when I have exactly 500 gold (note that it's always changing) and click really fast or I have to keep waiting. - Nothing really happens after the first quests: you're progressing on your own, and occasionally some random dude shows up and says you have to donate this (resources), and if you do so, you'll get influence points (or something like that) which can be spent for upgrades. It would be alrgiht if it happened more often, however, the dude in my game usually wants fish, and bruh I don't even produce fish yet. Plot twist, to produce fish, you need to have enough influence points which you get from donating stuff, but HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET INFLUENCE POINTS TO BUY THE FISHING OPTION WHEN THE DUDE ALWAYS ASKS FOR FISH? Smh.- Buying and building things feel kinda expensive in consideration you literally have to do everything on your own, without a quest reward system to at least help you out in the first few hours. Note that after the first hour, you will have to build at least 3 different building to produce what you want (for example wheat --> dough --> bread), and as you can't produce a specific type of resource (which is needed for almost every building) without like 4 builldings and a mineral mine (which is rare to find), you will need to buy it from trading. But how am I supposed to have all this money, especially when the limit is 500? (There might be a way to expand this, but if there is, the game doesn't show you. I'll read through the tutorial next time I'm playing I swear.)Apart from these things, I enjoy playing it and I do recommend buying it, although maybe wait for future updates as it's still in development.	----->	28
98224188	The design feature of selected structures, like churches and mansions, allow for some very creative villages. The design is good, with very distinct models that stand out, and makes even small towns look and feel active and lively. The organic growth of houses also makes the towns feel very real and, well, organic, as opposed to the grid patterns many other city builders can end up following.	----->	8
98224773	Nice Casual game to play and just chill out too once you get in that rut where you dont know what game to play since they all seem boring at the moment or you just dont have to drive to play games. Yeah there is some wonky parts once you initially start to get over 100 villagers and the resource management not making much sense at first but after a couple of tries it starts to make sense and is some fun. Have a village with +800 villagers at the moment and honestly just want more building and decorations so that i can make it look better.	----->	-2

98283312	[b]Golf It![/b]Quite a good game in my opinion. I don't have much to say about it because this is just another game about mini golf, but it is differnt from other because there is big amount of maps made by community which are very interesting to play with friends.[hr][/hr][b]Gameplay[/b]I don't have much to say on the topic of gameplay, this is an ordinary game on the topic of mini golf that you can play with friends in your free time. The only goal is to put the ball in the hole with as few strokes as possible. This sounds boring and easy however if you play this game with friends on one of the maps made by the community this game becomes very interesting.[hr][/hr][b]Quality[/b]---{ Graphics }---☐ You forget what reality is☐ Beautiful☐ Good☑ Decent☐ Bad☐ Don‘t look too long at it☐ MS-DOS---{ Gameplay }---☐ Very good☑ Good☐ It's just gameplay☐ Mehh☐ Watch paint dry instead☐ Just don't---{ Audio }---☐ Eargasm☐ Very good☑ Good☐ Not too bad☐ Bad☐ I'm now deaf---{ Audience }---☑ Kids☑ Teens☑ Adults☐ Grandma---{ PC Requirements }---☐ Check if you can run paint☑ Potato☐ Decent☐ Fast☐ Rich boi☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer---{ Difficulty }---☐ Just press 'W'☑ Easy☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master☐ Significant brain usage☐ Difficult☐ Dark Souls---{ Grind }---☑ Nothing to grind☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks☐ Isn't necessary to progress☐ Average grind level☐ Too much grind☐ You'll need a second live for grinding---{ Story }---☑ No Story☐ Some lore☐ Average☐ Good☐ Lovely☐ It'll replace your life---{ Game Time }---☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee☐ Short☐ Average☐ Long☑ To infinity and beyond---{ Price }---☐ It's free!☐ Worth the price☑ If it's on sale☐ If u have some spare money left☐ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your money---{ Bugs }---☑ Never heard of☐ Minor bugs☐ Can get annoying☐ ARK: Survival Evolved☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs---{ ? / 10 }---☐ 1☐ 2☐ 3☐ 4☐ 5☐ 6☑ 7☐ 8☐ 9☐ 10[hr][/hr][b]Important[/b]I recommend that you play this game exclusively with friends because while playing it alone it becomes very boring.[hr][/hr][b]Conclusion[/b]All in all, a great game, but there are always a couple of problems, the biggest of which is the price.

98288984	I bought this yonks ago because it appealed to my city builder/ simulation type preferences.You have to satisfy the needs of your local population to grow areas and learn the distancesto meet those needs.Commerce/ trade is a thing to progress to make money.Feeding people is a thing.Employing people is a thing.Sheltering people is a thing.Expanding land (quests) is a thing.This is a definite try for any city builder/ simulator / leadership/ political /economics type brain person.Graphics are charming, game speeds might annoy those who expect a sky scraper in a day.	----->	0

98476650	I've put over 175 hours into this game so far.I can say it's easily one of my favorite games and has everything I'm looking for in a city builder, and the art style is just the right level of cartoony for my tastes. I much prefer the look of this game to games like Banished or Patron. I also LOVE the fact that it's not on a grid. It's no fun to build roads on a grid system and the winding roads the emerge naturally in this game are beautiful. I wish I could live in the the peaceful land I've created. Oh, to travel to the shrine behind the monastery, drink the wine in the tavern, worship in the sacred grove (i recommend the pagan monuments mod) or live amongs the forest folk! (another amazing mod)I just find it so relaxing.And it's very hard to stop playing, in the best way. If you are looking for a game to dedicate a weekend of freetime to - this will certainly keep you occupied and in good vibes. There are many wonderful mods out already that I think greatly improve the game for both aesthetics and function. I'm very excited to continue playing Foundation and see how the game progresses with updates and hopefully a thriving mod community.	----->	31

98519864	It's a fun game so far, but it can be a bit hard to understand what is going on. Especially the economy of this game, which basically determines whether or not you can do anything at all, is so incredibly vague. I think there should be a lot more detail with regards to the cost of buildings, citizens and whatnot.One simple example is me buying a new territory. I bought my third hexagon, which would cost me 25 coins in upkeep. How come my previously green economy suddenly hit -47 coins? It's frustrating how the economic system functions (or doesn't, really), because everything else about this game is so beautiful and it's a really relaxing experience. The community tab on Steam displays people building amazing worlds, clearly showcasing how cool this game can be.  I'm absolutely positive things will get even better though, but this is just my two cents.	----->	14

98539072	good and relaxing game. please developed more regarding interaction between other kingdom or perhaps we can develop into our own kingdom and became a king itself. Another thing to consider can the developer add multi selection tool compared to the need to select one by one such as selecting soldier to do quest.Update - 1.9The game became more difficult surely but it is manageable. You can try and error to find the best game-play to suit yourself.	----->	4

98544647	Minion Masters is a free-to-play strategic minion brawler from Danish developer Betadwarf. Minion Masters offers players one verse one or two verse two competition taking place in small arenas. Players choose between different Masters with unique hero abilities. They then use these masters to summon collectible minions to the field. Once they’re on the field, it’s pretty much up to them what they’re going to do, so choose carefully.Minion Masters offers several modes, standard one verse one and two verse two, one verse one draft, mayhem, expeditions, and solo challenges. In one verse one draft, players build their deck from a random selection of cards. During this mode, three loses means the player is out of the game. Mayhem offers different rules every week. Expeditions are the game’s story mode. And solo challenges allow players to practice against the game’s AI.To progress in the game, players will need to learn how to utilize their masters as well as unlock or craft an increasing number of minions and spells.Minion Masters promises nearly constant new content, with the developers adding new things all the time, including events and cosmetics. Minion Masters taps into an unused format seen in free to play titles, let alone gaming itself. A combination of charming characters, visually appealing graphics and an addictive progression system weave together to present a game you won’t want to miss.	----->	10

98554436	Despite the fact that this game is still in early access stage, it is already a -somewhat- leading example in the genre.This game introduced a brand new approach to city building; gridless and pathless building. Autonomy at its best. It still encourages micro management, like caring for your peasants' work and home area correlation, commute time and time to be spent on their needs while keeping the traditional work chain approach intact.Even at this stage, especially after the magnificent UI upgrade, this game is providing way too much than any other game in the market right now. Modular building provides a wealth of freedom to the users, slightly hiding the upgrades behind sensible milestones, which also guides players on how an efficient town would expand into and how long it is -roughly- supposed to take.If the updates frequency on this game start getting shorter and the development speeds up, i believe Foundation will not have any significant rivals within the genre.	----->	10

You can also create your own maps to play with your friends and also publish on the workshop if you want others to play it! This game is alot of fun, i don't know why it's still in early access. Though, some achievement are almost impossible (1000 hole in ones, 500 wins). There are some maps to help you but for some you'll need a friend to farm them with you.	----->	6

98776270	The game is enjoyable. I had fun playing while I actually could, but there's a problem with the game. Each time I close the game it doesn't close properly, and next time I try to open the game it says it's already running and does not open. I can't close it manually in Steam, I can't uninstall it and reinstall it. I verified the game files and that didn't help either. I've probably only played about an hour and a half but it says I've played 50 because it keeps running and I can't close it. Anyone else having this problem?Outside of this issue, which can be fixed (thanks commenter!), the game is very fun. Great way to kill some time and to build a medieval settlement. I love city building/simulation/tycoon type games and this one is very fun! Recommend.	----->	4

I dont still understand how and why those a supposed to be played out...	----->	5
98817113	This game is definitely fun to pick up and play. It's goes from a fun challenge to a higher planned infrastructure. This game has incredible potential and it's worth throwing in some time to help push it in the right direction!I would think the following additions to this game would make it even better:1. Improve the AI - sometimes i'll set up a lumber camp and the AI will go to the village center halfway across the map2. More Village Centers - after a certain population, reward with a village center. This will allow players to build multiple castle zones with the AI having better localization3. War on the Map - send in armies to attack our civilization (potential game mode) 4. Speed Building with more Builders - Building can seem a bit slow and the speed at which it builds should be scaled higher based on more builders actively on it hammering awayI apologize if the are already available in mods, but they do feel like they should naturally be baseline.	----->	17

98834727	I try to avoid early access games as I tend to find I lose interest long before the developers ever actually finish their games, but I was drawn into the reviews of this little gem and broke my rule.As a gamer of a certain age, I can still recall the pleasure of the earliest Settlers series of games. That relaxing but enthralling feeling of watching my guys go about their simple little lives. This game brings back those memories in spades. I've no idea where this game will end up, but already there's enough here to spend hours and hours of gentle enjoyment with - and i'm sure as new things are added over time I'll keep coming back again and again.I don't do reviews either, but felt I wanted to give this game the plug it deserves. If you like creative, enthralling little games that conjure up memories of a by-gone age of gaming then buy this. You absolutely won't regret it.	----->	3
98838009	This game is amazing! Everything you would wish for in a Midevil Building game. Sure there isn't multiplayer, but you have mods to keep the excitement up! And best of all, YOU CAN ZOOM IN AND SEE THE AMAZING DETAILS. LOVE THE GAME, 100/10 A++++!	----->	7

98923394	I am a huge Fan of the Settlers franchise for over 30 years now >....< This cuts down a lot of the Settlers 7 Dramatic mechanics Vs mode but instead lets you explore the city building that Foundation's gameplay loops are more about logistics deep down, Making sure newcomers find jobs with homes and Homes with markets and markets with goods. it's a good game for learning micromanagement and understanding how process works.	----->	3

99039733	For years I have been looking for a medieval city building game similar to Knights & Merchants. This is pretty much exactly what I wanted. Building your town takes time, patience and careful planning. Expand too quickly and needs won't be met, but you will run out of room if you are not constantly improving. Be careful about starting too many build projects at once. Certain resources can be scarce until you can produce them yourself. There is no in game combat, but you train troops to send on missions for some pretty lucrative rewards.	----->	5

99054683	I'll start out by saying that SpyParty is a great game, and I am a huge fan of the whole concept. It's unique, it's fun, and it's a great social deduction experience for two people. It's not too simple, it's not too complex, and the rounds tend to last just long enough. Based on the gameplay alone, I would wholeheartedly recommend SpyParty. So why do I not recommend this game? First, a brief bit of context: a friend of mine showed me this game years ago, around 2013. So I bought it, way back in the beta, and the two of us played it regularly and had a blast. That friend moved away around 2015 and we lost contact. Why am I telling you this? Well, guess what I haven't been able to do ever since my friend moved away in 2015? Play SpyParty. My played time speaks for itself. In the past 6 years, I have managed to play TWO ROUNDS of SpyParty (both on the same day). There's just straight up not enough people to play with. And the reason there's no one to play with is pretty obvious, and people have been saying it in reviews ever since the game was first brought to Steam: This game is just too damn expensive for what it is. You're paying $25 for a game with 16 peak players in the past month. $25 for a game, that if you want to play with your friends, will cost [i]them[/i] $25. This game has never gone on sale. There's no kind of deal for buying more than one copy. It's never included in any promotions. Nothing. And it's not even because the developer abandoned the game! They posted an update on the game 11 hours before I made this review.SpyParty is one of the biggest missed opportunities I've ever seen in gaming. This game has the potential to be insanely popular, but the $25 cost per person just completely cripples the game. You simply cannot gate off a social deduction game like this and expect it to succeed. It just does not work. It [i]astounds[/i] me the amount of potential that is just being left on the table here, solely because the developer insists on charging $25 for a game that's been in beta for nearly a decade.So should you spend $25 on SpyParty? Depends. If you have a friend that's willing to also spend $25 on a copy and play with you, the game's a blast! But if you're looking to buy a single copy of this game, and play by yourself, don't bother. There is no one online to play with you.	----->	9

99085518	The physics, particularly the contact of putter to golf ball, are atrocious. The concept of hitting the ball with actual speed of cursor movement is good in theory but it was implemented terribly. It's incredibly inconsistent and cannot be relied upon at all. This is the type of game you play while high out of your mind. Playing it while sober makes you want to delete the entirety of Steam off your computer, not just uninstall the game. I've noticed that there is very little middle ground with your shots. It's either way too light or way too hard, no in between. Pull and release solves this.Also, for any developers reading this, there's a bit of a bug with the strokes system. If you stroke out in public games with the default stroke limit it will always stop you at 12, but will most of the time give you 14 strokes on the scoreboard. Is this some weird golf rule or just an error in the code?The default level designs are awesome and the fact that there is a level editor is very cool too, but the cursor speed system is just far too finicky to be plausible in a game like this. Stick to pull and release.	----->	6

Custom items can be won after completing matches to gear out your golf ball and customize with your fav color. They even have skins! Play with your buds or play solo against random noobs online.

99718780	This game is super fun and super silly with friends, it's plentiful alive with public lobbies open around the clock. The game was dropped and never finished so expect some bugs. I do not recommend buying at full price but it does go on sale for $5 sometimes and that's worth it in my opinion. The best part is, it runs fairly well without a graphics card. Using UHD on medium to low 1080p settings with anti-lashing will give you 35-50 fps depending on the amount of water textures, just allow some time for your cpu and ram to render the map before putting or you may get a couple frame skips. To do that, just hover your mouse around and look at the scenery for a second, then begin to put!Have fun!	----->	18

First of all this is early access so despite any positive feedback I have about this game this is still unfinished product and it feels like it. Gameplaywise it's basically anno x settlers but with a twist. There are no grids limitting your area for construction. You can even combine buildings into something new and it would still  work. Villagers decide on their own which way they should go to reach their workplaces and homes so you can ignore this aspect of game and just build. I spend most of my time decorating houses, making tidy gardens and fencing properties from eachother. It's a lot of fun but what about challanges? There are currently 4 levels of settlers starting with newcomers who only need food and water and ending with citizens who have wide variety of needs  such as golden trinkets or good meal at the tavern. There are no wars in your lands aside from those you can participate abroad but they are waged off-camera, one of the few events that still require further development. At this point game is very pleasant city-builder although your experience at some point mainly depends on your own imagination. If you lack some plan on your mind to expand your city you will quickly lose interest because there are not many obstacles to face. Still - a great game and I recommend to buy it when on sale	----->	15

99799447	It's worth it. I bought the game, enjoyed what's there, and look forward to more. I’ve always wanted a city-building game that was able to focus down into each of the jobs that needed doing. The developers have some great ideas and are putting them into action.Pros:Verge of greatness job system. Lovely aesthetics. Nice music. Simple resources. Modular building system. Assignable building parts. Paint residential areas that auto-build. Reforesting. Can't really deplete resources. Villager work/need fulfillment/pathing is decent! Can see where building access is. Can see workplace, home, and location of villager. Immigration for more villagers. Functional villager/workplace/soldier/trade lists. Increasing max treasury by expanding manor is awesome. Blueprints to find monuments - meh; blueprints to find other versions of buildings - yes please! Monuments for game progress, achievements, and large building projects. Desperately needs economies of scale; this is why I'm excited for new content.Cons:Building maintenance is awful. Expanding is expensive. Market income is too important. Builders will walk across the map instead of being assigned to nearby projects. Can't have multiple builders on a single building. Military expeditions are way overpowered. Trade is weak; can't buy some things, can't sell others. Not enough building window options, which would be a good use for glass. Roofs would pool rain so bad. Doors end up underground or do not meet terrain in a visually appealing way. Can't use different building materials for same building (would be nice to have wood, stone, marble as building tiers). No way to level/change terrain. Shouldn't have to paint resource extraction. Lots of building parts have no use. Way too difficult to find/get to minerals. Can't promote villagers from their selection window. The ranks don't matter. No option to auto-assign villagers to open jobs. No easy way to phase out a workplace. Reassigning storage destroys inventory. UI does not show max storage amounts. No unrest. Only emergency is bad weather. (Where is fire risk?)Some other ideas are:Seasons, husbandry, hand-carts, paths vs. roads, firewood/warmth, an interconnected world map, [b][i]multiplayer[/i][/b], warfare, raids, and/or skirmishes.Overall, mid- and late-game have a lot of room to expand on an already strong core. The game is moddable, and there are some that would be good official additions to the game.	----->	11

99826217	I love this game. The art style is amazing, and I love watching the city grow. Things I hope they improve; more maps. Roads, the paths are formed autonomously by your citizens, and it's really fun and challenging but I wish you could somehow make paths dissapear after they're formed if you wanted it moves.9/10	----->	13
99833686	Очень приятная реализация на тему городостраительства в средневиковье. Несколько продуктовых цепочек, три короткие ветки развития, незамысловатые квесты. То что нужно под пивко в пятницу вечером =)  	----->	0

99859203	Really fun mini golf game, you aim by moving the mouse and clicking to lock and then swing by moving your mouse from down up so skill matters a lot. There are community maps on steam workshop so replayability is huge! Multiplayer still needs some polishing (sometimes players get occasional bugs), sometimes you get kicked cause people just want to start the game so some times you can get on a kicking spree before actually joining a game, unless you host. Overall the game is already an awesome experience and I completely recommend it! I haven't tried it in VR though, I'm curious to do it, I'll try to update this review once I do.	----->	13

99979015	Very relaxing little builder. I tried this game again with the updated menus and stuff but I think it went a step backwards. Now it's too crowded for me. I liked the very simplistic style like in Banished. But this game is still in development and the core game play is so much fun so far. I like the custom buildings and such. I would like to custom every house in the village if it was up to me.UPDATE:Okay I have played with the new Interface now more and it's growing on me. I resized it smaller and it has some new quality of life improvements I didn't notice first. So I think it's an improvement now.UPDATE 2: I have completed every masterpiece and had over 500 people in a village without mods and I can edit my review a bit. I think this game is just ...magnificent. Time just flows by when playing and all the micromanagement is so much better now when I realized how to balance my budget better. Only things I kinda want to change is getting gems and gold earlier. I found gold in the last deposit in the map and it bottle necked me quite a bit getting couple of the better masterpieces to get the last trade route open to buy gems. Also my markets were bugged for a while. I had nearby food in store but my market tenders didn't go get it for some reason. Couple of my citizens just left because my markets were empty of food and goods. I had over 2000 bread, 400 cheese and 200 berries in the granaries. Only when I built 5-6 more granaries the market tenders fixed themselves and they worked again. Just please keep improving this game and I hope more people pick this game up because it's one of the best city builders out there.	----->	35
