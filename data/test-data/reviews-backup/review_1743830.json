Fair price for what you get to play, a responsive dev team that get involved in the Steam forums.\n\nNow the game is an early access, so yes there may be bugs (but nothing game breaking at least for me up to now)\nIs the game complete ? nope it's early access, but you at least have a full campain to play with. No sandbox for now.\nThere are also some balancing that needs (and will be) done, devs are aware of and are listening to us.\n\nSo yes, remember it's still early access. But devs seems very pro-active, work their tails off, there is a reasonable roadmap, so no big promises with question marks of when / if it will achieved. It's a reasonable work ahead, and the base of the game is a solid game.\n\nWhat the game is not though : it's not a \"military strategy\" game. You don't control your troops, the combat part is just an off screen with a timer running down until you get the result of your \"military action\". You see nothing of it, etc.\n\nThe game is more a \"city builder\" set as a military camp with crew management, instead of a military game with camp management.\n\nAnyway, if you like complete full games, wait until it's out of early access, but if you want to dive in the game early and get involved with how the game developps, then jump right in.

The Story is a bit, odd, but overall is pretty light-hearted and a comedic tone. Though there are a few things I wish the game did better. \n\n1st: To my knowledge at the time of this review you can no edit or change your solider names. \n2nd: The 2x speed is SO SLOW. Going through 1 in game day on normal speed is bad, but even on the 2x speed it's still slow. I found myself just sitting on idle waiting for 5, 10, 15 up to 30 minutes trying to train my soldiers to get to a certain level. \n3rd: Cash and economy. I'm willing to chalk this up to me not knowing how to play the game at first, but for me I found myself bleeding money trying to build up my army enough so that I didn't have to wait. The game forces your soldiers on a cool down after missions, and if you missing 1 specialization then guess what, your waiting. To combat this you can hire and train more troops, but that also means spending more money. It would be nice if maybe there were some side missions here or there for a cash influx but it's not the cash. \n\nUltimately I really enjoy the game but in it's current build on 3-6-23 it's just WAY TOO SLOW for me to continue. I really hope the devs add in maybe a 3x or 4x speed or just increase the base speed. And please let me change the name of a soldier. \n\nOverall, I'd give the game a solid 7.5 to 8/10 in my opinion.

The foundation for a game is here, but it's definitely lacking.  One Military Camp does a poor job in specializing in a single thing, which is frustrating because it's a [i]fun[/i] game, it's just not as fun as it [i]could[/i] be, mostly because you have little to do.\n\nFirst off the gameplay loop is super simple.  You receive income from holding territories and from completing quests; note that quests are finite - once you complete a quest, you get its reward and move on.  So you can easily find yourself in a situation where you're not making enough money, because your only source of income is holding territories.  This means if you build your base too quickly, although there's no \"maintenance\" costs, you do pay for your buildings passively through maintenance workers (their wages) and supplies (for the buildings as they are used).  Because self-sufficiency is not yet in the game (it's on the road map), your income display is always lying - it leads you to believe you're in the black, generating money, when in fact, helicopters are constantly buying food, ammunition and diesel fuel for your base - and the finances only takes into consideration your territory passive income and your wages.  So you may think you're making 1500 a day, when in fact, you're not, and this spells your doom.\n\nThis causes a gameplay issue because in order to liberate territories, you need to complete the quests therein.  In order to complete the quests, you need soldiers that are specialized in certain areas.  Which means your wages are going to be your highest expenditure as you bloat your army unnecessarily.  Even having just 2 of every specialization can cost you the game, and many quests need 2 of a certain job (probably more as the campaign progresses; I only got as far as the first \"boss\" in my playthrough).  People cannot change jobs laterally or descending, they can only be promoted.  Additionally, you [b]must[/b] fill all of the job roles for a quest, even if filling most roles still gives you a high success rate, which I think is bad design.  I understand the necessity, it's gate-keeping to stop you from progressing too fast, but the game pacing is already insanely slow (probably intentionally due to lack of content).  But it's this gate-keeping that can do you in, because you only have a single source of income.  You'll bleed money (even if your daily income is positive, because again, you're not self-sufficient yet!) and find yourself needing to fire people to stay afloat.  Worse yet, you need an insane number of job roles to keep your base \"flowing.\"  For instance, in my 4 hours of playthrough, my base was not overly large - one of each training building (11, I think, by this point?), houses, barracks, canteen, etc.  But my SIX maintenance workers could not keep up.  I continuously had buildings highlighted in disrepair.  My generators were always begging for more fuel.  My canteen would run out of food during every meal time, because the canteen doesn't restock until it's at 0 food (why??).  Furthermore, there are FIVE hospital buildings, which means you need TEN doctors to keep them \"running\" during day and night.  I didn't bother, I had two, and I would move them around as required - but welcome to micromanagement hell, just to save a buck.  Why they thought five different types of clinics was a great idea, instead of one that specializes in something important and another to do general stuff (I mean, come on, the Flu Clinic and the Sleep Clinic can be the same building: you just need a damn bed) is beyond me.  Anyway the point being made here is that, because there's no self-sufficiency, the gameplay balance is crazy out of whack.  Missions are finite, and your only income are territories.  You send people on missions to unlock territories, but you need different roles for each mission, so you train a variety of soldiers - but now you're spending too much!  Are you expected to fire people and rehire/retrain from the ground up, soldiers you \"don't need?\"  I doubt it, but that's what I needed to do to keep the money coming in, since again, no self-sufficiency.  I feel self-sufficiency should have been in the game before the EA release, because that will seriously help to fix the current major issue of your finances (during the campaign).  Or, throw in repeatable missions.  Just, something to bolster your income.\n\nSince right now the main issue with the game is financial in nature, let me tell you how to game handles bankruptcy: it doesn't.  If you run out of cash, instead of suggesting a loan, or firing some people to bring you into the black - the game pops up a menu saying \"You suck\" (not literally) and ejects you to the menu.  What the heck?  I get it, probably a temporary measure and will get fleshed out, but what a crap experience - let me tell you.  I mean, I did laugh my ass off when it happened, and I just loaded my autosave and made some quick adjustments to prevent going into the negative, but let's hope they put some attention into this end-game state in the future.\n\nLet's touch on gameplay.  You recruit people, train them in buildings, send them on missions (which again, are finite), watch timers, and most of the game is staring at your base and micromanaging your doctors and looking for spies.  You can automate supply deliveries, but that's the only real automation.  Watch towers unlock later to discover \"spies\" in your base, but they only activate if the \"spy\" transforms into their TRUE FORM just before planting a bomb.  It's so silly to watch a spy walk right past a watch tower and not get discovered because they're \"dressed in your uniform.\"  It's also silly that the only people that can react to the alarm are the watch tower guards: I mean, I have snipers and militiamen walking around, and they just... don't care?  Is this a military base of a comedy festival?  So that's the game, in a nutshell.  You stare at your base, reassigning doctors, watching for spies, while your people train their stats to become better soldiers to do the next mission, all while seeing your income says positive but your money keeps going down because reasons.\n\nSpeaking of money, avoid decorations.  They cost an insane amount of money for what they offer (which is nothing).  Why is a statue 6,000?\n\nBy the way, the recruitment pool is always low-stat losers, because the towns you liberate send you people that have different [i]traits[/i] rather than better stats.  The game is so slow paced (even on the maximum speed of 2) that training people to replace your attrition is a chore: and again, you can't have backups of roles, because they cost a salary every day, and you have no proper income right now.  So the game is presently one big slog.\n\nI know, I've only written gripes; it's difficult to tell you about the good things in the game when I'm so focused on everything I didn't like.  But, I recommend the game, because you know what?  What was there, it was FUN.  That's what matters.  Everything I've complained about?  Fixable, if that's their design ambition, which means in the future One Military Camp may shape-up to be a great little game!  Some things probably won't be fixed (Like the need for 5 clinics, I assume that's a keeper), but I can still dream.  I'm hopeful to see the sandbox mode and what that would look like, and I'd really like to see you \"do more.\"  Sending people on missions to watch a timer, been there, done that.  Staring at your base to find spies gets old quick.

It could be too much for some. I personally love it, as I am also a big Management fan. And I think they do a good job of giving you lots of tools to help 'manage the management' with lists, filters, and assignment indicators.\n\nBut really, just some COOL stuff. Great detail in each building and in the interaction of characters and environment. Some objects like light-posts and power poles operate on a totally different grid than the buildings, allowing for particular design. I love the level of zoom from close-up straight out to the overworld. Nice 360, appropriate quality graphics for the style of game.

Everything functions, looks good, and plays fairly smoothly (although I did have to tinker with FPS just a little when starting). There are still two areas that need improvement, however, the first being the lack of things to do as your camp is just starting out. There's just not really that much to do while you're waiting for troops to be trained. Later that seems to change, but it's still very tedious. This could be fixed either by an even faster maximum game speed or introduction of increased customization or other time filler elements at the beginning of the game.\n\nThe other, more significant problem with the game is that it lacks the character of Evil Genius. It's clear they're going for the same irreverent tone, all the way from the character designs to the music choices that are just different enough to avoid lawsuits (I know the Great Escape theme when I hear it on the intro menu). The issue is more intangible, in that it's hard to feel the same love for the material in this that you get from Evil Genius. The characters are all very one-note rather than clever subversion like in Evil Genius. Also notably absent is the suggestion that anyone could possibly die, which is pretty odd for a military tycoon game. The villains look like those that you see in the horrendous Clash of Clan ads that keep popping up for me in Youtube. It just makes me feel like they're about to ask for my credit card information at any moment. \n\nThey don't do that though, at least not yet. That's why I recommend it. It's fun, in a lazy Sunday kind of way. I bet kids would have a fun time with it, especially if it's their first tycoon game ever.  I'd say ages 6-12 would be a good age range for this. I would have loved the hell out of it myself at that age. I've been working my way steadily though the campaign and it hasn't really learned any true laughs or edge of my seat moments, but it's been nice to relax with.

I just want to point a few things about the game and address the top negative review. The game does have some little quarks, but nothing game breaking or that I would think even should constitute a negative review. My primary gripe with a game that challenges you to optimize your base, at the same time does not allow you to swap job positions. This was purposefully done from what I can ascertain as I mentioned this in a community thread and received a response from the dev. I can see the purpose in this. But in reality, any employer can change the position of an employee. In my opinion, this is a major area of the game that needs a slight bit of polish. I think most players are in agreement that they would like to see that feature implemented. \n\nNow as far as the negative review. They called the game \"extremely\" linear which I'm going to argue is at the very least over the top and an extreme critique. It is linear as far as a story campaign, but it offers some forks in the road and allows you to choose along which path you are going to proceed. It branches off in different directions once you get past the initial phase of setting up your base. The other reason this is a bad critique is because as soon as you open the New Game tab, you can clearly see that there is a sandbox mode in development. As I mentioned in my original review, there is plenty to do and keep your eye on in the main campaign. And I even think that there is a little bit of replay value as you are without a doubt going to identify things that you could do better or perhaps just differently. I saw a lot of likes on this review, so I thought that it is worth pointing out not that I'm meaning any disrespect to their opinion about the game. I have no dog in this fight. I'm just a fellow gamer. \n\nOriginal Post:\n\nI'm really enjoying this game so far. I saw Raptor play it yesterday and it drew my attention as it adds a very unique dimension to the base building/city management genre. It does well at what it represents. I don't think I have played a game where you develop and hone a military base in such a way. The script coupled with the cartoonic graphics provides good humor, but don't be fooled - this is still a thinking game. There is also already plenty in the game for design and optimization even though they are prefab, they are some of the best prefab you will see. I don't mind the prefab in this game because that is typical of military encampments. The primary concern of a military base is not posh architectural arrangements with some exceptions which the game very well accounts for, such as statues and entertainment venues for the troops. Even in the early stages of development, you will find plenty to keep your eye on. Below I will outline the pros and cons for easy reading.\n\nPROS:\n1. The UI is clean and intuitive \n2. Management depth\n3. Though presented in a lighthearted way, still provides plenty of realism\n4. Characters with a lot relative personality traits so that it's diverse but not overloaded\n5. System requirements are minimal\n6. Tutorial and story mesh well\n\nCONS:\n1. The only con that I can mention at this time is that I couldn't officially swap staff positions. You can move them around, but they will keep the tag of the original position hired for. \n\nMiscellaneous: \n1. There is a sandbox mode in development. Right now there is only the main campaign. But there seems to be plenty in the campaign already that you will enjoy the game plenty while knowing that sandbox is on the way improving the replay value of the game. This is not a half done early release. It just gives the players the opportunity to start playing the game as it continues to develop from its foundation which is the point of early access.

This year has been amazing for strategy game enthusiasts, and One Military Camp stands out as one of the 10 best. I've been following this game since its earlier betas, and I've always loved how it distinguishes itself from other games in the genre. The game's progressive difficulty is well-balanced, and the content is rich, providing players a campaign with probably more than 30 hours of gameplay.\nThe graphics are cool and clean, the attention to detail is impressive. The animations are fluid and smooth, adding a level of immersion that's hard to find in other games. The tutorial is perfect for beginners, but if you have played it previously you can always skip it. I love that they don't force you to do it.\n\nI am a discord community member and I was amazed with the game's focus on community feedback. The developers have been listening closely to what players want, and they've been implementing changes and updates based on that feedback, in addition to keeping a healthy community. I'm really looking forward to the upcoming sandbox mode and challenges.\nOverall, One Military Camp is a game that any strategy game enthusiast should try out.

The dialogue is really hilarious, and it really sets the tone of the storytelling. I found all the infraestructures, paths and even energy source management really complex and interesting, this paired with the characters having their own stats and perks, and also the investigation tree, gives the game much more depth than what I was expecting.\n\nThe game surely lives up to the resource management genre and I think it got to a great start, so I really recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1677779422, "timestamp_updated": 1677779422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709520459175109863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133927533": {"recommendationid": "133927533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060744963", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 747, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1678558666}, "language": "english", "review": "Only played this game for 15 minutes and loving it.
