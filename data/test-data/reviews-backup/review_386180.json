Even though it is a free to play game it is possible to earn the in game money without buying the money with real money (it is still an option though), gain your resources through PVP or the fuel guzzling PVE raid mode (Your fuel refills at the start of each day.), or the free roaming story based pve mode Awakening as well as other modes. Selling your resources on the market is an option and can give you a lot or a little cash back depending on the player driven market value (Player driven markets I don't care for.) or you can save your junk and build better more effective weapons, modules, or cosmetics with them via the workbenches provided by one of the 7 factions you will interact with (Getting your reputation points up with each faction gets you WAY better armor parts to use with your builds as well.). PVP is VERY competitive but still fun, you never know what will happen, will you be missing half your wheels or be disarmed or will you do the un-wheeling or dis-arming? Anyway, PVE Raids vary in difficulty depending on what you want to try and if your build's power score will allow you to enter the match, a multi-objective based mission in the raids keep you on your toes and you get to fight a boss at the end of each raid. Personally, Crossout is both a fun game for crafting and creating the most odd looking vehicle imaginable, and frustrating for it's competitive PVP and sometimes hard PVE raids but I love it all the same and I do recommend everyone at least try it once, it is free after all.\n\nThis is Murlin The Great signing off, see you on the battlefield!", "timestamp_created": 1575797715, "timestamp_updated": 1575797715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "59465133": {"recommendationid": "59465133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169514003", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1418, "last_played": 1653697041}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1575773388, "timestamp_updated": 1575773388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58965672": {"recommendationid": "58965672", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990467234", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 45449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39105, "last_played": 1619394758}, "language": "english", "review": "Crossout has some how managed to eat up a LOT of my time... and frankly i do find it a fun game- however i feel that the way the game is laid out and how it flows causes a lot of new players some frusterations.

Well.. It's not, literally the only thing in the entire game you can't get only by playing are some avatars BUT don't think you can have everything unlocked from the first minute playing, the grind is quite tedious, specially if you are a new player, it gets easier the more you progress since you will have acces to better gear and seassons which reward you with a lot of resources. \n\nNote that this game doesn't tell you a lot of how it works, so take a bit of time to learn the mechanics is mandatory, one example that new players struggle a lot with is with the workbenches..  So, as you advance and get more reputation you can unlock new factions and new workbenches to craft better gear,  the workbenches are rented with coins, which are the \"premium\" currency you'll see in other games, the difference is that here you DON'T need to buy them with real money, coins are obtainable by selling stuff, you have to follow the patron: \n\nPlay games > get resources > craft some basic stuff > play more games > sell resources > get coins > rent workbench > craft better gear > play more games > get more resources >  get better gear \n\nAt one point you will be able to do medium and hard seassons, which will give you scrap, wires and electronics to craft or sell, when you reach to this point, you will have a pretty stable coin income.\n\nIt's also important to learn how the market works so you get some profit from the items you sell (sell high, buy low) that can take a bit to get used to.\n\nAs for equipment balance, keep in mind that every literal single thing in the game has it's counter, and most of them more than one, but that's a matter of test and error, since every player has different tactics or playstyle, you will have to experiment a lot until you find your sweet spot.\n\nWell, if you reached to this point and want to avoid the text wall here is a quick sum up: \nThis game is hard for begginers, but once you get used to the mechanics, the market, and the resource management you can have a really great time, specially if you find some friends to play with.  \n\nAlso, the game is free and it doesn't take alot of space, so the typical \"well it's free, just give it a try and decide for yourself\" is on point :P \nHave fun!", "timestamp_created": 1518263625, "timestamp_updated": 1518263625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501836121082305908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38936744": {"recommendationid": "38936744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163519462", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 203339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41186, "last_played": 1630660045}, "language": "english", "review": "extremely good base idea perfected by a realistic touch,it goes without saying executing such idea will be burdensome,especially in balancing & giving value to each part & item.\ngaijin managed these,yet failed to create a reliable matchmaking system,work must be done here but if a solid completion occures paying to progress faster is completely acceptable considering theres a slower but free option also.", "timestamp_created": 1514815065, "timestamp_updated": 1514815065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51361006498336792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38219706": {"recommendationid": "38219706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046571606", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 1894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1894, "last_played": 1553807518}, "language": "english", "review": "i think a sandbox will fit this game good. it would not be that hard to add it in.", "timestamp_created": 1512936075, "timestamp_updated": 1512940965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38035300": {"recommendationid": "38035300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027405837", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 48851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15256, "last_played": 1634853273}, "language": "english", "review": "Back when I first played in closed beta the game was very unbalanced and weapons and other needed items were nearly un obtainable unlss you were super rich.

I think I'm ready to write a review about this game, but most people won't like it.\n\nOveral, I highly suggest this game to everyone! Yes the game is a huge grind even if You are so called p2w player.\n\nThere is no such thing as drone/turrets etc. problem, if You learn how to counter them. Most people who complain about this issue are Canon players who can't aim.\n\nMany people also will say that Hover builds have way too much armor, but they don't know what they are talking about. To put it in simple words at 10k+ Power score ground Vehicle easily can have 3000+ structure, where good Hover builds will have only around 1000. But even if people can't counter Hover builds, changes are coming to the parts and fairly soon I guess.\n\nPeople also are saying that weapons like spears are now useless against hover builds, but they might be surprised how effective they can be if mounted high enough to hit hover builds.\n\nReading some reviews I also see that people are saying that after 3k+ PS drones and hover builds are ruling the battlefield. ALL of those people are wrong! as I said I have almost 500 hours in the game and 80% I played missions with 3,5k-4k PS and honestly if it's not for a 4man groups Hovers and drones was never a problem to Me personally!\n\nSo now to my personal review and why I am making it positive!\n\n1. Ranked battles for competitive players! Yes it will take months to grind before You can participate and get in top 100, but it's possible, I personally only recently started to participate, so I would say that for ok player it will take around 400 in game hours before You can do good in Ranked battles.\n\n2. fast matches - PVP match only lasts 3 minutes, so You have to move around instead of camping! Many people still either camp, either suicide!\n\n3. skill to win! Yes many people think that there are a lot of cheaters in this game, but I don't think so! In my around 400 ranked battles so far, I haven't seen even once aimbot or anything from that sort. Yes there have been some lucky shots that got Me killed, but I haven't noticed visible cheating. It really takes skill and a lot of practice to do good in hover builds, specially combined with Tsunami canons!\n\n4. season missions - I completed every season mission since OBT start, it's a great way to earn a lot of crafting materials together with some containers. It used to be every week, now changed to every 2 weeks, means that You really need to spend only 1 hour a day in order to earn in 2 weeks a lot of scrap, wires, enough electronics and on top of that 1 rare and 1 epic part, which can be sold, meaning that around 400 coins every 2 weeks besides selling earned crafting materials.\n\n5. In game market - Market is an awesome feature that can help You if You use it right. Before a major update selling some of Your stuff will benefit You greatly, after new major update drops, quick buy/sell is a thing and can earn You a lot of coins in short amount of time. My quick example would be right after Dawns children update dropped I had 1300 coins on my account, new pack came out and people sold their Icarus hovers. I used that into my advantage and did a quick buy/sell with these hovers in first 2 days I earned over 2000 coins by just buying and selling these hovers.\n\n6. Brawls - Specificly The big black scorpions brawl, where everyone is equal and it all depends on Your personall skill.\nIf You haven't tried it, try it and thank Me later.\n\nOveral Awesome game, still needs a lot of work at end game, simply because there are only 3 good building options currently for it. More works, but to do very good it's either Double Tsunami hover builds, Double Hammerfall builds or Tripple Spark builds.

I can't have an opinion on that since I bought the Closed Beta Test pack and got 2000 coins when I first played Open Beta Test. There is very much a grind, if you want rare parts from the market, and even more so if you want epic parts.\n\nVehicles are built out of parts of varying sizes and you cannot buy more structure pieces, you have to level up in a faction to get more. And instead of CPU/pFlop usage that varies with different cubes, there is a parts limit that maxes out at 80 when you level up in the Engineers faction.\n\nCrafting is interesting, basically you get the required stuff for what you want and then you tell the faction people what you wanna make. If its in a high tech workbench, you need to buy a thing that lets you use it for an amount of time.\n\nHave I mentioned the market? The market is not like the cube shop or cube forge, where prices are set in stone. Instead it is player driven and the prices go up and down. You can make offers and also directly sell the items in their most expensive purchase or buy on the cheapest sale. It also includes fees, so that the market does not inflate and it keeps people buying coins. \nThe more rare or unobtainable an item, the higher the price, even if it is a common item. The more of an item there is, the cheaper it will be. If there is less of an item, you can charge more for people to buy it. If there is more of an item, you can lower the price of it to sell it faster.\n\nTry it yourself to see if you like it, it's free.

After the inital dive it gets grindier and grindier in true gaijin fashion with each successive tech tree requiring you to mash together a pile of parts from the previous tree, which (who would'a guessed it?) requires you to grind the same missions over and over. \n\nI do understand this is still beta and they are working on things but as of right now pvp is almost unplayable in some aspects for newer players.  Older experienced players stack vehicle parts of high rarity and literally drive circles around other players while spamming one shot barrages of missles, cannon fire, and bouts of flame.  That is, when you even get games with other players, most of the time you will play against bots even in pvp matches.  \n\nFor the most part it has the makings of a great game, but as of right now it needs a lot of changes, attention, and work to be polished into something great.[/strike]", "timestamp_created": 1486244828, "timestamp_updated": 1486446236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473257213830947876", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29641776": {"recommendationid": "29641776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055889269", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3499, "last_played": 1645967094}, "language": "english", "review": "Would like to have an way to turn off bots or not.

If u reach it you have to wait a cupple of days for it to reset to get any more (this \"may\" be for pre release only, even so its pointless to play when your at your limit). This makes crafting a little more dificult seeing as how you need Copper, Scrap, Coin and usuly 3 other item with multiples of them to craft 1 item, that is if its not the ones that need the extra wires, electronics, or fragments to make. When crafting items they have a \"build time\" before you actually get it. Nice idea but a little much seeing as how you only get the required material for a win, if its an item you'll only get 1 (if you lose, your lucky to get scrap maby some fuel if your outfitted for it and you dont die). Geting the item you need it will take a few attempts as each mission has random drop chance with 3 displayed items as a higher outcome. As for geting coins haha have fun (Having a player based market is somehing I dont and never will like).\nThe AI needs a little love. Here are some examples that you tens to see in mission matches\n- The AI frendlys will continuisly push you around \n- They tend to get stuck on every thing\n- They will drive past enemy's and not shoot\n- They will rush cap making games even shorter \n- The guns and items they have tend to be to high or to low for your lvl (nothing like being rushed by 3+ bots with cannons on them ;P )\n\nI will say this tho, I am having a lot of fun playing the game even with the flaws. like most beta game needs a lil work. I am use to this as I mostly play alpha and bata games. That being said most of the bug will be fixed for when the game is open, untill then everyday will most likely have mix results. This may mostly be a negative review but I have changed my opinion on the game from a \"don't get\" to a \"must have\". As more things get fixed (balanced etc.) the game will only get better.

Remember what I said about grind: This is what is needed for crafting a 1st level ammo pack:\n2 - Basic 75mm cannons = 300 scrap each to make / 15 from a standard battle = 120 minutes of battling\n2 - Basic Machine guns = 300 scrap each  to make / 15 from a standard battle = 120 minutes of battling\n2 - Basic Shotguns = 300 scrap each  to make / 15 from a standard battle = 120 minutes of battling\n50 copper = approx 7 a game x 3 average minute game time = 21 minutes of just fighting\n450 Scrap (none from the 6 guns we broke down to make this?) = 90minutes\n\nso 7 hours and 51 minutes of game play to make a single 1st level ammo pack, but wait it takes a real time hour to craft (again for some reason unknown to me)\nSo the actual time is 8Hrs and 51 minutes\n\nNow, you can buy stuff from the market, there are daily challenges and seasonal ones to help with the cost, but I would like to ask did 8hrs sound like a good idea in development?\nDid someone grind to make an ammo pack to see what it felt like?\nIf at anytime you decide not to make that item, you will not get 1/10th of the price back it cost you to make or buy those guns if you sell them.\n\nIf you want to hook people for the long haul, add new things into the game, the whole game is about battling and it's fun as heck! Don't go for the cheap hooks like this, ditch the weapon requirement or at least make them make sense and you'd have a great crafting system.\n\nAll in all the crafting is the only thing I really have a problem with now, and I plan on buying what I need from the in game market so if you are a person who does the same I highly recommend this game!\nIf you like making someone wish they had prepared for your triple rocket launcher cloaking sneak attack that removed all their guns and half their armor, then this is also the game for you!\nHappy hunting!", "timestamp_created": 1483595665, "timestamp_updated": 1515190503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29018324": {"recommendationid": "29018324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125163034", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 769, "last_played": 1609802817}, "language": "english", "review": "basically. you can build vehicles and play post apocolyptic bumper cars with them.\nYou can also mount guns on it.\n\nI mounted a 75mm howitzer on the back of a pickup truck.\nmy truck flew backwards a few hundred feet, but i still killed the enemy.\nyeah.\nThis game is super fun, would reccommend it to any grinders, levelers, or people who love building wacky vehicles in games.

Battling rewards you with materials and parts which can be used to create other parts or sell them on a market. The market is very economy based with buying and selling prices. Usually selling parts yields tax which prevents players from exploiting the market. As you level up and build stronger vehicles, you gain affinity with four factions (Engineers, Lunatics, Nomads, and Scavengers). Leveling with these factions allows you to craft stronger parts at crafting benches (which you have to rent out).\n\n[h1]The good.[/h1]\n   As of December 2016, the game costs around $30.00 for closed beta access. As the decription suggests; the game may go free2play next year so I dont recommend buying it at the moment, but it sure will be good when it is free. The graphics card usage and cpu usage is quite low for stronger cpus and gpus. This suggests that you dont need a high-end rig to play it, but you shouldn't play it on a potato. The graphics are decent considering the strength of the gpu needed. Battles themselves can get intense as different player designs yields different play styles. One player may have a melee based vehicle when another player may have a sniper based vehicle. There are a great assortment of weapons. from heavy cannons to explosive javelins, this game has so many weapon variants.\n\n[h1]The bad.[/h1]\n   Sometimes the game may break and you loose progress or your account and you need help from the developers. Just so you know, the support is very bad. The devs refuse to help you and blame it all on you. If you continue to plea, they will keep denying it and give you false facts.

So you can buy new weapons and frames etc. \n\nTHIS GAME IS AWESOME FROM WHAT I'VE PLAYED SO FAR!!", "timestamp_created": 1482727765, "timestamp_updated": 1482727955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567147612571716309", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28652575": {"recommendationid": "28652575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133141931", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1654534085}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1482710821, "timestamp_updated": 1482773199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28643227": {"recommendationid": "28643227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352409805", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 15906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1661029104}, "language": "english", "review": "Really cool game :-)", "timestamp_created": 1482691440, "timestamp_updated": 1482691440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014469861984253", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28610561": {"recommendationid": "28610561", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973738127", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 176, "last_played": 1507602681}, "language": "english", "review": "So much promise!

It's still EA so, at highter level you'll find yourself fighting against vet players who allready have everything unlocked, but still, even with low level parts you can win a game by yourself, it's all about strat and not being caught by the ennemy team at the wrong moment.\n\nI do enjoyed my first 35h of building and fighting with my strange design.\n\nSurprise your ennemy with a moving wall filled with medium turret is still the best thing i've done so far.\n\nLooking to unlock futher components even is it's take ages to do so.\n\nTopCake/10\nDo try it and replace ingame braindead bots.

computers from 10 years ago.\n\n-You are rewarded after every match if you win\n\n-It is relatively easy to build a very successful vehicle.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-It is an early access game and is subject to

[spoiler] As much as I like only versing bots, I noticed a pattern with bots, if you disable their weapons, they are going to try to ram you to death instead of going for the cap point (where applicable, some probably couldnt drive because lack of wheels). Every now and then, a player will hop in and play against me, but so far the meta, personally, is to try to take out guns and wheels on actual players, let the bots kill each other in their weird bloodbath, and if all else fails, earn that cap if possible...I cant tell you how many draws I got just because everyone was trying to kill each other and no one was going for a cap when time ran out. I made the mistake of letting a live player go after disabling his weapons, and they went to cap and ended up losing due to the cap points being 0-1. [/spoiler]\n\n[*]Now my experience with the premium car you get: I didnt drive it, but it looks nice, but from what I see, it will be great on land, but suck on any wet patch as it not only slows you down slowly, but you cant steer...at all, aka hydroplaning. I see 2 shotguns, so its a close up fighter, but doesnt have much armor, so its really great for driveby shooting if you know how to aim while driving by/circling around. You dont want to be standing still with this car unless you want your opponent to shoot off your shotguns/wheels until you die. Is the car itself worth $30? Nah, the game is nice so far and you do get to keep it and the ingame currency you get into the open beta and final release, so it will be a nice car to boost your level when things get reset. Its around 2000 powerscore, so by no means is it OP, I would reccomend for beginners to use the car for a quick level boost, but for mid to late game, I would think building a newer mashine is much better.\n\n[*] The market? I wouldnt bother buying anything from the market right now with ingame currency if you do decide to buy early access, the prices are insane at the moment.\n[/list]\n\n[u]Day 2:[/u]\n[list]\n\n[*]I tried out the premium vehicle that you get from buying early access to the closed beta of this game, all I can say is if you like controllable powersliding, this is the vehicle for you, and its blue rated mostly-everything-on-it, especially the dual shotguns, well placed shots can quickly disarm/disable your opponents. You will have to be at a angle, since both shotguns cant aim directly behind or in front of you. [spoiler]Protip: Sneak for cap point, get 1 point if all you are playing against in PvP are bots, go for 2 if there are live players, you can rush back to get the 3rd if they try capping your point. Aim for the guns, means of mobility, leave for dead until you rinse and repeat for all enemies, then go kill everyone, ez mode.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1476393610, "timestamp_updated": 1476570129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25936440": {"recommendationid": "25936440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025415696", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4549, "last_played": 1499112583}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game but...

That out of the way if you ever played robocraft, its like mad max meats robo craft. That is what drew me to this I saw the P2W comments then realised this is gonna be f2p so these just the usual needs an excuse crowd. This game just like other new games Gaijen is helping out like Starconflict has both PVP and PVE going on you do not have to be a master at PVP, like some people think. So to some up, like Robocraft meets mad max, gonna be f2p before year is out, but has PVP and PVE options\n\nAlright lets start with like Robocraft, meets mad max. If you can't tell form videos and what not you can make your own rides thes all kind of look like standard real life cars but in reality its like robocraft they were just built that way, because it works. You get specaly under carrage parts you can make them long and wide if you fee like it. But most don't got wide as you attack head on normally or camp head on its not bad idea to go skinny and long to fit all your parts.\n\nLike Robocraft its based score system but unlike it where you limited on what parts to use, any part you can get your hands on and you do earn armor parts via grind, but can buy, earn or craft ingame all the non armor parts its just a bit of work for the high end stuff. Now the way this works isn't MMO style its a shooter for one, like robo craft its score based every bock you can use has its own score, and stats so you can't make a an armed beast with legendary guns and be in the low level matches you basicly have to be a a pair of tracks, a cabin and a gun to do that lol. Anyways that is how it works.\n\nNow some people new to this think every one who is higher then them must be magicly using hte best ever parts in spades. But you can't do this, you can't rock high end parts with out compromising and using paper armor on most your rig. Now what you do is armor one key spot normally the front people don't get that and shoot that one armored part and think its all a tank but a shotgun or cannon shell to the side and you rip off half their stuff there, thanks to the score system, or just shoot off the gun(s) if you got an accurate weapon like maching gun or aiming with a cannon.\n\nNow I got that covered here is the next part people don't get, this is going f2p all these max levels you may see, I hardly see, a rank 40. These guys are gonna be reset to one just like you when CBT ends, then on top of that tons of new players with out good gear are gonna pile in right 98% of players paid some kind of cash and bought some pack full of nice parts to start with on day one, but there is a whole world of cheap gamers who will show up when this is new with none of that, and of course complain your too op with your 2 shotguns in the steam pack lol.\n\nI warn people of this becuase that freaks them out, yes your are gonna get wiped, but your playing now to learn how to play so one day one, you can b-line for your fave playstyles parts, you can use this time to dink around get killed, kill a few yourself, and look at all these vets builds when you die. Don't run to the garage and rage that you can't reque till your rig is out. You are gonna get wiped anyways, so look at the others when your dead. Make a note of how they did their rigs, how they play the game, and learn so you can try it out. Who cares if you go bust doing it, on day one you are reset as well as the rest of us. I learned heaps from that and now lets play videos of other people with no clue like me, testing and failing or suceeding.\n\nLast bit this has a bit of PVE and PVP the way it works is simple you can't just PVE all day long unless you want work for it. PVE requires gas in your tank, every day I think you get more, but if you pvp with a feul barrel, it cost no energy used for impartant parts like guns and weapong radiators, but catch is you want to hide it and protect it, because its a gas tank it explodes when broken and can tear up parts near it when it goes. But you put that in your build and now every win you bring back some gas, and to make it more awsome it doesn't go in the tank with 200 limit you pile it in your storage with the parts for making your rig. So you can pile up tons of it, and sell it if need be to other players for stupid cheap, not really worth it, or just right click pour in the tank to top it off so I can PVE all day.\n\nAnd what is the big diff minus the gas PVE gets you coupons, collect 300 and you can make a loot crate. Think of it like those chests you need p2w keys in other games to open but you don't in this. You open it up and its a chance you gonna get a part from any faction in game of blue or purple qulity or small chance you get a cometice. Now the cosmetic you think oh that is lame these give you rep bonus if you use them on your rig, basicly exp bonus and you can sell them to other players on the market who want that bonus, or just want to make a pretty car with it. You get a cap for these coupons every day based on diffculty, You also copper sheets used to make blue quality gear, and some wires for high end stuff. So even PVPers need to do a little basic PVE if they wnat stay ahead.\n\nAnd that long winded reveiw is basicly what you need to know I didn't share any fun stories or cool stuff like that just basic stuff you should want to know before buying the steam pack. Things people come in and have no idea about. So to sum up again its like robocraft meets madmax, its score based not level. Its gonna be f2p, you could wait till then but then you could also rage about not knowing anything about how the game works first hand, and about people like me using are 2 little shotguns to tear up your stuff, even though I have expeinced guys with common grade lmgs tear them off all the time in pvp leaving me only with the abilty to try and ram before my wheels are shot off next lol And lastly it has pretty decent pvp, and pve system you need a bit of both but could just go all in either one, if you want work a little more, and buy and sell things to get the copper from not raiding, or buy gas because you don't like pvp.", "timestamp_created": 1473024104, "timestamp_updated": 1473177883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.401036351919174194", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25334542": {"recommendationid": "25334542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027103104", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 55988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1675733562}, "language": "english", "review": "Crossout is a game that brings robocraft and the world of mad max together.

More cabs, guns, tracks, wheels, engines and mods, along with 3 new factions and more than double the structure parts. Very engrossing.\n\nI would like to address the \"pay to win\" argument briefly. The game is broken into 4 basic \"tiers\" in terms of item cost, white, blue, purple, and gold. White items you get just for completing missions, the rest must be bought on the market (don't craft unless you very much know what you're doing). The average cost of items goes as follows.\n\nBlue ~ 30c\nPurple ~ 300c\nGold ~ 2000c\n\nEach game nets you approximatly 1c, and assuming ~20 games per hour, you can comfortably afford one or two new blues a day. Now the question becomes are blues competative against golds and purples. The answer is an unequivocal YES. As someone who   bought the game back when it was $30, i've never really been trapped in the blue tier as they start you out with 2000c, but nonetheless some of my favorite and most competative builds are totally blue. I have a very expensive walker with 2 gold cannons and routinely get smacked down by some cheeky fuck running 4 blue shottys on a wedge car. Team play, driver skill, and efficient design win the day, not  expensive gear. If you download this game and drop 50 bucks on the market for the biggest baddest cannons, you will get crushed by 4 players who can squad effectively and know what your gonna do before you do it.\n\nIf you download the game and arn't winning more than half your games, i suggest you take a trip over to the crossout reddit page which will give you lots of information about efficient design, weapon synergy, obscure game mechanics, and even some good blueprints for nubs.", "timestamp_created": 1472781111, "timestamp_updated": 1525642918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469798654317855835", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25286274": {"recommendationid": "25286274", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963794499", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 913, "last_played": 1472682783}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like games like Robocraft you will probably like this (I haven't played Robocraft since 2015 so I base this on how the game was back then).

Just like WoT matchmaking is not based on level but based on the the base body/class of your vehicle, the better body you use allows you bigger/better guns etc which in turn puts you in higher ranked matches. However just like in WoT if you try and power lvl into getting the better body's as quick as possible you wont have the resources to be able to equip your car very well so you\u2019re gonna constantly get your bum handed to you. So its very much worth your while sticking with a body and building up resources to get it well equipped.\n\nAnyway that's my first impressions see you at the end of my sights!", "timestamp_created": 1472419158, "timestamp_updated": 1472498359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535980641841888428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25209474": {"recommendationid": "25209474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107343973", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2613, "last_played": 1609697795}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really fun.

Now that it is open beta and f2p, the que times are near instant and I can finally enjoy this hidden gem once again\nI'm writing this review to explain how it isn't pay-to-win in any way, shape, or form. For a quick \"Do I recommend this game?\" Yes I do. Hands down. Even in its early access-closed beta state, it is extremely addictive and fun. It needs polishing but thats why it is in closed beta, for feedback and improvement. 8/10 (for a free game when it launches, I think it deserves 8-9/10). \nNOW onto p2w. In the game you can purchase \"packs\". These packs simply give you a better boost to starting the game by giving you a stronger starter vehicle, the performance of these cars is nowhere near any higher tier cars ive faced. Other than that slight boost, you cannot buy ANYTHING else. You cannot buy parts with money, cars, or !Coins!. Coins get you anything you want (depending on the cost), if you could buy coins, it would be pay 2 win. But since you can't it isn't even close to pay2win. \nBesides, having a strong car won't even guarentee you a win. You cannot carry in this, no matter how hard you try. Sure, some games you will wipe the whole team, but that is every so often. Otherwise this game does require skill and there are counters in the game for each style of battle. Melee, long range, and sustain as I would lable them. Also due to the limitations in crafting (energy, part limit, and weight: all which can be increased with level and parts to a certain extent) no one can be overly OP. (unless you are using a Leviathan which is No Holds Barred in custimization).\nSide Note: The custimization is great. It is truly what I wished the Twisted Metal franchise should have been. \nEDIT: I would also like to add that, yes, during American day-time hours, the game can have low player count and long que times. That is because it isn't very popular here yet, it is a Russian made game so it is more popular in Europe. If you switch servers Europe, that will help you slightly, but playing later at night will help more since that is when Europeans are online mainly. Otherwise, wait until more people get the game, it only just came out on Steam and IS in closed beta, so low player count is to be EXPECTED. When the game is Free, you can surely expect a HUGE rise in the player base.\nEDIT2: With the help of the power level system. Even if you bought as much as possible from the packs, you would simply be put with other people who bought the same stuff. So it isnt pay 2 win if you are just against people just as strong as you, making it an even match.", "timestamp_created": 1472279456, "timestamp_updated": 1496604931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547729432582855225", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25173931": {"recommendationid": "25173931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032873573", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1473523730}, "language": "english", "review": "TF2 with army trucks. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1472268211, "timestamp_updated": 1472268211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438762128353118896", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25173907": {"recommendationid": "25173907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282114115", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1138, "last_played": 1472421454}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

It may be because of something from prior to the steam release.  Let me explain why this is nonsense.  You can unlock any part and craft it without spending money.  You can make currency by selling parts you make or selling scrap (used to make parts).  You can buy parts and vehicles but you're going to be stuck with players who match your vehicle's rating.  So it's not like you can buy your way to better equipement than who you're playing against, you can just sort of skip the grind to a small extent.\n\nAs for gameplay this game is sort of arcadey driving with pretty good physics, reminds me of driving a warthog in Halo, except steering is independent of the camera.  Rounds tend to be fairly short and you can go from one to the other very quickly.  The vehicle customization gives you a lot of freedom and there appears to be a pretty large diversity of weapons \n\n30$ is a bit steep but the game is very very fun.

Let me explain why: \n\nAll those shiny high end guns they have? You can shoot them off. Those power increasing generators they have? You can shoot them until they explode. \n\nThe destructability of the cars, in my opinion really negate the P2W aspects. Sure you probably won't fair well in the starter car against a cannon, but its not like you don't have any kind of chance. Shoot off wheels and they will just sit there. Blow off the guns and they can't hurt you from a range. Melee weapons (Spikes, explosive lances and the like) seem a bit OP right now, but at the same time, they have to get really close to use them.\n\nSo all in all I reccommend this game. I'll give you a list here so you can just look at that.\n\nPros\n1. Total Customization - Build a vehicle completely unique to you.\n2. 100% Destructability - You can shoot off individual parts. \n3. Going F2P - Here soon it will be F2P, you'll have nothing to lose but your time by giving it a shot.\n4. Graphics - Game looks really good, thats just my opinion, it is subjective mind you.\n5. Optimized - I'm running pretty powerful hardware, but the game seems really smooth, even with everything going on.\n6. Market - In-game market makes it easy to buy and sell parts you want.\n\nCons\n1. Grindy - It can take some time to get really badass parts. Like a lot of time.\n2. Timers - When you make things, there are wait times. Some of them get pretty long.\n3. Match Finding - Parties can only go against other parties and it WILL increase your wait time just because of this. \n\nIndifferent\n1. P2W Factor - It is P2W, sure, but the ability to get premium currency is pretty easy and even though the fancy parts are helpful, they can get destroyed in matches (Not forever mind you, you'll always have those parts unless you sell them) and those factors combined negate it in my opinion.\n2. Bots - More than likely, you'll end up in matches that are comprised entirely of Bots. This I think helps reduce wait time finding matches, but Bots are easy to scrap, mostly. \n\nAll in all, I do reccommend this game. Remember kids, reviews are opinions, I find that I like this game, you might hate it for the exact reasons I like it and thats ok.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention Power Score herlping to Negate P2W aspects as well. Its basically your vehicle rating. Match making trys to put you with similarly scored players.
