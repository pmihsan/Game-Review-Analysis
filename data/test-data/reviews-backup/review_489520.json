I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Minion Masters offers players one verse one or two verse two competition taking place in small arenas. Players choose between different Masters with unique hero abilities. They then use these masters to summon collectible minions to the field. Once they\u2019re on the field, it\u2019s pretty much up to them what they\u2019re going to do, so choose carefully.\n\nMinion Masters offers several modes, standard one verse one and two verse two, one verse one draft, mayhem, expeditions, and solo challenges. In one verse one draft, players build their deck from a random selection of cards. During this mode, three loses means the player is out of the game. Mayhem offers different rules every week. Expeditions are the game\u2019s story mode. And solo challenges allow players to practice against the game\u2019s AI.\n\nTo progress in the game, players will need to learn how to utilize their masters as well as unlock or craft an increasing number of minions and spells.\n\nMinion Masters promises nearly constant new content, with the developers adding new things all the time, including events and cosmetics. \n\nMinion Masters taps into an unused format seen in free to play titles, let alone gaming itself. A combination of charming characters, visually appealing graphics and an addictive progression system weave together to present a game you won\u2019t want to miss.", "timestamp_created": 1630384100, "timestamp_updated": 1630384100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51677548885345459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94528491": {"recommendationid": "94528491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098046257", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2150, "last_played": 1659220631}, "language": "english", "review": "fun easy chill game!!", "timestamp_created": 1624821962, "timestamp_updated": 1624821962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94490184": {"recommendationid": "94490184", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967559738", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6296, "last_played": 1668767985}, "language": "english", "review": "After years of hopping in & out of the game, now the game it's really interesting, try it and you will se something that's not new at all, play more and you will discover some of the mechanics but you will need to play even more to fully understand the potential... this game is absolutely entertaining, every card, no matter how powerfull it might be, can be countered by something else, every card can be crafted no matter if you spent or not money on the game.

We were looking for a simple time waster while we waited on a group of friends playing some other game we didn't care for.  I've been hooked every since and have spread the love to many others.\n\nThe basic concept of the game is fairly simple, build a deck of cards that you instantiate into the arena.  Those cards (minions/spells/etc) then autonomously follow their developer coded instructions in eliminating other minions or making their way to attack the opposing master(s).  The deck construction mechanic is fairly straightforward where you attempt build a deck that takes advantage of synergies between the cards and your master's powers.  It won't take you long to realize just  how easy it is to steal decks from other players.  When a strong meta emerges, fully two-thirds of the decks you face will be so similar as to be identical.  Most of the remainder will be decks setup to counter the meta.\n\nFor me, the best part is taking a deck and becoming comfortable enough with it that you can counter strong meta decks or even decks that take advantage of the weaknesses of your deck.

I, for myself, can say that I had alot of fun!\n\nYou basically play a hero, to be more precise: a Minion Master, who spawns minions to let them fight for victory. Which basically means that they fight to destroy the enemy tower, or die trying. The various amount of different cards and the seemingly endless card-combinations make this game quite attractive for competetive players!\nYou'll be put into leagues, so there is a matchmaking in this game, which will make you face enemies, who are (hopefully) around your skill-level.\n\nWhat really boosts the fun is that the game doesn't support the levelling up of your cards, you'll never fight a level 9 dragon, while yours is still stuck at level 4. matter of fact: The balancing of this game is basically great, there are enough ground and air units and also enough buildings.\n\nThe only things that actually count negative towards the Fun are the bugs, but yeah, more of that in the [i]Polishment[/i]-Section!\n\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nGraphics are not really important for this kind of game, as long as you can distinguish the different units you have basically done a good job!\n\nBut that wasn't enough for [i]BetaDwarf[/i]! They actually implented great graphics to this game, and released a graphic overhaul, after they worked enough on the polishment (see \"Update 60 - Looks matter\").\n\n\n[b]Sounds:[/b]\nSounds don't really serve a big purpose in Minion Masters. They basically just work towards the authencity of the battlefield, and imho it does a bit of a difference!\n\nBut what actually gives the game an extra pluspoint in sounds is the commentator, who gets triggered at the beginning, at the end and in the running game, if something important/amazing happened.\n\n\n[b]Polishment:[/b]\nSo yeah, this game offers quite a bit already:\n- Guilds (and special events for these)\n- Mayham-Mode\n- Matchmaking (1v1 and 2v2)\n- Expeditions\n- Single-Player-Mode\n\nUpdates are coming in regular intervalls and they improve the polishment of the games in many regards: Balancing, additional modes, overhauls, etc.!\n\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]\nTo sum it up: This game is great, if you liked Clash Royale and wanna try out another Multiplayer-Tower-Defense-Game on the PC with more cards, better balancing and (imh) better graphics, try this one, you probably won't get disappointed!\n\nAlso, it's free right now!", "timestamp_created": 1553108617, "timestamp_updated": 1553108678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49634603": {"recommendationid": "49634603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156950880", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1635, "last_played": 1653682135}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not sure which genre this game falls into.

It has a very good f2p model, not pay to win; this becomes apparent when you look at the decks of the top ranking players, most of them only have one or two legendary cards which can be put in any type of deck, the rest of them are easy to come by. The game is easy to understand, the strategies become more advanced as you progress through ranks so you won't be overwhelmed as a new player.

The game is extremely easy to pick up and play. The develepors have described it as easy to play but hard to master, and that is very true. There are a lot of subtle nuances to how each card plays and you can only figure them out by playing more and more.\n\n[h1]The Mechanics:[/h1]\nYou have a deck of 10 cards that you can customize outside of a match (just like in other TCGs). When a match starts, your deck is shuffled and the top 4 cards are dealt to you. When you play a card, it goes to the bottom of your deck and is automatically replenished by the top card. Apart from just seeing the 4 cards in your hand, you are also able to see the next card you will draw. Thus, you have some control over crafting the state of your hand and making combos happen more than once in a match.\n\nYou can get new cards by using power tokens in a roulette-style gambling system. Power tokens must be bought using either gold or rubies. The only other way to get cards is via single card offers that change on a day-to-day basis (usually cost rubies but occasionally some high gold cost offers do come up). For example, 1 random legendary for 16000 gold. So, make sure to save up some gold for those offers once you have a sizeable collection. \n\nAlong with your deck, you also get to pair a Master with it that represents your life points in the game (always starts with 3000). Each of these masters has 3 perks (abilities) that are either active (card(s) added to your deck) or passive, and are unlocked during the match when you maintain control of the two bridges in the middle of the arena. There are 9 masters as of this review (12-20-2018), and one more might be added by the end of the month. You can acquire masters by spending either blue shards (earned in-game at a steady pace) or red rubies (must pay $$$ to get enough).\n\n[h1]Lots of game modes and events:[/h1]\nIn the beginning, you have to get through a short tutorial before you gain full control of the game itself. By level 9 (i think), you unlock most of the game modes: draft, mayhem and expeditions, along with the basic battle and team battle modes. Pairing up with another player is extremely easy; it only requires you to be steam friends with the other player.\n\nThe devs always have something new going on in terms of events. The events usually have 3 different houses, each of which has 15 keys associated with them. If you collect all 15 keys for a house, you get a legendary card. Keys can be earned by winning prize fights, which is just randomly determined at the start of a match, and by using streamer keys (watch out for those in the global chat!).\n\n[h1]Pay to Win?[/h1] [b]I don't think so.[/b]\nI got to Master league without paying anything with quite a few supreme rares and a couple legendary cards. I played so much last month that I got upto level 75 in the battle pass with only two season gold stars. I had earned 1000 rubies just by way of in-game rewards then finally coughed up 5 bucks to get 200 more rubies to purchase the battle pass. I got so many rewards at once (33 season tokens lol), it was beautiful. This is one of the most balanced free-to-play models i've seen in a while.

There are 1v1, 2v2, Draft mode, Adventure Mode and Challenge (vs AI) mode.  The game itself is super fair, you just have to collect the cards (about 120 right now) and you cant level them up. On my first day i already collected 55/120 card and now, 2 days later i have already more than 80 cards in my collection, without paying more money  There are a few legendary cards that are harder to get but they are not neccessary, and u get 2 from quests and i already got one from a chest. \n\nThe only thing you can buy are other masters, which give you some special abilities and basically defend your base. There are 9 different masters right now, and you start with one of the best ones already (They are all good and there is no \"best\" master, they just support different strategies). And there is a weekly rotation of 2 additional masters, so u have at least 3 out of 9 masters available at all time. After 1-2 days i got enough crystals from quest to buy TWO more, and i then i decided to paid 10\u20ac to buy 3 more masters, because i rly liked the game and wanted to support the developers. So i have 6 out of 9 masters now, after 3 days and 15\u20ac total for the game. You dont have to use any money, but getting enough crystals for the masters could take some time. \n\nThe gameplay is AWESOME and you can try out soo many different decks and strategies and every game feels different. Some are RLY close and that are the coolest ones. \nDont get fooled by the negative comments, its NOT grindy and you unlock the cards soo fast.

The developers were fairly swift in fixing the bugs/glitches I had personally encountered. They also seem to make an appearance in-game via chat every now and again, allowing you to contact them directly if need be.\n\nPeople seem to highly discredit Minions Masters for its cons, yet make no note of the games pros. There are PLENTY of both. The game is still changing quite often, the cards people use are often changing too. The meta shifts in this game with every patch. They also release new cards and balance previous cards every so often, which of course forces the meta to change as well.\n\nI've read some negative reviews in regards to \"leveling up cards\". This mechanic is 100% irrelevant when it comes to the cards strength, despite reading negative reviews for this (I don't even recall it being a mechanic in previous patches). Currently, powering up a card simply awards you more points for a victory if you're using the card in your deck. This point system is only relevant to the some-what new \"season rewards\" that were released.\n\nYou DO NOT need to spend money on this game to make decent progress, at least not at this time. Investing $20 will give you a boost of a couple of weeks, but other than that.. Yeah. I have personally only purchased the \"Premium Upgrade\" and have been set ever since.\n\nOverall, it reminds me of a mixture between Clash Royale and Hearthstone, two games I've invested a lot of time and money in. If you enjoy either of them, you'll probably find enjoyment in Minion Masters as well.

I will say the hard work you've done to grind something out is always less than what someone who bought the premium upgrades would have in half that time you put in, especially in regards to the battle pass, ALTHOUGH none of which affect ability or win rate so it's cool.\n\nIn general the game is an awesome cheap and soon to be F2P game and if you've got the time the game is completely doable without buying a thing unless you want the premium edition.", "timestamp_created": 1530906287, "timestamp_updated": 1530906287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43321890": {"recommendationid": "43321890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133258895", "num_games_owned": 773, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2013, "last_played": 1657272610}, "language": "english", "review": "top teir", "timestamp_created": 1530791101, "timestamp_updated": 1530791101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459943443536758423", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43140861": {"recommendationid": "43140861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107942809", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 915, "last_played": 1677443759}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than clash royale.", "timestamp_created": 1530224524, "timestamp_updated": 1530224524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487943261861801147", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43135954": {"recommendationid": "43135954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198806889304", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 524, "last_played": 1568042604}, "language": "english", "review": "Epic", "timestamp_created": 1530210527, "timestamp_updated": 1575832145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42985571": {"recommendationid": "42985571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074861886", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1529858110}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun card game, it's suprisingly interesting and strategic.

When you just start playing and learning the meta game, gold and rubies will start adding up in you account, just by playing. Each 1000 gold will basicly give you a new card (via Powertokens), and quickly you will start adding up in your collection. You can earn every card in the game just by playing, or even trading (for shards) and craft the card you need be yourself. Admitted your collection will grow faster if you pay for power tokens, but its not mandatory.\n\nThe game it self is really a \"rock/paper/scissor\" kinda game. Added to that there is the deck building aspect, and the sneeky ways to combine cards that makes this so much fun, and a really great strategy game as well. No matter what card your opponent throws at your there is for the most part a cheaper counter. And getting the \"upper hand\" in mana management is a big factor in beeing succesful.\n\nI wont go into details on specific cards, but with currently around 100 cards in the game there a endless combinations of making a deck of 10 cards and see the minions battle it out  :)\n\nReminds me of an old game called \"Magic the gathering battlegrounds\" , and thats not a bad thing.\n\nI highly reccomend this game, it can be very addicting :)", "timestamp_created": 1528296597, "timestamp_updated": 1528296597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5437508225440979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42432328": {"recommendationid": "42432328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198382436293", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 601, "last_played": 1551019134}, "language": "english", "review": "best kart game", "timestamp_created": 1527884662, "timestamp_updated": 1527884662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461711704730987549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42311239": {"recommendationid": "42311239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063924146", "num_games_owned": 1773, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 174835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60034, "last_played": 1592683077}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice and fun little game.

Its like chess in that u have to use strategy and defend as well as go offensive.  Lower cards are more quick but do less damage. Higher cards take a couple more seconds to use but they are usually worth the wait... unless your opponent is attacking you with numerous minions at once.  Different heros u choose have different special attacks that are incorporated in the match along with your cards.  Fun strategy game.... I recommend this game for a fun casual gaming experience. Matches last anywhere from 1 minute to 10 tops. usually matches are 5 minutes long.  after getting the game i have not spent a penny and i have a deck that can compete with most anyone.  it takes a lil while to get the hang of it but all u do is click on the right cards at the right time and your creatures will do the rest.  There are different choices for main character with different special abilities and skins too...all of which you can get for free just by playing ...and game is fun so playing is actually more fun than a grind.  I hope this game stays poplular so the ques to get into game remains at only a few seconds to find a match usually. u can solo or team with randoms which is actually super fun with the 2v2. but 1v1 is great too.  VERY FUN AFFORDABLE Addicting game. \n\nNOW for the Bad NEWS:\n\nOK now its been months and nothing new except a couple cards. I want new characters with new card abilities and maybe rework some of the cards nobody uses.  its fun for a while but game is standing still right now which saddens me because this game is a blast to play....just not same stuff over and over. also if the characters had a bigger difference and or a skill that was actually useful that would be fun too. but really so many cards could be so much better.  now its hard to get enough cards for a deck that I like. when i first started it was fun but now i see 75% of cards are prettty unuseable.  I hope they update the cards soon... and make the characters have better abilities.... and add new characters we can use with different abilities.  like an archer character that makes all crossbow skills cost one mana less even. just something to make the characters more different and fun. so as of now this game was fun for a bit but due to nothing exciting happening i hardly play. i dont know. i do know its worth a couple dollars though.", "timestamp_created": 1525499661, "timestamp_updated": 1530523424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41841575": {"recommendationid": "41841575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040862654", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 384, "last_played": 1661280230}, "language": "english", "review": "Id have to say give it a shot for the sake of competition .", "timestamp_created": 1525416038, "timestamp_updated": 1525416038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41821611": {"recommendationid": "41821611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198447866492", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1559969861}, "language": "english", "review": "its a nice game. the way that it can go is base on the player", "timestamp_created": 1525314385, "timestamp_updated": 1525314385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41819046": {"recommendationid": "41819046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005556083", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1665872246}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy to get into. \nFun to play.", "timestamp_created": 1525297558, "timestamp_updated": 1525297558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41731593": {"recommendationid": "41731593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056416243", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 9517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4824, "last_played": 1597860643}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is good i would like some skins for some of the minions too.. to trick the enemy a bit. but the game is extremely fun and well balanced as long as your smart or have a good team you can win", "timestamp_created": 1524905608, "timestamp_updated": 1524905608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41729536": {"recommendationid": "41729536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201887271", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 4231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1647, "last_played": 1673330547}, "language": "english", "review": "1000000x yesssss", "timestamp_created": 1524896523, "timestamp_updated": 1524896523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.421477258205413818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41708331": {"recommendationid": "41708331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135042397", "num_games_owned": 982, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 629, "last_played": 1621059703}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a lot of FUN! it has a very simple system and is a very chill game to relax and play with.

Personally, I keep getting high tier cards and lose quite often because the energy required to play the card is a lot, when the other player has multiple characters to counter my single one on the field... but even with the bad luck and challenge. it is still a very fun game and I fully recommend this game.\n\n\nI feel like the developers have a LOT in mind for this game and I am personally Really excited to see what they do with it and where it goes! The current card set is a bit small, but it is still in the early stages of development and I\u2019m sure there will be loads more content to come... I believe the playing field should be a little bit larger than it is now, and the 2v2 should be a person at each corner instead of next to each other. This allowing one person to die and the other to live to fight on. But to counter the death the energy increases by 2/3s so they have a fighting chance. It also moves them to the middle of the field instead of staying in the corner.  \n\nBut in the end, I do suggest you try it out for yourself because I really enjoy playing this game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1524790355, "timestamp_updated": 1524790355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41687007": {"recommendationid": "41687007", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995274635", "num_games_owned": 1199, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39, "last_played": 1524599307}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this for myself and a friend i thought it was silly that they reused all the assets from forced showdown which was a really fun game for this mediocre game but whatever someone has to like it\n\nmy friend screamed the entire hour he played about how it's so awful he's given up on videogames\n\nwhile I don't like the game I recommend it because you should give it to a friend while it's on sale and actually damage their sanity", "timestamp_created": 1524683389, "timestamp_updated": 1524683389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517858564853668213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41670298": {"recommendationid": "41670298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260013620", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 2551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 863, "last_played": 1575592816}, "language": "english", "review": "i wasnt sure if id like that when i bought it..

Id like to thank them for not banning me too. Its highly appreciated.\nWhen it comes to modifying a game, NEVER modify a mmorpg. It can get your game banned, and possibly your steam account too. Only reason I modified it, was because when I purchased the game at the time, it was a cheap game I got with one of those 90% off coupons, and wasnt advertsied as an online game. When I tried it the first time around, I got slaughtered so made my modifications, and slaughtered every boss monster that was thrown at me. It wasnt till I got a message in the chat window I was going to be reported, that I found out I was actually playing against another player. I quickly contacted the company and asked for a reset. \nAfter that, they replied, and I gave them all information on what I had done so as it can be fixed so no one else does the same. \n[b][h1]Minion Masters is a great game. As you level up, you get rewards to modify what you have, or just buy new things from the store as well.

Never the less, I still long for the days where the game was a little more cartoonish with a larger deployable area for greater and more flexible unit interactions. All that said, the review has been changed to Positive, and the previous review shall remain as is below for posterity.\n---\nWhile I truly enjoyed this game, Update 60, 'The Visual Rework Update' has ruined my enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe Visual Rework has made the game more crisp, and defined with deeper blacks and shaper edges.

It's not even that unrealistic to get the highest rank but know you're going to battle the same 10 people right now...Sometimes like 5 in a row!!

Also your lane and the opponents lane are connected by bridges. You will have control over a bridge if your minion is the last one there(standing or passing over the bridge) and vice versa. Controlling the bridge will make you level up faster. Yes your king(master) have level. Everybody start on level 0 and will start gaining xp to level up with the max being level 3. Each king(master) will have 3 skills and you'll unlock your first skill on reaching level 1 and so on. Your king(master) tower have more HP than in clash royale. \nAlso, unlike in clash royale, your cards dont have levels, meaning your opponent cant have an advantage of having higher level cards.\n\nTIP: This game is more of spamming your cards (units, spells, etc), because there's not that much space to let you strategize a lot (strategizing don't have that much of an impact on the gameplay, unlike clash royale).

Many reviews claim that this game is pay-to-win, but top tier players can reach top 1-5 with almost only basic cards.\n- Very quick battles, often over in under 5 minutes.\n- Good card variety allowing for different strategies.\n- Your deck consists of 10 cards, and your hand of 4. This means you can quickly cycle your deck, and the game revolves a lot more around skill than luck of the draw, like other card games.\n- Next to no RNG. Some cards are pure RNG, but they're a gamble you chose to take. The only RNG that's forced on you is the initial hand and draw. Some decks rely on a single card that you buff / heal, if you don't draw this card first, this can be a problem. However, this is also a risk you chose to take. You can make a versatile deck that has an answer for almost everything, so any draw can be useful with those.\n- Looks great, and sounds nice.\n- Draft mode and 2v2 if 1v1 isn't your thing, this means you can play with a buddy.\n- You can customize your arena, as well as your master. There are also emotes you can use while in-game.\n\nCons:\n\n- Some balance issues, as is often the case in PvP games.\n- You need a good computer to be able to run it on max settings.\n- Not a huge playerbase, this means you will see the same people often.

Obviously, if you do pay then you can get things quicker, but it doesn't really have any major influence on winning or not. I have been using a combination of cards that is mostly made up of the ones that I started the game with and have won more than I have lost. With regular playing and completing the challenges, you can build up a good deck and save shards and rubies to open up new characters and arenas. Obvously, if you are impatient and want to get everything immediately, then paying for the premium upgrade will help you to unlock all the main masters and some arenas. Some grinding will always be present in games where there are unlockables.\n\nA lot of people have made the comment that the game is dependent on luck, which I don't think is entirely true - tactics can win the game. Spamming low cost cards will sometimes work, but carefully using the deck will get around this. If you don't invest time in the game, then it will feel superficial. Give it some time, try out new masters and card combinations until you find soemthng that works and then go with that.\n\nThe graphics are great, the animation is smooth and the community isn't full of people shouting obscenitites at each other.

that wasn't evident by my >100 hour mark.  It boasts competitive deckbuilding, promotes good play and reactions just as strongly as good cards, and a wide amount of playstyles are very viable.  The interaction with real-world money consists mostly of pay-to-not-grind as opposed to any real pay-to-win, which I can appreciate.\n\nThe real issue, honestly, is the INTENSE learning curve, which I hope can be smoothed out somehow.  What you're not initially aware of is the fact that the baseline cards actually do allow you to deal with almost any situation, but you have to know 1) what the biggest threats are  2) how to play around those threats, and  3) what cards you have to include to deal with said threats.  Now I understand that may be inherent to card games, but this is a bit more 3-dimensional than just card vs card, stats vs stats.  With the addition of field positioning and real-time placement at stake, it's a lot of mechanics that can overwhelm a fresh player - myself included, once upon a time.  Also, 2v2's are a bit... hammy, but the game was designed initially around 1v1.\n\nIt's a very satisfying experience if you stick with it and understand it, though.

Rarity systems prevents you from getting the useful cards.\n\nThe other daily thing, this free spin only gives you small amounts of money, rubies or mana. You have to spin every day for 15 days to get 1 card.\n\nAlso you can use like 3 times the same card in your deck. So disenchanting your exess cards will not happen until very late.  If i get a card one time, why can' i simply put it in 3 times in a deck? Because they want to sell me cards would be the answer. \n\nIn the beginning it draws you in with new cards every 3 matches. \nThen it stops, even with premium upgrade it becomes a boring grind with losing a lot of times.\nWhy losing a lot of times?

It plays a lot like Clash Royale but there are two bridges in the game you need to control, the longer you have them under your control the more exp you get which enables your hero to do get some skills. IMHO it's a vast improvement over the Clash Royale game because each hero you has a a distinct playstyle, this leads to a lot of varieities in decks you play against. One thing I don't like though is deck slots are locked till lvl 20, it's a pain to make decks or search for the card you want.\n\nI find the business model to be both fair and a bit unsatisfying. On one hand you get a pack a day, there is dust to craft cards you need and there is a \"free rotation\" on heroes. On the other hand though, the \"pack\" is really just one card so buying power stones isn't that satisfying, once you have a decent collection good luck getting new cards as you will just get duplicates which will get dusted. I bought 10 power stones and got dust and a crappy card.  Another thing is you still need to buy heroes separately, of course you can also grind for it using freemium currency but this game isn't exactly free to play so why are we paying more stuff for heroes? If this is the business model then just make it F2P outright, they have a promotion giving out free steam keys for people following their newsletter which essentially makes this game free, but for the average Steam player who has no idea there's such a thing he'll be paying for the game, and then pay for it again in micro transactions. At least right now though paying $13 gives you the Premium upgrade for free so you're getting something for your money and players who didn't get a free steam key don't feel like they got ripped off. \n\nEven with these gripes though the game is still pretty good and addicting, I find it to be much improved version of Clash Royale both in mechanics and business model. I highly recommend it. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1484355358, "timestamp_updated": 1484355358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527681648731231689",

A game from the company that created FORCED (Superb co-op game with friends btw) and FORCED shutdown (Somekind of a card arena brawler, which TotalBiscuit enjoyed). Minion Masters has to be something different right? Well it is!\n\nMinion Masters is essentially Hearthstone which plays more like a fast-paced RTS than a card game. You don't have turns, your only limiting factor is mana which replenishes over time. You only have 10 cards in your deck but instead of dissappearing after being used they are re-entered to your deck. You draw cards each time you spend one. The objective is to destroy the enemy's altar and master by using any means necessary. Matches themself generally last around 2-4 minutes and can be dominated in less than a minute as well.\n\nThe card types are minions, spells and buildings. The first two function similar to Hearthstone but the last one can be different. These are structures you plant on the map and they slowly decay while performing its' abilities. \n\nInstead of Heroes the game has Masters which each have a different passive attack (this essentially functions as your altar's defensive turret). Some attacks are small range ground AoEs while others are ground-air single target attacks etc... In addition the masters have other abilities which are unlocked through gaining XP during the match. XP is earned passively as the match progresses and also for controlling the two bridges in the middle of the map. These abilities range from adding new cards into the deck to improving the range of your ranged minions. The purpose of the abilities is to end the match and avoid stalemate thus they are very powerful. Each Master plays completely different and you must adjust your deck to favour that Master. Three of the masters are on the free rotation and you can purchase them permanently through crafting materials (earned by playing) or rubies (microtransactions).\n\nMinion Masters is fun and fast-paced 1v1 duel game that has similarities to RTS and Card games. It shines compared to its' competition by removing turns and rewarding for quick thinking and fast decisions. Ever had that Hearthstone match where the opponent spends 95% of his/her turn every time? Well do that in Minion Masters and you are going to lose in under a minute.\n\nPROs:\n\n+ Easy to learn, hard to master. NO TURNS.\n+ Short and intense matches (1-5 minutes), a single mistake or a good counter can turn the tide.\n+ No casual mode, every game is a ranked game (exception friend matches).\n+ 2-3 \"free\" cards each day by completing the daily. You'll get a decent deck running a lot faster than in other TCGs.\n+ Card crafting + duplicates into crafting resources.\n+ Rewards skill and tactics, higher rarity cards are not like legendaries in HS although still powerful.\n+ Very polished and constant updates considering it is early access v 0.11~~.\n+ FREE after launch (free keys still going around for EA).\n\nCONs:\n\n- Balance Issues (although very typical for ErAc games).\n- Reliance on dailies: The game rewards you very poorly for playing (even with the premium option they offer). ~30 matches for a card with premium, ~60 without, dailies are worth 2-3 cards. So essentially you need to play closer to 100 matches with premium to equal a single daily -> Much rather ONLY play with dailies.\n- Sometimes even too punishing, very difficult to come back after making a bad high cost play.\n\n-----\n\nIf you are looking for a card'ish game without TURNS to play for 30 min - 1 hour a day then Minion Masters is probably the best and only choice in the market even in its ErAc state. You can play the game for free by getting a key from giveaways/friends or waiting until it launches. The 20$ premium DLC package allows you to play instantly with some additional goodies.

It seems simple at first, you have a few cards in your deck, 4 of them in your hand all the time, you continously acquire mana which you spend to place them somewhere in the battlefield, then most of them start walking towards the enemy and they fight whatever they meet on the way. \nIt's simplicity is deceptive, to be really effective one needs to know many things and make good decisions quick. At heart it's a game of countering as the trailer suggests, but to effectively counter you need to know the cards in the game well. On the surface it might seem enough to know which card is able to damage which, but in reality their placement and even the timing of casting them matter a lot, sometimes an effective counter is nullified just by placing it half a second earlier then you should place them. Of course it matters what cards you have in your deck as they can be built for synergy and also variety to be able to counter whatever comes your way, but in my limited experience how you play them is more important. \nIt's one of the better examples of the easy to play, hard to master concept and a lot of fun for a game that you can play using just a mouse in a minute or two.", "timestamp_created": 1482078818, "timestamp_updated": 1482078818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535128891468048096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28310580": {"recommendationid": "28310580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138801631", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 80392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36105, "last_played": 1611428917}, "language": "english", "review": "Early Access V 0.9.1\n\nBefore we start I got a game key for free during alpha but since Early access I bought the premium upgrade at the same price as all new players since early access launch because currently premium upgrade includes in all new purchases.\n\nThe game revolves in the Forced universe. Betadwarf has made two prior games, Forced and Forced Showdown. I have played extensivly Forced Showdown and had alot of fun with it. WIth that in mind I had very high hopes for betadwarfs third game, Minion Masters.\n\nMinion Masters is the PC-variant of Clash Royale were players aquire cards (minions, spells, buildings) and put togethor a deck of 8 cards and battle an random opponent. The goal is to lower the health of the opponents master by 3000 points.\n(V.S friend battle is in development).\n\nTactics and counter knowledge is crucial to be a winner. All new players gets rubies, shards and gold because of the premium upgrade. Rubies are an purchable in-game currency (it is also rewarded by leveling up at certain levels and raise in leauge rank). Shards are also rewarded in the same regard as rubies, but are not purchable and can also be aquired if by spinning the power tower wheel (it is where you spend gold to get a random card). If you get a dublicate card, it is salvaged and you get shards in relation of that cards rarity.\n\nThe game is still in beta and under heavy development and balancing. Some cards might be a bit OP. But players with OP cards that plays badly, looses very easily against opponents with common cards. Many people complain over others that have aquired the rarest cards in the game (Legendarys). But the first Master rank I know of (Master is the highest rank in game currently) only played common and rare cards wich are the two lowest card tiers except for regulars that are awarded during the initial level up process. WIth that said. Rare cards does not equal a better card. Tactic and the know-how to counter the opponents card is crucial.\n\nTHe single-player campin consist of 3x5 battles I belive and is lack-luster at best. These servers more like a tutorial for the player to learn the game and level-up so that you can get most of the regual cards before you get to online-fightning and raise ones battle-rank. THis is a bit sad since I am a heavy single-player player.\n\nYou get one Master at the beginning. Other Masters go through a free-roatiation system that you can play for free at those time. If you want to be sure to always play those Master you have to buy it with the in-game resources. A Master have diffrent attacks and also a perk system. By controlling bridges in the game you get XP that levels up the Master. Up to 4 Perks can be aquired where that fourth and last perk is always Mana frenzy.\n\nAll in all I'm happy and surprised how much I enjoy this game. Updates comes regualary and new cards get added with it. New Masters are gonna be added soon. The devs are very communicative and listens to feed-back. Nerfing and buffing is gonna be frequent in teh early stages, but that is to be expected in an EA-game.\n\nGraphics 9/10\nGAmeplay 8/10\nFUn-factor 9/10\n\n(A tip to new players: Before you spend all your rubies and shards. Read forum and play a couple of battles and ask for tips. THat way you gonna know wich cards to craft and what tactic to use. This gonna reduce alot of frustrations early on before you can get most of the cards)", "timestamp_created": 1481466735, "timestamp_updated": 1511502839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671225547790527344", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28263056": {"recommendationid": "28263056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002338993", "num_games_owned": 710, "num_reviews": 153, "playtime_forever": 43426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10496, "last_played": 1590617082}, "language": "english", "review": "Who's writing the review?\nA long time player who even made it into the top 3 of the global ladder this season:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=950681417\n\nThe basic concept of this game is \"Clash Royale\" - but this game has A LOT more depth to it, better balancing and very active devs, as well as weekly updates and regular events.\n\n[u]Accessibility?[/u]\nWhile a lot of bad reviews of - sorry to be so direct - bad & salty players claim that this game is pay to win, this game is truely not.

At higher ranks however variety increases a lot. From gold rank onwards - and especially within the top 20 - the meta is incredibly fluent with everybody tweaking their decks against each other. \n\n[u]Summary:[/u]\nThis game deserves a lot more positive attention than it gets, it's simply that a lot of people see that this game's underlying concept is Clash Royale and judge a book by its cover instead of reading a few pages first.

Either per-player or even with the cards in their collection, still waiting for a game to go down that path and this seems like a great place for it to happen!\n - Clean up the UI when not in a game, having my arena is okay, but it feels cluttered at times.\n - Add polished transitions between UI-mode and actual game mode.\n - Add multiplayer modes where I can play with a specific friend, not just random matchmaking.\n - Add different types of and larger maps.  Not just the two-bridge design.\n - Clearly this game would be awesome on Android and iOS!\n - Address peoples' concerns over the pricing model.
