          "review": "Quick Description:\n-Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a dungeon crawling puzzler w/ a trusty dog as the star of the show.  I really wanted to like this game, and I feel like it's so close to being a really fun and challenging puzzler.  Unfortunately, this game just isn't for me.  I wish there was some accessibility options or at least some clues when you are stuck.  Since every dungeon is randomized, it can be very hard to find help from walkthroughs or forums on how to complete a given section.  \n\nWhat's Good:\n-I'm a big fan of the visual presentation and overall tone of FDR.  There is a ton of charm, silly humor, and interesting dungeons.  There are ghosts, demons, skeletons, aliens, and a few other monstrosities, but nothing is taken too seriously.  Visually, this game looks great for a small Indie game.\n-The basic mechanics are well designed and set the framework for a really challenging and interesting puzzler.  Your goal is to collect as much currency, kill as many enemies,avoid dying, and escape the dungeon.  Some stages, you will chased by a ghost, other levels force you to take a minimum amount of steps in order to advance, and all of the levels expect you to think multiple steps ahead.  \n-There are several different modes, which help keeps things fresh.  There is the standard mode, there is a daily run mode, there is a really challenging mode where are chased by a ghost every dungeon, and one or two more modes.\n\nCould Use Some Changes:\n-The biggest problem by far is that there is seemingly no way to get help if you are stuck.  There is no tutorial, there are no hints, and the dungeons are all randomized which makes it very hard to find a walkthrough that can clear things up for you.  This feels very bare bones for a puzzler, even by small Indie game standards.  I got stumped on one level where I had to kill an enemy that was attached by a chain on the opposite side of the dungeon.  I had to make specific movement choices which forced him to take damage and he could gain health by killing certain enemies.  I got him down to one health 3 different times, but for 45 straight minutes, I tried every conceivable combination, and couldn't complete the puzzle.  It's hard to improve in this game b/c I don't know what I'm supposed to do differently, and the game expects you to improve by trial and error.\n-This game is pretty rough around the edges in general.  It doesn't say how to start a specific mode at the start screen, you just have to try them all out.  The UI is a bit confusing.  It's one of the few games that I own that almost never runs at 60 fps.  Sometimes, it randomly crashes.  These are all small things, but they are still worth mentioning.\n\nConsensus:\n-Bottom Shelf Game (Tier 5 and makes up 10% of my reviews).  I hate giving negative reviews to smaller passion projects.  I really like the way this game looks visually and I'm a big fan of interesting puzzlers.  I also recognize that I only played this game for about 2.5 hrs, and most games in this genre take a few hrs to become reasonably competent.  So, it's very possible that this is a \"get gud\" situation, especially seeing how good the reviews are for this game.  However, most of my 2.5 hrs playing this game were very frustrating.  Every time I felt clever or saw some progress, I would run into an issue.  There are so many amazing puzzler and strategy games on Steam that I would recommend before this game.  For that reason, I can't recommend this.",

Although I feel it was more of something that was implimented to get around the poor procedural generation. There were several levels that didn't seem solveable without gold, which to me seems a needlessly high bar and more of something you'd put behind an achievement (ex: finish x levels without using gold). \n\nOverall, if I could give it a meh I'd give it a meh, so in lieu of that I have to give it a no. There are other games that distill the individual elements of this game much better than this game does a job of merging them into a seemlessly enjoyable experience. It was okay.",

The randomized puzzles were a bit of a turn off initially and sometimes felt unfair. But as I played the game more and tried out the other characters and other modes the game started to grow on me a lot more. \n\nYou just have to go into the game with the understanding that the game isn't about finding the perfect solution (generally), it's about finding a solution that is good enough and just moving on. In some ways this can feel unsatisfying, to not ever really get the \"aha\" moment of finding THE solution. But the game still manages to be fairly addicting and satisfying, just not in the same ways as most other traditional \"puzzle\" games.\n\nMake sure you look at the achievements for the game before thinking you are actually finished. The game has much more content than it may seem at first glance.",

          "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL97nH5EPrA\n[h1] First Impressions [/h1] \nI received Fidel Dungeon Rescue (FDR) all the way back in 2016 from a Humble Bundle monthly deal, which is somewhat strange as the game only released in 2017. I don't remember what occurred with the game, but I have it in my inventory either way, and I thought a theoretically shorter game like this would be nice to play through. Since it's a puzzle-based roguelite, I wouldn't expect it to take that long to beat, but there was only one way to find out. \n\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \nFDR uses random generation to create most of its puzzles, so that unlike many other puzzle games, it's not possible to resort to a walkthrough to mindlessly play through everything and be done with it. This is where the roguelite aspect comes in, because even though you can rewind the steps you've taken in the puzzle, it's possible to make moves that'll kill the dog. This creates an immediate time limit where you either clear the floor you're on and continue with the run, or get nabbed by the ghost and have to start from the first floor again. I find this somewhat unnecessary, as you otherwise have all the time you need to think out solutions, and can only kill the dog if you don't know how interacting with an enemy or obstacle works, or don't pay enough attention. \n\nNothing is explained in the game, so all of it has to be learned solely from your own experimentation and trial and error. There's an element of trial and error to all puzzle games, and an open mind is valuable to solve problems. However, some of the mechanics and interactions in FDR are quite specific, such as how to defeat the robot and purple dog stages and that defeating the vampires requires you to have no health. This in turn leads to puzzles that require a particular approach and solution, which you may miss completely having not figured out enough of the mechanics yet. I see many guides and videos over how things worked early on, but not so much after it updated in 2018. Having played for a few hours, I don't know quite a few things, and I've been trying all the game modes multiple times. For instance, what the benefit would be in stealing the golden face mask from the tribal warriors. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431925178\n[h1] Controls [/h1] \nIt's possible to play FDR with either a controller or keyboard, and for ease I went with a controller myself. Movement can be directed with either the 'L joystick' or 'D-pad.' To access the next floor, hit 'A.' The dog can bark with the 'R shoulder,' and you'll want to try barking at everything to find out everything it can do. 'L shoulder' rewinds your moves. There's nothing wrong with starting over from the beginning, but if you only screwed up a more recent move, don't hold that button down because you can't undo a rewind. If you have enough gold coins, you can either bomb enemies or refill all health with 'X' and 'B' respectively. \n\n\n[h1] Story [/h1] \nThere's an ending clip that plays if you beat the right game mode, potentially having to meet certain requirements. It's also possible to bring up a short opening cutscene showing an old lady being kidnapped for reasons completely unknown. Otherwise though, like everything else, there's no explanation behind what's going on or why. \n\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1] \nWith how overhead puzzle games tend to work, there's a lot of repetition because you're working with a grid system. This means that the floor tiles will be copy/pasted squares. However, there's enough detail and variety on these that no floor looks flat or bland. Some enemies have minor changes, but they're reused because of their similarities. For instance, how the red spiders will be vulnerable if you complete a triple, which is sometimes built off of the tiny, harmless spiders. Due to how enough changes are made in important areas, the game has enough novelty that the graphics are a highlight to the puzzles instead of a hindrance. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431925553\n[h1] Sound Design [/h1] \nThe music in FDR has a nice dreariness that fits the dark dungeon setting and spooky environment. They're more lively and energetic than might be expected out of a puzzle game, but I didn't find it distracting or out of place. There aren't many sound effects, though what was used seemed appropriate. Explosions had the right impact, and the haunting sound of the ghost pursuing you was eerie. \n\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1] \n🌟 There's a nice variety in puzzle elements, such as enemy types and objects that change the layout and how you approach an obstacle. For instance, XP barriers, switches, and keys. \n🌟 Unlocking the other 2 dogs gives the gameplay a nice change of pace as you play through the other game modes with their different mechanics. \n\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n❌ Although the game is pretty basic and not that demanding as it's smaller than 200 MB, it's got some technical issues. If playing in short increments, you won't notice anything, but if you play for an hour or so, there's a good chance the game will bug out. Thankfully the game will save its progress wherever you are in the moment, so closing and restarting isn't a big deal, yet I'd still expect more stability regardless. \n ❌ Supposedly each puzzle that's generated is solvable. However, there's nothing in-game that reinforces this idea, and if you get stumped you'll just have to restart the dungeon from the first floor. \n\n\n[h1] Tips [/h1]\n🔍 Unless you're attempting to earn an achievement or playing a particular mode, there's no rush in figuring out how to clear a stage in the most optimal way possible. Something that helps with pathing is to keep in mind whether the moves you're taking bar your exit, because finding a good route for coins or XP is worthless if you wind up blocked off from the exit. \n🔍 You'll want to know how much damage you take from crashing into enemies, though most do only 1 or 2 hearts of damage. That way you can avoid dying on accident, which triggers the ghost to spawn. You're allowed one courtesy death per stage in most modes, but if you die again, the ghost will pursue you, and most likely end your run. \n🔍 There's rarely a point in taking damage from an enemy if you don't get XP from it. For instance, an alert tribal warrior won't give any XP if you run into it, you only get XP if he's asleep, so you're taking damage for no gain. \n\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] \nA certain degree of my issue with FDR stems from not knowing more about how floors are randomly generated and the logic behind solving the puzzles. This is an unexpected side effect of floors not having a perfect, all-clear solution, where every item is obtainable and every enemy can be defeated, as that would resolve this problem. Even putting this issue aside, there's not very many puzzles to solve in this puzzle game, or at least not where you'd expect. The 2 adventures contain 15 and 10 levels to get through, the cemetery where you can get rid of the ghost has 4 levels, there are only 10 somewhat pre-set puzzles in puzzle mode, and the caterpillar challenge also has 10 stages. So were it not for the procedural, random nature of the puzzles artificially lengthening the content, as well as being forced to figure things out yourself, there'd be very little to actually play through in FDR. Sadly, the focus was on creating a year's worth of daily challenges for an obnoxious achievement (requires playing the game across 319 days), instead of developing more puzzles for players to solve in the other game modes. \n\n[url=https://saveorquit.com/][quote]Visit Save or Quit for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote][/url]",

I finally purchased the game on a whim, fully expecting only a few hours of fun cute simple puzzle gameplay which was totally fine by me. What I got was so much more; I absolutely ADORE this game. The visual art style, the music and sound effects, the simple but tug-at-your-heartstrings cute story!! It all FAR exceeded my expectations. The variety of enemies and mechanics, the seamless controls, the additional playable characters, daily new puzzle, and the many easter eggs make this game not only have insane replay value but be so insanely addictive too!! If you are looking for a fresh puzzle game and are loving the art style, definitely do not hesitate like I initially did. It is absolutely worth the $10. And never forget to bark. Ever!",

A wide range of unique monsters and gamemodes stretches the playtime out to several hours and greatly increases replayability.\n\nNo matter who you are or how much prior experience with puzzle-solving you have: You can rescue grandma, using your BRAIN and your BARK!\n\n(Also, please note the Trailer and preview images are somewhat outdated. The UI, sound composition, etc. have been refined well after the release date.)",

Most of the time, you'll see trivial puzzles, but then, once in a while, you'll be hit with a truly tough one. There have been many times where I opened the game for a quick daily (expecting at most 5 minutes of engagement), only to ragequit after two hours of failed attempts, unsure if that day's puzzle was solvable in the first place.\n\nIf you don't care about such things, try the game, it's really good. If you have an obsessive streak and want to 100% the game without cheating, stay away. Seriously, those dailies are driving me mad. =(",

I still have a few achievements to complete.\n\n\n",

You play as Fidel, a dog that is trying to save his elderly owner from a dark dungeon.\n\nThere's no hand-holding or tutorials, so playing can be a bit confusing at first. The way Fidel interacts with the different enemies takes a while to understand, but as you start to master these mechanics, the initial feel of \"how do I survive this level?\" transforms into a more relaxed \"how do I maximise the XP I can get out of these suckers?\". It was a great feeling when things started to click.\n\nThere are two different \"adventures\" to complete, three mini-games to master, and a whole bunch of secrets to unlock. Two of the mini games actually unlock a different version of Fidel with completely different rules of interaction - these significantly increase the replayability of the base \"adventures\".\n\nThere's also a daily challenge that has kept me coming back for 5-10 mins every day.\nDefinitely worth a try if you like puzzles, dogs, old ladies, or any combination of these.\n",

And alot of content has been added (puzzle and challenge levels). The progression is still a little weird as you have to beat the first 16 levels in a row first before it even unlocks the \"hub world\" so to speak. \n\nBut it really is a good puzzle game with a unique rouge like twist.",

The few Youtube videos of the game also never got past that point. I'm not even sure, at that stage, if there was more to the game at that time. Thankfully reinstalling it now the game has come on leaps and bounds with a much more reasonable difficulty curve, plenty of content, and the removal of that time pressure (which some players may dislike, but for those purely in it for the puzzle aspect being able to take your time is a massive boon). It also has the ability to quit at and time and resume which is a rarity in rogue-lites. Exploitable I suppose, but a nice convenience feature. The graphics and sound are both nice with a fun laidback theme. A few secrets hidden about as well as some optional 'minigames'. Recommended!",

          "review": "This is a reluctant thumbs up from me because the game is very basic yet massively overpriced. Just look at the full-price of these examples of titles with similar game-play mechanics:\n\nDots Extreme - £1.59\nHexcells - £1.99\nHexcells Plus - £1.99\nLyne - £1.99\nBlockwick 2 - £2.09\nQuell - £2.89\nQuell Momento - £2.89\nQuell Reflect - £2.89\nBurnstar - £3.99\nHexcells Infinite - £3.99\nParcel - £3.99\n\n*Slayaway Camp (£6.19) and Desktop Dungeons (£11.99) are two other quite expensive examples. The point is, £7.19 is asking a lot for this game.  \n\nThe game has solid controls and pleasant sound-effects but these features are not exactly hard to implement in a game of this nature. The art-style is of a good standard and the gameplay mechanics are enjoyable and well-varied. The best feature, for me, is the easy-on-the-ear soundtrack - very good!\n\n[u]And now the not so good:[/u]\n1. The default option has you play in a small box that's HALF the size of the screen. Why? Although you can play in a window, I could not get it to display so that it covered the full-screen as per the advertised screenshots (...you know...like almost every other game).\n\n2. It's quite unbalanced. There were times I pondered hard over the first four or five levels... but then - with little to no challenge - sped through the next three or four levels in a matter of seconds, reaching level 9 in no time. \n\n3. You are not kept that well informed and the progress system is very basic. It seems that the one and only goal is to reach Level 15. There is no home-page, no star-system, no path/level-select screen, no world or areas to explore and no stats. It's very bare-bones and lacks features even bog-standard mobile game developers include in their games. \n\nThe thing is, apart from crashes and game-breaking bugs, good and decent gameplay should trump everything else - and as FDR does manage to deliver in that department I have to recommend it on that basis - but I'd equally recommend that you DO NOT PAY THE full price and pick it up in a sale instead.\n\nFor hundreds of reviews of indie titles please check out or follow my website through my curator page at:\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26108770-Parsons%27-Garden/]Parsons' Garden[/url]",

The new updates made it easier to get some of the harder achievements, and are actually good challenges and ideas to make the game more interesting. I'm a solid 20 hours in, and I'm still getting some good variety of play in the normal and hard modes both. All in all, this is a severely underrated and unnoticed game, especially for the price. However, it is absolutely and unabashedly a puzzle game, so be ready to slow it down and figure some stuff out. I'm just saying, be sure you're into that sorta game before you buy it. Worth full price. \n\n9/10",

          "review": "I like Fidel Dungeon Rescue a lot. I revisit it once in a while to complete the daily challenge or beat the main game. It never goes on too long and is always fun.\n\nOne of it's strengths is definitely it's great replayability. Since puzzles are randomly generated, two dungeons are never the same, and it has a real impact on the gameplay. Due to the various rules of each different tiles and creatures, a slight position offset may drastically change the best path to an exit. There's also many possible solutions to most puzzles, so some thought is always required even with \"obvious\" situations.\n\nOn top of that, there's some interesting special modes. They aren't as deep as the main game, but are fun enough to complete. The one I return to the most is the daily challenge, wich is not surprising. The daily challenge is a single level that changes every day and can be completed only by finding the perfect solution. It can get pretty difficult!\n\nRegarding difficulty, I'd say it is very much a casual game. The \"hard\" mode became easy fast after I completed it once, and now that the ghost timer has been removed it's a walk in the park. The daily challenge and some achievements are now the only challenging parts of the game (to me at least). Not necessarily negative, but important nonetheless.\n\nI'd also like to mention the great pixel art and animations, as well as the very convenient save system. Whenever the game is run, it opens right where it was when last closed; I like it.\n\nAll in all, great casual puzzle game!",

It seems the difficulty of the game's initial release scared off potential buyers but multiple updates later it's much more forgiving, with even the time limit on levels entirely removed. It's still not a cakewalk though, some levels can leave you sitting for tens of minutes trying to find the perfect route.\nI bought this expecting a small Roguelike to pass the time for a while but the amount of content really provides you with a lot to do. Once you beat the initial set of levels, you're rewarded a second harder campaign, three puzzle modes, two unique characters, multiple secret achievements and a year's worth of daily challenges.\nIf you enjoy puzzle games and want a game that lasts, Fidel is an excellent choice.",

Picked it up for about $7 on launch sale, played until I beat my first run (about 6-7ish hours for the main world, which was only 40% of the game), and set it aside as a \"lunch-break\" game to be played later. \n\n[h1]If you'd asked me then how I felt about the game back then (v.1.0), I'd have said: [/h1][i]Fantastic little puzzle roguelike mix, I've never seen anything really like it. A good amount of content and replayability with an unlockable hard-mode area after you beat the main game. And puppies![/i]\n\n[h1]It's been a year since then...[/h1] ...and I've watched this little labor of love evolve into something truely special ever since.\n\n2 unlockable characters with different mechanics, 3 unlockable mini-modes (in addition to the old underworld), 1 retro minigame, and DAILIES. \n\nThis is Fidel 2.5. Not just 1.5, not even 2.0 -- [b]2.5.[/b]\n\nBuy it, even on full price, to support the outstanding post-launch content. The sheer amount of [i]content[/i] crammed into this game for it's price is rivaled only by the likes of Duet and Lyne.\n\nYou'll know in about an hour if it's the game for you. And if it is, boy are you in for a (dog) treat!",

          "review": "Fidel Dungeon Rescue is certainly the cutest dungeon crawler I have played, although it's more of a puzzle game.  You play as Fidel, a good doggo looking to help his grandma.  You work your way through levels, defeating enemies and healing damage while not crossing your leash.  Each level is essentially a new puzzle to determine how to wring out the most possible XP.\n\nIn previous versions of the game, you were on a timer to make sure you didn't take too long to dither about your route, but now that timer only kicks in if you repeatedly take on too much damage (which is eminently preventable once you know the rules of the game).  It's still possible to trigger it if you're incautious or clumsy (like me) but the game as a whole is a ton less stressful now that you can take as long to think as you need.  The levels are procedurally generated, with an algorithm that is well-tuned to make things interesting and varied.\n\nThe game has a fairly wide variety of enemies and level gimmicks.  The developer has done a impressive job of adding post-release content, including but not limited to daily challenges and two unlockable alternate dogs.  The spritework manages to balance being adorable and unsettling, and I dig the OST.  All in all, this is a gem of a game that deserves more attention.",

          "review": "Fidel is not a puzzle game for everyone. It takes the principles of Snake, gives it a nice cute pixel setting but does not explain any of the changes the developers have decided to make.\n\nThis has resulted in the game needing a basic manual, an unlockable bestiary and a visible level timer. \n\nMovement: arrows or WASD keys. Mouse is not needed for this game.\nSpace bar allows you to switch start and finish points (only found out from screen tip - naughty).\ncontrol key makes the dog bark (unknown use on early levels)\na bomb costs 3 gold and destroys enemy horizontal and vertical to you.\na health potion costs 9 gold for a full health refill when you are not near a medipack.\nyou can only hold 9 gold. (neither cost is shown up front, wallet capacity is hinted at with 9 circles)\n\nlevelling up increase your health by +1 each time. Switch XP to numbers helps you to see when you'll gain +1 HP and a free health refill.\n\nTaking too long or dying activates a countdown timer in the form of a ghost. No onscreen timer to show how long until the ghost starts to come for you. This is annoying as dying sends you back to level 1.\n\nAt no point is there an option to find out how much health each enemy takes from you unless you touch it. (Most enemies consume health when you touch them and can range from 1 heart to a full health bar). Some enemies are safe to touch from certain angles others are dangerous no matter how you touch them.\n\nThe enemies are randomly selected, so there is a chance you will encounter tougher monsters (vampires/witch doctors) when replaying an early level (level 2).\n\nI went into this game wanting to like it, but have come out feeling frustrated due to how it performs erractically.",

          "review": "Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a really clever roguelite puzzle game, or maybe a puzzle game disguised as a roguelite? Just like other roguelites, it's permadeath and randomly generated levels crawling in enemies, but the true challenge isn't getting to the exit but finding the most optimal path to get there, which is where the puzzle aspect comes in. To survive the challenges at the end of the game, you've got to make sure you get as much XP as possible, which means coming up with a winding path through each level that kills as many enemies as possible and gets extra combo XP for consecutive kills. Thankfully, this is aided by the ability to undo your moves, so you can experiment and compare different routes, trying to balance combos, health, and the need to not cross over your own path. The game doesn't really explain anything, but with careful observation you'll quickly pick up on the rules and how to beat each enemy type (Don't forget about barking though! It's useful for identifying mimics and changing the direction that turtles face).",

Jonathan Blow is credited in this game as one of 'The Elders', so I imagine that has something to do with the gameplay similarity between the two games.\n\nI bought the game on a whim because of the coupon, and I've been pleasantly surprised. The graphics are wonderfully well done. The sound design and music are really great too. The mechanics are easy to learn, but tricky to master.\n\nAlthough the surface level format of the gameplay is wildly different, Fidel has a strange amount of similarity to The Witness (in a good way). If you are a fan of those types of puzzles, but also want a game that will simultaneously scratch your dungeon-crawling itch, then this game is a good buy!",

It's a roguelike puzzle-game, with the focus on finding a way to maximize XP in ecah level by carefully plotting a path through enemies+items. It requires you to really engage with every puzzle if you want to win the game, so it may not be for everyone.\n\nGame mechanics are all simple and self-explanatory (in fact there's almost no text except for menus), but they combine to make very tricky puzzles. There's a good variety of enemies, introduced at a steady pace, who all bring a creative twist that you must account for.\n\nThe difficulty is very high, demanding you do well on every level or you won't be able to beat the later ones (especially the brutal boss levels).\n\nThe game also has a great soundtrack+aesthetics, and lots of neat extra modes you unlock once you beat the main dungeon once. (There's unlockable characters with new mechanics, hand-crafted puzzles, daily challenges, a second dungeon that functions as hard mode, another short bonus dungeon, and more). So even though the main quest isn't that long there's plenty of replay potential.\n\nI literally cannot think of a single thing I can point to as a flaw. It's not necessarily my favorite game ever, but it knows what it wants to be and every detail is perfect for getting it there.",

However, I do think it is a bit expensive for what you get. Wait to get it on sale for $5 or so unless this is your favorite genre. Everything is very streamlined and polished and I only ran into a few minor bugs and crashes while playing it. Highly recommended if you like puzzle games.\n\nEDIT: There are some negatives like the \"over 1 year of playing every day to complete achievement\" and the annoying ghost (which you can get rid of later in the game, but is still annoying). But overall, those detractors don't take enough away from a great game.",

On his way Fidel levels up by beating enemies to gain additional HP, and picks up gold to power up special abilities. Usually you can't perfectly clear a level, so the game's all about maximizing gains within a limited (by a Spelunky-like ghost appearing on the floor if the player lingers for too long) time frame. There's a good variety of enemy types and objects, often requiring a special approach to tackle them. In a standard for some roguelites fashion you aren't provided with a lot of info on the game rules, instead discovering stuff through failure. It could've been annoying in a puzzle game, but, luckily, you can always undo and retrace your steps.\n\nLevel layouts are randomly generated, but follow strict templates, which somewhat harms replayability. So floor number 4 is always the \"alien\" level and so on. On the plus side, said templates often have unique mechanics, making a single run diverse.\n\nAgain, replayability appears to be [i]Fidel's[/i] weaker point, but there're hidden levels, characters and game modes to unlock, daily challenges, decent chunk of content overall. The graphics are cute, the soundtrack is actually great, play sessions are conveniently short. Overall, a pretty good indie title.\n\n[h1]Daft Review[/h1] \n[b]Disclaimer: I was Fidel's stunt double during the making of the game. So when you see Fidel jumping through lava and eating spiders, yeah, that's actually me. [/b]\n\n[i]Fidel Dungeon Rescue [/i] is an action-packed hardcorgi simulator. Battle ghouls, chase gnomes, play chess, fetch ball,  invade hell in this 100% authentic corgi experience. An amazing adventure. A normal day in a life of a corgi.\nLadies and gentlemen, you can play as a fat corgo. Or as a robo corg. OR as a zombie puppo. There's a dedicated bark button, incredible attention to crucial detail.\nFamily-friendly game: great way for your kids to learn about the sacrifices corgis make to protect and preserve humanity. \nBe a good dog, be a bad dog, be a dead dog, all major corgi archetypes are covered in this simulator, woofin' great.",

          "review": "Fidel Dungeon Rescue is basically a puzzle roguelite that feels like it would work really well on phones, though it's PC only for now. You control a cute little dog heading through a randomly generated dungeon, I think to rescue your (human) Grandma, though there isn't much in the way of story here. Each level has you start on one set of stairs and challenges you to earn a certain amount of XP and then head down the other set. You gain XP by just walking into monsters, but each time you do so you lose a heart - walk into a monster with no hearts left and you die. Luckily, medikits are liberally sprinkled around the tile-based dungeon floor, and each one fully heals you. This would make things pretty easy, except you're trailing rope behind you so you can't cross over your own path, a bit like a turn-based Snake. On top of that, there are different enemy types who can't simply be walked into - for example, three headed turtles have to be approached from behind - traps that can be deactivated by switches and more.\n\nAs well as opening the level exit, getting enough XP will level you up, giving you an extra max heart. Levelling up before the boss levels is pretty important, so you'll want to try and get more than the minimum required XP on each level, and trying to figure out the best path is a pretty fun puzzle. You can also choose which stairway you start on, and there are coins to pick up that you can spend to instantly use a bomb or a health potion. Importantly, while you can't cross your path you can backtrack, which undoes the moves and restores your hearts/revives the monsters etc. Dying isn't immediately game over either, instead it spawns a ghost that starts at the entrance stairs and follows your path, finishing your run if it touches you. He also shows up if you take too long solving the levels, though the limit is pretty generous, at least as far as I've played - it just stops you spending forever trying every possible path. Each level is short enough that dying doesn't feel particularly punishing anyway, you can just jump straight back in.\n\nThe puzzles are all randomly generated in terms of monster and item placement, but there are a set number of level layouts that do start repeating pretty quickly. On the other hand there are also unlockables, and enough challenge that it seems to last most people about 15 hours from what I can see, and the random nature means you can always come back for more if you like it enough. The art is cute and the music is pretty good, although it doesn't do fullscreen very well. I prefer it in a window anyway, it makes a very good coffee break game. Simple to pick up and play but challenging enough to satisfy your milder puzzle cravings, Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a game I'd say is easily worth a look.",

Unique to this game is that you have infinite \"undos\" but a two-minute time limit for each level which always pushes you forward.  Each level is a very compelling logic puzzle which can seem impossible at first but is almost always solvable.  \n\nCompletion of the main game unlocks an additional 10-level \"extra-hard\" dungeon; two \"puzzle-mode\" dungeons; a 4-level \"speed run\" dungeon, a daily challege mode, and more.

Yes it looks like a mobile port (I don't know if it is) but is just as suitable for a PC (yeah whatever Linux persons/MAC droids! :p ..you too if it supports it) Bit pricey but if you can afford or during a sale/bundle, thoroughly enjoyable!\n\n[b]Don't waste more time reading lengthy reviews.. time is of the essence![/b]",

          "review": "Fidel is a fun, smart, cute looking puzzle rogue-lite. For me it was very engaging. Rules of the game, how each enemy works, one learns organically through observation & experimentation, and it's fun to figure out what new elements do. While it’s a rogue-lite, and the random can sometimes screw the player over, it’s predominantly a puzzle game, so there is much more control.\n\nThere are two \"boss\" levels (at the end of main game & underworld), which introduce several new concepts at once, but there is an endless undo, and no time limit on those, so player can take it slow discovering new mechanics and then the solution. No need to repeat whole dungeon several times to have a brief chance at the boss level, like the regular rogue-likes do it. One needs to prepare for those “bosses” though, by completing previous levels well (more XP=more HP, more coins=extra items to use). \n\nThere are also extra centipede levels, along with extra puzzle levels, that after beating unlock zombie-Fidel & robo-Fidel respectively, dog alternatives that change the gameplay significantly for further replays of the base game & underworld.\n\nAnd after all that, the player can challenge themselves by beating the game under different conditions for achievements. Personally, I’ve finished all the base & underworld floors resulting in true ending, all the centipede & puzzle levels, and then did a few successful special runs. I had a lot of fun and I’ll probably come back to it from time to time.\n\nVery much recommended :)\n\n[i]Written after 10.5 hours played & 13 of 23 (57%) achievements earned[/i]",

I wasn't expecting a DD clone, just a turn based puzzle game with monsters to attack. \n\nUnfortunately FDR wasn't any fun for me. The biggest issue for me was that the levels have a timer, a ghost that forces you to start over if it catches you. There is a \"cheat\" (developers word) that lets you turn it off, but I don't cheat in my puzzle games. There is also suppose to be a level later in the game that allows you turn turn off the ghost timer.\n\nAlso, I dislike the \"good enough\" solution to the levels. DD was tough and it forces you to be creative in how you approach levels. FDR lets you wander around and finish a level without making much of an effort. Probably I would get stuck in later levels because I didn't level up my character enough, but how good is good enough?",

The first time I played through it, I found the game to be a little too unforgiving, 9 times out of 10 I wouldn't die from a mistake I made, but from moving the wrong way by accident...But thanks to the update, the game is less unforgiving, there's loads of new content, bug fixes, and little things that were polished up, like some of the animations, effects, and even gameplay.\n\nI'd say it's totally worth the price, I thought it was high at first, especially for the game before the update, but now it's a better match for the price. I definitly recommend picking this up if a rogue-like puzzle game sounds fun to you.",

I just managed to beat the first boss and play on a bit further. I'm sure there's lots more to learn as I haven't even figured out what the bark is good for yet. It's interesting how the levels are procgen but still retain a theme, so it's different yet familiar each time you play. Also I like the pixel art, it's clear and good.",

          "review": "Fidel Dungeon Rescue is to puzzle games what Spelunky is to platformers. (To clarify, this is a very high compliment, as Spelunky is probably my favourite video game of all time.)\n\nTruthfully though, both games really do share some familiar elements and design decisions. In this game, you play a cute little dog having to rescue Grandma from a dungeon filled with all sorts of baddies. You navigate through multiple, tile-based floors, killing enemies as you go, and leaving your leash trailing behind you, blocking you from ever stepping on the same tile twice. Where the similarities to Spelunky begin are in familiar enemy motifs such as spiders, snakes or flesh-eating plants. Further similiarity arises in a time-based ghost, the randomized rogue-lite nature of the game and the strategic, yet fast-paced gameplay that Fidel's mechanics enable.\n\nLet me elaborate a little on that last one. There is no fixed \"solution\" to each level here, but rather multiple paths are available. On most floors, your main objective is simply to make it to the end of the level. But if you want grow stronger, you'll need to squash a lot of enemies, build combos and pick up coins to purchase items (health potions and bombs) to help you out in tough situations. Your enemies will always take health from you (although exceptions apply), and so you need to plan out your path through the level so that you can alternate between enemies and health packs. You can always undo your actions and retread your path, to figure out your optimal route. If you're chased by the ghost after dying and rewinding your fatal mistake, maybe that optimal route is to get to the stairs leading you to the next level as soon as possible.\n\nFidel Dungeon Rescue also is one of those games that doesn't bother with unnecessary over-tutorialization. The undo mechanic encourages experimentation, allows learning by doing and enables surprises in hidden mechanics. Again, something that it shares with Spelunky. I don't want to give off the wrong impression that due the familiar mechanics or motifs the game is derivative. No, it feels wholly original and the absolutely gorgeous artwork and hugely catchy soundtrack do a lot to help the game feel fresh and unique. I really don't want to gloss over the artwork. This is some of the nicest, most lively pixel art I've seen in quite a while - and good pixel art isn't exactly all that hard to find in indie games. But all the designs and colors and animations here - they're just really excellent and a step above the usual quality.\n\nTo sum it up, Fidel Dungeon Rescue is an elegantly, smartly designed little puzzle game. It encourages exploration, experimentation and strategy. It's difficult, but not unfair. It plays fast and is perfect for short breaks and longer sessions alike. It looks and sounds wonderful, and all that makes it one of the best games I've played this year.",

And just when you think you're done, a whole new layer unfolds for you.\n\nI just finished it, 15 hours in, but there are still a few loose ends left to tie up.\n\nAlso, it takes quite a while to understand all the nuances that are present in even the earliest levels.

Soon, you'll become experienced enough to rush through without dying, and beat the game on its normal difficulty, and that's when the real challenge begins! I haven't even beaten the unlockable hard mode, and with all of the secrets along the way, there is plenty of content to be had here, for a good price!",

Each session might last anywhere from 5-15 minutes, it's great if you're sitting down with a laptop on your lunch break or waiting for a game to download. The music is catchy and the art style is fitting. Most importantly, the developer actually cares about his game. He's asking for recomendations from the fans, updating on a regular basis, and fixing bugs that arise in his game. The game is a solid reccomendation for anyone who likes challenging puzzles, and also for people who enjoy rouge-likes such as The Binding of Isaac.",

The complexity required to make a puzzle/rougelike that works and is consistently fresh each run is executed extremely well. The game never feels unfair, every mistake is something you can see in advance.\n\nIt took me around 8 hours to complete the game in its current state, although I haven't done the extended challenges. There's definitely room for some more mechanics and ideas to be implemented, and I hope the devs are still planning on releasing a bit more content. \n\nOverall, it's a fun and short game, that doesn't get boring before you finish it. \n\nAlso, bark at everything.",

          "review": "Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a challenging puzzle game in which you move around a randomly generated dungeon of monsters without crossing your path. Everytime you \"attack\" a monster you lose some health, and everytime you move over a health pack you restore health. As you collect experience while you progress through the increasily difficult dungeon floors, you level up, causing the amount of health you have to increase, providing an incentive to maximum the experience you gain on each floor. While this may sound like a simple concept, there are enough secondary mechanics, interesting monster behaviours, and challenging trade-offs you must make to keep the gameplay varied and interesting. If you lose all your health or spent too long on a level, the ghost will appear to keep you on your toes. This provides a very fast-paced gameplay, while forcing you to pay careful attention to every move you make, even if there is an undo command.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not without its flaws. The ghost can be an annoyance to those who want to take their time, or experiment without worry of having to start all over again. Furthermore I was unable to get my controller working with the game (although I suspect things like this will be patched in the future..?). Regardless, this game is highly enjoyable and I would recommend to anyone interested in puzzle games!",

For me it's an immediate turn off and I'm not interested in playing long enough to become ghost-proof. I'd rather have an option to just disable the ghost, so no timer and instant death. Making a mistake and then trying to correct it in a handful of seconds is just not fun for me.\n\nOther than that it's actually a cute game that broadens the line puzzle concept nicely. Discovering how the different enemies work and the imperfect levels forcing you to choose are clever additions.",

Classic line drawing mechanic, combined with (mostly) stationary enemies and the \"three-in-a-row\" bonus somehow gave birth to a super compelling experience. A great example of how the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe enemies are interesting and intuitive; you pick up on their nuances quite naturally without any tiresome hand-holding. \n\nI thin it's a game you really have to try for yourself. I watched Northernlion's playthrough on YouTube and wasn't that impressed, but decided to get the game anyway. 15 mins in and I was hooked. Initially I was a little put off by the time pressure, but after awhile I began to appreciate the tension it provided. The game is not about finding the perfect solution(which often gets tedious in my opinion), and the time pressure just encourages you to move things along with a good enough solution.\n\nAlso, I'm happily exploring secrets.\n\nOverall, highly recommended.",

Design is simple, deep, full of surprise. \nThe game doesn't hand hold you and it is pretty good at conveying its rules in a natural manner.\n\nI find the music fantastic and to be perfect fit (rather unexpected for a puzzle game!), graphics are charming, the interaction are smooth and reactive, the effects and feedback are just the right amount of juicy. \n\nI guess it is more approachable than a game like The Witness (which I also loved but I think The Witness might be more overwhelming for many types of players? Just guessing).\n\nBeing able to play for short period of time is amazing, although I have to admit the \"one more go\" factor made me spend way too much time on it already!\n",

If you like either of those types of games, you're in for a treat. Fidel's design is simple, devious, and very satisfying. The art, sound, and gameplay all form a very coherent package: short and sweet, and ridiculously replayable. You may not understand what you're doing the first 10 to 15 runs, but then the game's design begins to reveal itself. That's when Fidel gets its hooks into you. I might come back to this review. I just urge you to give this a try if it piques your interest.\n\nEdit: It's still good, actually it's better.",

Each run lasts about 5-10 minutes, so dying isn't aggravating, since it's usually pretty quick to get back to where you were last run. All of the rooms feel very fair, and it's possible to progress through them without a perfect route.\n\nThe art and the sound effects are excellent, and really contribute to the feeling of joyful exploration.\n\nThere's also a good amount of replay value, since the game has plenty of optional challenges that stack on the difficulty. I found the default mode pretty easy, but the challenges get pretty tough.\n\nI recommend this game. It's a lot of fun.",

Much more of what you can see at first glance.\n\nThe game grows in complexity with the player experience, so, every time you start the game all over again, is going to be matched up to your current hability.\n\nIt will always be a great challenge, not matter how many times you finish it.\n\nEverything else is just right. Simple, but charming.\n\nI don't usually expend time writing reviews, but i actually feel that it's my duty to recommend this game! If you like challenges and puzzle games, you have to try this one!!",

          "review": "A very tight, very demanding puzzle-ish game that uses a simple, easily learnable set of mechanics to force you to make mind-destroyingly difficult decisions; getting near-perfect completions of most of the later floors requires you to think five steps ahead, but you don't have to be anywhere near perfect to progress to the next stage, which is a pretty lovely nugget of design. You gain items and health for doing earlier floors better, so performance on early floors affects your ability on later ones, and even when you can't figure out the perfect solution you're always pressured to do as well as you possibly can.\n\nThe randomly generated levels will occasionally throw you a floor you can wipe in one try out of instinct, and occasionally something that has you completely stuck, which can be demoralizing near the end of a good run. There's also a timer on each level, which I guess is there to make sure you can't be TOO cautious, but getting wrecked by a ghost when you're 3/4ths of the way through a tricky level can feel frustrating all the same. Despite these gripes, each individual puzzle is still a joy to solve. I don't know if I'll ever be able to 100% this game, but I find that just loading it up and playing a few floors is satisfying even when I don't get very far. I absolutely got the Tetris Effect going the first night I bought this, when I played it for an hour or so before bed.",

          "review": "Fidel is a fantastic, fun, and fiendishly difficult mash-up of the puzzle and rogue-lite genres. The art and music are cute, but don't let that fool you. This game is no joke and will kill you quick if you don't think about your moves before you make them. The experience of playing Fidel is a great combo of the desire to take time and strategize your way through each level, along with the time pressure that if you take too long trying to perfect your route, a ghost will show up. This aspect is obviously similar to Spelunky, and although the game takes a lot of inspiration from there, I'd say it holds its own in that comparison, with a similar level of variety and challenge. I may actually enjoy it a bit more since it doesn't have nearly the focus on reflexes that Spelunky has. \n\nOverall, I'd say it's a great game and definitely not to be missed.",

From the moment you see the opening screen for the first time, it becomes obvious that it's really well designed and polished, and absolutely charming.\n\nThe first level of each game is always as a kind of \"tutorial\" used to teach you (or, rather, to let you discover by yourself) how the different enemies behave and the best way to approach them, and after that you start descending into a dungeon of randomly generated levels.\n\nAs for the dungeon itself... it's much more rewarding if you discover for yourself everything that Fidel has to offer, but suffice to say that it's always varied, challenging and, above all, fun to play.\n\nGames usually last just a few minutes, but always manage to leave you wanting to come back for \"just another round\". \n\nOn top of all this, it's also really cheap for everything that it has to offer, so... what are you waiting for?

The only things that I don't like are some punishing mechanics, like not being able to go back if my doggy dies (I go back but the ghost always catches me), and having a time/steps (not sure) pressure to complete a level (hate that ghost). Another thing that I felt is that there is a big increase in difficulty from level 1 to level 2. On my first try it was a bit intimidating, maybe on the first try I would have liked a few intermediate levels.\nOverall a really good game, if you like exploration, pixel art and logic puzzles, definitely check it out!",

          "review": "It's not really a puzzle-puzzle game, but it does make you think alot. Kind of action puzzely. Surprising amount of depth.\n\nAlthough the gameplay is extremely different from tetris. The closest game I can think of is tetris, where you want to work out some puzzle-like stuff, while going at a pace. Therefore being a action-puzzle game.\n\nSimilar to tetris, this game have given lots of people (including me), tetris syndrome. Play it!\n\nEdit: Probably my goty 2017.\n\nEdit Edit: Some parts of this review is no longer that true because there was an update to give the player more time each level. But it's still a great game nonetheless, still dipping back for a run or two even in 2021",

          "review": "Fidel: Dungeon Rescue is a strategy/puzzle dungeon crawler in which you play a dog called Fidel who is attempting to get through the dungeon to rescue your human. There are 16 levels and each one has a different type of monster and different concepts. In order to survive, Fidel has to find the most efficient path. He cannot go back across his own trail and must try to get to the end whilst gaining as much experience and coins as possible so that later levels are easier, but with limited health and a lot of monsters in the way this can be a real challenge. Some monsters have different tactics that you need to get around them, for example the man-eating plants which need to have their flowers killed first, forcing the main plant to close so it can be killed or the three-headed turtles which can be attacked without taking damage from the tail. There is a reasonable range of opponents, with each level being quite different to the last. There are also buttons and switches, traps and walls to navigate.\n\nYou can take your time to try and find the most efficient strategical path to the exit and if you make a minor mistake you can go backwards and try again. If you die however, you have a very brief window before your ghost catches up with you to make it to the exit. Failure results in starting from the entire beginning, giving it that roguelike quality. As you progress through the level, you can unlock useable items (with coins you pick up) and level up, giving you more health - but nothing persists through death.\n\nIt's a quick game. You can play for a few minutes, die and put it down. Playing it in short bursts was the most fun for me - perfect considering I'm currently on maternity leave looking after a tiny angry human, so my choice in games lately is definitely more on the side of things that can be picked up and put down very quickly. I'd like to see this on the mobile market - I'd definitely pick this up on the iOS store.  The main downside I can see is that some people may not consider it amazing value and depending on how smart you are, this could be a fairly short game. At £5.99 it's a little more expensive than I expected and some may prefer to wait for a sale. There are also no resolution settings; although you can change the size of the window.\n\nOther than that, this is a fun, fast, casual strategy game with decent retro music.\n\n[h1]My verdict - recommended to anyone looking for a casual game that still requires a decent amount of brainpower. If I had to give it a score rating, it'd be a solid 4 / 5.[/h1]\n\n♥♥♥ If you're a weirdo who wants to follow my reviews, please clicky some links: [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28971565/]My Curator Page[/url] and [url=http://www.twitter.com/playwithath]My Twitter[/url].

          "review": "Wow, this game is fun, fast, and tricky! \nDev once said that the original inspiration for this game came when he was designing a puzzle panel for The Witness. I can see the resemblance! Finding the best path is a real joy, especially because you can take back moves after you make them so you're not just staring at a screen trying to solve the puzzle. Instead, Fidel is always adventuring, trying to find the best path, and maybe sometimes barking. \nLike all great rouge-likes, the real joy comes from understanding all of the interactions in the game. Like when I discovered if I combo three enemies in a row, the red spiders flip over, vulnerable, until another enemy is killed. \nIt's worth the money!",

It's a perfect median between very contemplative puzzle-games, and action-oriented roguelikes.",

It's also wickedly challenging, the sort of game that can be equally maddening (in a good way) and extra addictive. I wholeheartedly recommend it, especially for players who love squeezing out every bit of gameplay and hunting for secrets.\n\nFidel manages to be rewarding in a way few games can.",
