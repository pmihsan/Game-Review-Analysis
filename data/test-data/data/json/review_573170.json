I really wanted to like this game, and I feel like it's so close to being a really fun and challenging puzzler.  Unfortunately, this game just isn't for me.  I wish there was some accessibility options or at least some clues when you are stuck.  Since every dungeon is randomized, it can be very hard to find help from walkthroughs or forums on how to complete a given section.  \n\nWhat's Good:\n-I'm a big fan of the visual presentation and overall tone of FDR.  There is a ton of charm, silly humor, and interesting dungeons.  There are ghosts, demons, skeletons, aliens, and a few other monstrosities, but nothing is taken too seriously.  Visually, this game looks great for a small Indie game.\n-The basic mechanics are well designed and set the framework for a really challenging and interesting puzzler.  Your goal is to collect as much currency, kill as many enemies,avoid dying, and escape the dungeon.  Some stages, you will chased by a ghost, other levels force you to take a minimum amount of steps in order to advance, and all of the levels expect you to think multiple steps ahead.  \n-There are several different modes, which help keeps things fresh.  There is the standard mode, there is a daily run mode, there is a really challenging mode where are chased by a ghost every dungeon, and one or two more modes.\n\nCould Use Some Changes:\n-The biggest problem by far is that there is seemingly no way to get help if you are stuck.  There is no tutorial, there are no hints, and the dungeons are all randomized which makes it very hard to find a walkthrough that can clear things up for you.  This feels very bare bones for a puzzler, even by small Indie game standards.  I got stumped on one level where I had to kill an enemy that was attached by a chain on the opposite side of the dungeon.  I had to make specific movement choices which forced him to take damage and he could gain health by killing certain enemies.  I got him down to one health 3 different times, but for 45 straight minutes, I tried every conceivable combination, and couldn't complete the puzzle.  It's hard to improve in this game b/c I don't know what I'm supposed to do differently, and the game expects you to improve by trial and error.\n-This game is pretty rough around the edges in general.  It doesn't say how to start a specific mode at the start screen, you just have to try them all out.  The UI is a bit confusing.  It's one of the few games that I own that almost never runs at 60 fps.  Sometimes, it randomly crashes.  These are all small things, but they are still worth mentioning.\n\nConsensus:\n-Bottom Shelf Game (Tier 5 and makes up 10% of my reviews).  I hate giving negative reviews to smaller passion projects.  I really like the way this game looks visually and I'm a big fan of interesting puzzlers.  I also recognize that I only played this game for about 2.5 hrs, and most games in this genre take a few hrs to become reasonably competent.  So, it's very possible that this is a \"get gud\" situation, especially seeing how good the reviews are for this game.  However, most of my 2.5 hrs playing this game were very frustrating.  Every time I felt clever or saw some progress, I would run into an issue.  There are so many amazing puzzler and strategy games on Steam that I would recommend before this game.  For that reason, I can't recommend this.", "timestamp_created": 1655431748, "timestamp_updated": 1655476406, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115522927": {"recommendationid": "115522927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057092054", "num_games_owned": 3723, "num_reviews": 309, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 165, "last_played": 1652653398}, "language": "english", "review": "The rewind ability is a nice touch to make it less punishing in the short-term.

I don't remember what occurred with the game, but I have it in my inventory either way, and I thought a theoretically shorter game like this would be nice to play through. Since it's a puzzle-based roguelite, I wouldn't expect it to take that long to beat, but there was only one way to find out. \n\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \nFDR uses random generation to create most of its puzzles, so that unlike many other puzzle games, it's not possible to resort to a walkthrough to mindlessly play through everything and be done with it. This is where the roguelite aspect comes in, because even though you can rewind the steps you've taken in the puzzle, it's possible to make moves that'll kill the dog. This creates an immediate time limit where you either clear the floor you're on and continue with the run, or get nabbed by the ghost and have to start from the first floor again. I find this somewhat unnecessary, as you otherwise have all the time you need to think out solutions, and can only kill the dog if you don't know how interacting with an enemy or obstacle works, or don't pay enough attention. \n\nNothing is explained in the game, so all of it has to be learned solely from your own experimentation and trial and error. There's an element of trial and error to all puzzle games, and an open mind is valuable to solve problems. However, some of the mechanics and interactions in FDR are quite specific, such as how to defeat the robot and purple dog stages and that defeating the vampires requires you to have no health. This in turn leads to puzzles that require a particular approach and solution, which you may miss completely having not figured out enough of the mechanics yet. I see many guides and videos over how things worked early on, but not so much after it updated in 2018. Having played for a few hours, I don't know quite a few things, and I've been trying all the game modes multiple times. For instance, what the benefit would be in stealing the golden face mask from the tribal warriors. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431925178\n[h1] Controls [/h1] \nIt's possible to play FDR with either a controller or keyboard, and for ease I went with a controller myself. Movement can be directed with either the 'L joystick' or 'D-pad.' To access the next floor, hit 'A.' The dog can bark with the 'R shoulder,' and you'll want to try barking at everything to find out everything it can do. 'L shoulder' rewinds your moves. There's nothing wrong with starting over from the beginning, but if you only screwed up a more recent move, don't hold that button down because you can't undo a rewind. If you have enough gold coins, you can either bomb enemies or refill all health with 'X' and 'B' respectively. \n\n\n[h1] Story [/h1] \nThere's an ending clip that plays if you beat the right game mode, potentially having to meet certain requirements. It's also possible to bring up a short opening cutscene showing an old lady being kidnapped for reasons completely unknown. Otherwise though, like everything else, there's no explanation behind what's going on or why. \n\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1] \nWith how overhead puzzle games tend to work, there's a lot of repetition because you're working with a grid system. This means that the floor tiles will be copy/pasted squares. However, there's enough detail and variety on these that no floor looks flat or bland. Some enemies have minor changes, but they're reused because of their similarities. For instance, how the red spiders will be vulnerable if you complete a triple, which is sometimes built off of the tiny, harmless spiders. Due to how enough changes are made in important areas, the game has enough novelty that the graphics are a highlight to the puzzles instead of a hindrance. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431925553\n[h1] Sound Design [/h1] \nThe music in FDR has a nice dreariness that fits the dark dungeon setting and spooky environment. They're more lively and energetic than might be expected out of a puzzle game, but I didn't find it distracting or out of place. There aren't many sound effects, though what was used seemed appropriate. Explosions had the right impact, and the haunting sound of the ghost pursuing you was eerie. \n\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1] \n\ud83c\udf1f There's a nice variety in puzzle elements, such as enemy types and objects that change the layout and how you approach an obstacle. For instance, XP barriers, switches, and keys. \n\ud83c\udf1f Unlocking the other 2 dogs gives the gameplay a nice change of pace as you play through the other game modes with their different mechanics. \n\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n\u274c Although the game is pretty basic and not that demanding as it's smaller than 200 MB, it's got some technical issues. If playing in short increments, you won't notice anything, but if you play for an hour or so, there's a good chance the game will bug out. Thankfully the game will save its progress wherever you are in the moment, so closing and restarting isn't a big deal, yet I'd still expect more stability regardless. \n\u274c Supposedly each puzzle that's generated is solvable. However, there's nothing in-game that reinforces this idea, and if you get stumped you'll just have to restart the dungeon from the first floor. \n\n\n[h1] Tips [/h1]\n\ud83d\udd0d Unless you're attempting to earn an achievement or playing a particular mode, there's no rush in figuring out how to clear a stage in the most optimal way possible. Something that helps with pathing is to keep in mind whether the moves you're taking bar your exit, because finding a good route for coins or XP is worthless if you wind up blocked off from the exit. \n\ud83d\udd0d You'll want to know how much damage you take from crashing into enemies, though most do only 1 or 2 hearts of damage. That way you can avoid dying on accident, which triggers the ghost to spawn. You're allowed one courtesy death per stage in most modes, but if you die again, the ghost will pursue you, and most likely end your run. \n\ud83d\udd0d There's rarely a point in taking damage from an enemy if you don't get XP from it. For instance, an alert tribal warrior won't give any XP if you run into it, you only get XP if he's asleep, so you're taking damage for no gain. \n\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] \nA certain degree of my issue with FDR stems from not knowing more about how floors are randomly generated and the logic behind solving the puzzles. This is an unexpected side effect of floors not having a perfect, all-clear solution, where every item is obtainable and every enemy can be defeated, as that would resolve this problem. Even putting this issue aside, there's not very many puzzles to solve in this puzzle game, or at least not where you'd expect. The 2 adventures contain 15 and 10 levels to get through, the cemetery where you can get rid of the ghost has 4 levels, there are only 10 somewhat pre-set puzzles in puzzle mode, and the caterpillar challenge also has 10 stages. So were it not for the procedural, random nature of the puzzles artificially lengthening the content, as well as being forced to figure things out yourself, there'd be very little to actually play through in FDR. Sadly, the focus was on creating a year's worth of daily challenges for an obnoxious achievement (requires playing the game across 319 days), instead of developing more puzzles for players to solve in the other game modes. \n\n[url=https://saveorquit.com/][quote]Visit Save or Quit for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1617399155, "timestamp_updated": 1617399195, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647891759872436523", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86763100": {"recommendationid": "86763100", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992706495", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 627, "last_played": 1534406222}, "language": "english", "review": "You play as a dog.

Two of the mini games actually unlock a different version of Fidel with completely different rules of interaction - these significantly increase the replayability of the base \"adventures\".\n\nThere's also a daily challenge that has kept me coming back for 5-10 mins every day.\nDefinitely worth a try if you like puzzles, dogs, old ladies, or any combination of these.\n", "timestamp_created": 1572254970, "timestamp_updated": 1572254970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55605379": {"recommendationid": "55605379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035182410", "num_games_owned": 1038, "num_reviews": 344, "playtime_forever": 714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1630608846}, "language": "english", "review": "When this game originally released it was barely playable.

I revisit it once in a while to complete the daily challenge or beat the main game. It never goes on too long and is always fun.\n\nOne of it's strengths is definitely it's great replayability. Since puzzles are randomly generated, two dungeons are never the same, and it has a real impact on the gameplay. Due to the various rules of each different tiles and creatures, a slight position offset may drastically change the best path to an exit. There's also many possible solutions to most puzzles, so some thought is always required even with \"obvious\" situations.\n\nOn top of that, there's some interesting special modes. They aren't as deep as the main game, but are fun enough to complete. The one I return to the most is the daily challenge, wich is not surprising. The daily challenge is a single level that changes every day and can be completed only by finding the perfect solution. It can get pretty difficult!\n\nRegarding difficulty, I'd say it is very much a casual game. The \"hard\" mode became easy fast after I completed it once, and now that the ghost timer has been removed it's a walk in the park. The daily challenge and some achievements are now the only challenging parts of the game (to me at least). Not necessarily negative, but important nonetheless.\n\nI'd also like to mention the great pixel art and animations, as well as the very convenient save system.

Usually you can't perfectly clear a level, so the game's all about maximizing gains within a limited (by a Spelunky-like ghost appearing on the floor if the player lingers for too long) time frame. There's a good variety of enemy types and objects, often requiring a special approach to tackle them. In a standard for some roguelites fashion you aren't provided with a lot of info on the game rules, instead discovering stuff through failure. It could've been annoying in a puzzle game, but, luckily, you can always undo and retrace your steps.\n\nLevel layouts are randomly generated, but follow strict templates, which somewhat harms replayability.

You control a cute little dog heading through a randomly generated dungeon, I think to rescue your (human) Grandma, though there isn't much in the way of story here. Each level has you start on one set of stairs and challenges you to earn a certain amount of XP and then head down the other set. You gain XP by just walking into monsters, but each time you do so you lose a heart - walk into a monster with no hearts left and you die. Luckily, medikits are liberally sprinkled around the tile-based dungeon floor, and each one fully heals you. This would make things pretty easy, except you're trailing rope behind you so you can't cross over your own path, a bit like a turn-based Snake. On top of that, there are different enemy types who can't simply be walked into - for example, three headed turtles have to be approached from behind - traps that can be deactivated by switches and more.\n\nAs well as opening the level exit, getting enough XP will level you up, giving you an extra max heart. Levelling up before the boss levels is pretty important, so you'll want to try and get more than the minimum required XP on each level, and trying to figure out the best path is a pretty fun puzzle. You can also choose which stairway you start on, and there are coins to pick up that you can spend to instantly use a bomb or a health potion. Importantly, while you can't cross your path you can backtrack, which undoes the moves and restores your hearts/revives the monsters etc. Dying isn't immediately game over either, instead it spawns a ghost that starts at the entrance stairs and follows your path, finishing your run if it touches you. He also shows up if you take too long solving the levels, though the limit is pretty generous, at least as far as I've played - it just stops you spending forever trying every possible path. Each level is short enough that dying doesn't feel particularly punishing anyway, you can just jump straight back in.\n\nThe puzzles are all randomly generated in terms of monster and item placement, but there are a set number of level layouts that do start repeating pretty quickly. On the other hand there are also unlockables, and enough challenge that it seems to last most people about 15 hours from what I can see, and the random nature means you can always come back for more if you like it enough. The art is cute and the music is pretty good, although it doesn't do fullscreen very well. I prefer it in a window anyway, it makes a very good coffee break game. Simple to pick up and play but challenging enough to satisfy your milder puzzle cravings, Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a game I'd say is easily worth a look.", "timestamp_created": 1529080750, "timestamp_updated": 1529081222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567617654800415039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42167716": {"recommendationid": "42167716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025196133", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 4430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3609, "last_played": 1608680712}, "language": "english", "review": "Neat hybrid puzzle/roguelike game.

While it\u2019s a rogue-lite, and the random can sometimes screw the player over, it\u2019s predominantly a puzzle game, so there is much more control.\n\nThere are two \"boss\" levels (at the end of main game & underworld), which introduce several new concepts at once, but there is an endless undo, and no time limit on those, so player can take it slow discovering new mechanics and then the solution. No need to repeat whole dungeon several times to have a brief chance at the boss level, like the regular rogue-likes do it. One needs to prepare for those \u201cbosses\u201d though, by completing previous levels well (more XP=more HP, more coins=extra items to use). \n\nThere are also extra centipede levels, along with extra puzzle levels, that after beating unlock zombie-Fidel & robo-Fidel respectively, dog alternatives that change the gameplay significantly for further replays of the base game & underworld.\n\nAnd after all that, the player can challenge themselves by beating the game under different conditions for achievements. Personally, I\u2019ve finished all the base & underworld floors resulting in true ending, all the centipede & puzzle levels, and then did a few successful special runs. I had a lot of fun and I\u2019ll probably come back to it from time to time.\n\nVery much recommended :)\n\n[i]Written after 10.5 hours played & 13 of 23 (57%) achievements earned[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1517865725, "timestamp_updated": 1517865725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757603943347930908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39819737": {"recommendationid": "39819737", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987561734", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 703, "last_played": 1671910253}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing games for 25 years now and Fidel is way up there among my favorites.

(To clarify, this is a very high compliment, as Spelunky is probably my favourite video game of all time.)\n\nTruthfully though, both games really do share some familiar elements and design decisions. In this game, you play a cute little dog having to rescue Grandma from a dungeon filled with all sorts of baddies. You navigate through multiple, tile-based floors, killing enemies as you go, and leaving your leash trailing behind you, blocking you from ever stepping on the same tile twice. Where the similarities to Spelunky begin are in familiar enemy motifs such as spiders, snakes or flesh-eating plants. Further similiarity arises in a time-based ghost, the randomized rogue-lite nature of the game and the strategic, yet fast-paced gameplay that Fidel's mechanics enable.\n\nLet me elaborate a little on that last one. There is no fixed \"solution\" to each level here, but rather multiple paths are available. On most floors, your main objective is simply to make it to the end of the level. But if you want grow stronger, you'll need to squash a lot of enemies, build combos and pick up coins to purchase items (health potions and bombs) to help you out in tough situations. Your enemies will always take health from you (although exceptions apply), and so you need to plan out your path through the level so that you can alternate between enemies and health packs. You can always undo your actions and retread your path, to figure out your optimal route. If you're chased by the ghost after dying and rewinding your fatal mistake, maybe that optimal route is to get to the stairs leading you to the next level as soon as possible.\n\nFidel Dungeon Rescue also is one of those games that doesn't bother with unnecessary over-tutorialization. The undo mechanic encourages experimentation, allows learning by doing and enables surprises in hidden mechanics. Again, something that it shares with Spelunky. I don't want to give off the wrong impression that due the familiar mechanics or motifs the game is derivative. No, it feels wholly original and the absolutely gorgeous artwork and hugely catchy soundtrack do a lot to help the game feel fresh and unique. I really don't want to gloss over the artwork. This is some of the nicest, most lively pixel art I've seen in quite a while - and good pixel art isn't exactly all that hard to find in indie games.

Everytime you \"attack\" a monster you lose some health, and everytime you move over a health pack you restore health. As you collect experience while you progress through the increasily difficult dungeon floors, you level up, causing the amount of health you have to increase, providing an incentive to maximum the experience you gain on each floor. While this may sound like a simple concept, there are enough secondary mechanics, interesting monster behaviours, and challenging trade-offs you must make to keep the gameplay varied and interesting. If you lose all your health or spent too long on a level, the ghost will appear to keep you on your toes. This provides a very fast-paced gameplay, while forcing you to pay careful attention to every move you make, even if there is an undo command.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not without its flaws. The ghost can be an annoyance to those who want to take their time, or experiment without worry of having to start all over again.

You gain items and health for doing earlier floors better, so performance on early floors affects your ability on later ones, and even when you can't figure out the perfect solution you're always pressured to do as well as you possibly can.\n\nThe randomly generated levels will occasionally throw you a floor you can wipe in one try out of instinct, and occasionally something that has you completely stuck, which can be demoralizing near the end of a good run.

There are 16 levels and each one has a different type of monster and different concepts. In order to survive, Fidel has to find the most efficient path. He cannot go back across his own trail and must try to get to the end whilst gaining as much experience and coins as possible so that later levels are easier, but with limited health and a lot of monsters in the way this can be a real challenge. Some monsters have different tactics that you need to get around them, for example the man-eating plants which need to have their flowers killed first, forcing the main plant to close so it can be killed or the three-headed turtles which can be attacked without taking damage from the tail. There is a reasonable range of opponents, with each level being quite different to the last. There are also buttons and switches, traps and walls to navigate.\n\nYou can take your time to try and find the most efficient strategical path to the exit and if you make a minor mistake you can go backwards and try again. If you die however, you have a very brief window before your ghost catches up with you to make it to the exit. Failure results in starting from the entire beginning, giving it that roguelike quality. As you progress through the level, you can unlock useable items (with coins you pick up) and level up, giving you more health - but nothing persists through death.\n\nIt's a quick game. You can play for a few minutes, die and put it down. Playing it in short bursts was the most fun for me - perfect considering I'm currently on maternity leave looking after a tiny angry human, so my choice in games lately is definitely more on the side of things that can be picked up and put down very quickly. I'd like to see this on the mobile market - I'd definitely pick this up on the iOS store.  The main downside I can see is that some people may not consider it amazing value and depending on how smart you are, this could be a fairly short game. At \u00a35.99 it's a little more expensive than I expected and some may prefer to wait for a sale. There are also no resolution settings; although you can change the size of the window.\n\nOther than that, this is a fun, fast, casual strategy game with decent retro music.\n\n[h1]My verdict - recommended to anyone looking for a casual game that still requires a decent amount of brainpower. If I had to give it a score rating, it'd be a solid 4 / 5.[/h1]\n\n\u2665\u2665\u2665 If you're a weirdo who wants to follow my reviews, please clicky some links: [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28971565/]My Curator Page[/url] and [url=http://www.twitter.com/playwithath]My Twitter[/url].

La mec\u00e1nica de juego de Fidel consiste en trazar el mejor camino para superar cada nivel, intentando eliminar a la mayor cantidad de monstruos en el proceso. Lo interesante es que cada enemigo tiene una forma espec\u00edfica para ser derrotado y parte del encanto es descubrir como hacerlo, aunque para ello debamos morir una y otra vez. Aqu\u00ed no hay tutoriales ni indicaciones que nos lleven de la mano y es por eso que la muerte no se siente como un castigo, porque al momento de volver a comenzar una nueva partida habremos aprendido algo nuevo que nos permitir\u00e1 llegar cada vez mas lejos. Cabe destacar que no es un juego especialmente largo, aunque llegar al final tomar\u00e1 su tiempo, no solo porque cada fase -la cual est\u00e1 generada proceduralmente- sea un rompecabezas en si misma, sino porque Fidel esconde muchos secretos y niveles especiales que aportan un plus al conjunto.
