131299060, beautiful visuals argentinean dev and tight game design (only has the exact elements it needs to work nicely)\n\ni used to get extremely frustrated at this game but recently the dev implemented a more forgiving death mechanic and it's much much better!\n\ngo for it!

117103951, Quick Description:\n-Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a dungeon crawling puzzler w/ a trusty dog as the star of the show.  I really wanted to like this game and I feel like it's so close to being a really fun and challenging puzzler.  Unfortunately this game just isn't for me.  I wish there was some accessibility options or at least some clues when you are stuck.  Since every dungeon is randomized it can be very hard to find help from walkthroughs or forums on how to complete a given section.  \n\nWhat's Good:\n-I'm a big fan of the visual presentation and overall tone of FDR.  There is a ton of charm silly humor and interesting dungeons.  There are ghosts demons skeletons aliens and a few other monstrosities but nothing is taken too seriously.  Visually this game looks great for a small Indie game.\n-The basic mechanics are well designed and set the framework for a really challenging and interesting puzzler.  Your goal is to collect as much currency kill as many enemiesavoid dying and escape the dungeon.  Some stages you will chased by a ghost other levels force you to take a minimum amount of steps in order to advance and all of the levels expect you to think multiple steps ahead.  \n-There are several different modes which help keeps things fresh.  There is the standard mode there is a daily run mode there is a really challenging mode where are chased by a ghost every dungeon and one or two more modes.\n\nCould Use Some Changes:\n-The biggest problem by far is that there is seemingly no way to get help if you are stuck.  There is no tutorial there are no hints and the dungeons are all randomized which makes it very hard to find a walkthrough that can clear things up for you.  This feels very bare bones for a puzzler even by small Indie game standards.  I got stumped on one level where I had to kill an enemy that was attached by a chain on the opposite side of the dungeon.  I had to make specific movement choices which forced him to take damage and he could gain health by killing certain enemies.  I got him down to one health 3 different times but for 45 straight minutes I tried every conceivable combination and couldn't complete the puzzle.  It's hard to improve in this game b/c I don't know what I'm supposed to do differently and the game expects you to improve by trial and error.\n-This game is pretty rough around the edges in general.  It doesn't say how to start a specific mode at the start screen you just have to try them all out.  The UI is a bit confusing.  It's one of the few games that I own that almost never runs at 60 fps.  Sometimes it randomly crashes.  These are all small things but they are still worth mentioning.\n\nConsensus:\n-Bottom Shelf Game (Tier 5 and makes up 10% of my reviews).  I hate giving negative reviews to smaller passion projects.  I really like the way this game looks visually and I'm a big fan of interesting puzzlers.  I also recognize that I only played this game for about 2.5 hrs and most games in this genre take a few hrs to become reasonably competent.  So it's very possible that this is a get gud situation especially seeing how good the reviews are for this game.  However most of my 2.5 hrs playing this game were very frustrating.  Every time I felt clever or saw some progress I would run into an issue.  There are so many amazing puzzler and strategy games on Steam that I would recommend before this game.  For that reason I can't recommend this.
115522927, The rewind ability is a nice touch to make it less punishing in the short-term. Although I feel it was more of something that was implimented to get around the poor procedural generation. There were several levels that didn't seem solveable without gold which to me seems a needlessly high bar and more of something you'd put behind an achievement (ex: finish x levels without using gold). \n\nOverall if I could give it a meh I'd give it a meh so in lieu of that I have to give it a no. There are other games that distill the individual elements of this game much better than this game does a job of merging them into a seemlessly enjoyable experience. It was okay.
115229726, Find your way through obstacles no real combat puzzle dungeon crawler? The idea sounds interesting but for me it's simply no fun to play :(.
111994019, Very well made hard to master. Fun.
