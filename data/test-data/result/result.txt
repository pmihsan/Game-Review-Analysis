{"id": "117103951", "review": "Quick Description:\n-Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a dungeon crawling puzzler w/ a trusty dog as the star of the show.  I really wanted to like this game, and I feel like it\"s so close to being a really fun and challenging puzzler.  Unfortunately, this game just isn\"t for me.  I wish there was some accessibility options or at least some clues when you are stuck.  Since every dungeon is randomized, it can be very hard to find help from walkthroughs or forums on how to complete a given section.  \n\nWhat\"s Good:\n-I\"m a big fan of the visual presentation and overall tone of FDR.  There is a ton of charm, silly humor, and interesting dungeons.  There are ghosts, demons, skeletons, aliens, and a few other monstrosities, but nothing is taken too seriously.  Visually, this game looks great for a small Indie game.\n-The basic mechanics are well designed and set the framework for a really challenging and interesting puzzler.  Your goal is to collect as much currency, kill as many enemies,avoid dying, and escape the dungeon.  Some stages, you will chased by a ghost, other levels force you to take a minimum amount of steps in order to advance, and all of the levels expect you to think multiple steps ahead.  \n-There are several different modes, which help keeps things fresh.  There is the standard mode, there is a daily run mode, there is a really challenging mode where are chased by a ghost every dungeon, and one or two more modes.\n\nCould Use Some Changes:\n-The biggest problem by far is that there is seemingly no way to get help if you are stuck.  There is no tutorial, there are no hints, and the dungeons are all randomized which makes it very hard to find a walkthrough that can clear things up for you.  This feels very bare bones for a puzzler, even by small Indie game standards.  I got stumped on one level where I had to kill an enemy that was attached by a chain on the opposite side of the dungeon.  I had to make specific movement choices which forced him to take damage and he could gain health by killing certain enemies.  I got him down to one health 3 different times, but for 45 straight minutes, I tried every conceivable combination, and couldn\"t complete the puzzle.  It\"s hard to improve in this game b/c I don\"t know what I\"m supposed to do differently, and the game expects you to improve by trial and error.\n-This game is pretty rough around the edges in general.  It doesn\"t say how to start a specific mode at the start screen, you just have to try them all out.  The UI is a bit confusing.  It\"s one of the few games that I own that almost never runs at 60 fps.  Sometimes, it randomly crashes.  These are all small things, but they are still worth mentioning.\n\nConsensus:\n-Bottom Shelf Game (Tier 5 and makes up 10% of my reviews).  I hate giving negative reviews to smaller passion projects.  I really like the way this game looks visually and I\"m a big fan of interesting puzzlers.  I also recognize that I only played this game for about 2.5 hrs, and most games in this genre take a few hrs to become reasonably competent.  So, it\"s very possible that this is a "get gud" situation, especially seeing how good the reviews are for this game.  However, most of my 2.5 hrs playing this game were very frustrating.  Every time I felt clever or saw some progress, I would run into an issue.  There are so many amazing puzzler and strategy games on Steam that I would recommend before this game.  For that reason, I can\"t recommend this.", "game_id": "573170"}

There were several levels that didn"t seem solveable without gold, which to me seems a needlessly high bar and more of something you"d put behind an achievement (ex: finish x levels without using gold). \n\nOverall, if I could give it a meh I"d give it a meh, so in lieu of that I have to give it a no. There are other games that distill the individual elements of this game much better than this game does a job of merging them into a seemlessly enjoyable experience.

The randomized puzzles were a bit of a turn off initially and sometimes felt unfair. But as I played the game more and tried out the other characters and other modes the game started to grow on me a lot more. \n\nYou just have to go into the game with the understanding that the game isn\"t about finding the perfect solution (generally), it\"s about finding a solution that is good enough and just moving on. In some ways this can feel unsatisfying, to not ever really get the "aha" moment of finding THE solution. But the game still manages to be fairly addicting and satisfying, just not in the same ways as most other traditional "puzzle" games.\n\nMake sure you look at the achievements for the game before thinking you are actually finished.

{"id": "89592531", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL97nH5EPrA\n[h1] First Impressions [/h1] \nI received Fidel Dungeon Rescue (FDR) all the way back in 2016 from a Humble Bundle monthly deal, which is somewhat strange as the game only released in 2017. I don"t remember what occurred with the game, but I have it in my inventory either way, and I thought a theoretically shorter game like this would be nice to play through. Since it"s a puzzle-based roguelite, I wouldn"t expect it to take that long to beat, but there was only one way to find out. \n\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \nFDR uses random generation to create most of its puzzles, so that unlike many other puzzle games, it"s not possible to resort to a walkthrough to mindlessly play through everything and be done with it. This is where the roguelite aspect comes in, because even though you can rewind the steps you"ve taken in the puzzle, it"s possible to make moves that"ll kill the dog. This creates an immediate time limit where you either clear the floor you"re on and continue with the run, or get nabbed by the ghost and have to start from the first floor again. I find this somewhat unnecessary, as you otherwise have all the time you need to think out solutions, and can only kill the dog if you don"t know how interacting with an enemy or obstacle works, or don"t pay enough attention. \n\nNothing is explained in the game, so all of it has to be learned solely from your own experimentation and trial and error. There"s an element of trial and error to all puzzle games, and an open mind is valuable to solve problems. However, some of the mechanics and interactions in FDR are quite specific, such as how to defeat the robot and purple dog stages and that defeating the vampires requires you to have no health. This in turn leads to puzzles that require a particular approach and solution, which you may miss completely having not figured out enough of the mechanics yet. I see many guides and videos over how things worked early on, but not so much after it updated in 2018. Having played for a few hours, I don"t know quite a few things, and I"ve been trying all the game modes multiple times. For instance, what the benefit would be in stealing the golden face mask from the tribal warriors. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431925178\n[h1] Controls [/h1] \nIt"s possible to play FDR with either a controller or keyboard, and for ease I went with a controller myself. Movement can be directed with either the "L joystick" or "D-pad." To access the next floor, hit "A." The dog can bark with the "R shoulder," and you"ll want to try barking at everything to find out everything it can do. "L shoulder" rewinds your moves. There"s nothing wrong with starting over from the beginning, but if you only screwed up a more recent move, don"t hold that button down because you can"t undo a rewind. If you have enough gold coins, you can either bomb enemies or refill all health with "X" and "B" respectively. \n\n\n[h1] Story [/h1] \nThere"s an ending clip that plays if you beat the right game mode, potentially having to meet certain requirements. It"s also possible to bring up a short opening cutscene showing an old lady being kidnapped for reasons completely unknown. Otherwise though, like everything else, there"s no explanation behind what"s going on or why. \n\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1] \nWith how overhead puzzle games tend to work, there"s a lot of repetition because you"re working with a grid system. This means that the floor tiles will be copy/pasted squares. However, there"s enough detail and variety on these that no floor looks flat or bland. Some enemies have minor changes, but they"re reused because of their similarities. For instance, how the red spiders will be vulnerable if you complete a triple, which is sometimes built off of the tiny, harmless spiders. Due to how enough changes are made in important areas, the game has enough novelty that the graphics are a highlight to the puzzles instead of a hindrance. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2431925553\n[h1] Sound Design [/h1] \nThe music in FDR has a nice dreariness that fits the dark dungeon setting and spooky environment. They"re more lively and energetic than might be expected out of a puzzle game, but I didn"t find it distracting or out of place. There aren"t many sound effects, though what was used seemed appropriate. Explosions had the right impact, and the haunting sound of the ghost pursuing you was eerie. \n\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1] \n🌟 There"s a nice variety in puzzle elements, such as enemy types and objects that change the layout and how you approach an obstacle. For instance, XP barriers, switches, and keys. \n🌟 Unlocking the other 2 dogs gives the gameplay a nice change of pace as you play through the other game modes with their different mechanics. \n\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n❌ Although the game is pretty basic and not that demanding as it"s smaller than 200 MB, it"s got some technical issues. If playing in short increments, you won"t notice anything, but if you play for an hour or so, there"s a good chance the game will bug out. Thankfully the game will save its progress wherever you are in the moment, so closing and restarting isn"t a big deal, yet I"d still expect more stability regardless. \n❌ Supposedly each puzzle that"s generated is solvable. However, there"s nothing in-game that reinforces this idea, and if you get stumped you"ll just have to restart the dungeon from the first floor. \n\n\n[h1] Tips [/h1]\n🔍 Unless you"re attempting to earn an achievement or playing a particular mode, there"s no rush in figuring out how to clear a stage in the most optimal way possible. Something that helps with pathing is to keep in mind whether the moves you"re taking bar your exit, because finding a good route for coins or XP is worthless if you wind up blocked off from the exit. \n🔍 You"ll want to know how much damage you take from crashing into enemies, though most do only 1 or 2 hearts of damage. That way you can avoid dying on accident, which triggers the ghost to spawn. You"re allowed one courtesy death per stage in most modes, but if you die again, the ghost will pursue you, and most likely end your run. \n🔍 There"s rarely a point in taking damage from an enemy if you don"t get XP from it. For instance, an alert tribal warrior won"t give any XP if you run into it, you only get XP if he"s asleep, so you"re taking damage for no gain. \n\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] \nA certain degree of my issue with FDR stems from not knowing more about how floors are randomly generated and the logic behind solving the puzzles. This is an unexpected side effect of floors not having a perfect, all-clear solution, where every item is obtainable and every enemy can be defeated, as that would resolve this problem. Even putting this issue aside, there"s not very many puzzles to solve in this puzzle game, or at least not where you"d expect. The 2 adventures contain 15 and 10 levels to get through, the cemetery where you can get rid of the ghost has 4 levels, there are only 10 somewhat pre-set puzzles in puzzle mode, and the caterpillar challenge also has 10 stages. So were it not for the procedural, random nature of the puzzles artificially lengthening the content, as well as being forced to figure things out yourself, there"d be very little to actually play through in FDR. Sadly, the focus was on creating a year"s worth of daily challenges for an obnoxious achievement (requires playing the game across 319 days), instead of developing more puzzles for players to solve in the other game modes. \n\n[url=https://saveorquit.com/][quote]Visit Save or Quit for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote][/url]", "game_id": "573170"}

The art-style is of a good standard and the gameplay mechanics are enjoyable and well-varied. The best feature, for me, is the easy-on-the-ear soundtrack - very good!\n\n[u]And now the not so good:[/u]\n1. The default option has you play in a small box that"s HALF the size of the screen. Why? Although you can play in a window, I could not get it to display so that it covered the full-screen as per the advertised screenshots (...you know...like almost every other game).\n\n2. It"s quite unbalanced. There were times I pondered hard over the first four or five levels... but then - with little to no challenge - sped through the next three or four levels in a matter of seconds, reaching level 9 in no time. \n\n3. You are not kept that well informed and the progress system is very basic. It seems that the one and only goal is to reach Level 15. There is no home-page, no star-system, no path/level-select screen, no world or areas to explore and no stats. It"s very bare-bones and lacks features even bog-standard mobile game developers include in their games. \n\nThe thing is, apart from crashes and game-breaking bugs, good and decent gameplay should trump everything else - and as FDR does manage to deliver in that department I have to recommend it on that basis - but I"d equally recommend that you DO NOT PAY THE full price and pick it up in a sale instead.\n\nFor hundreds of reviews of indie titles please check out or follow my website through my curator page at:\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26108770-Parsons%27-Garden/]Parsons" Garden[/url]", "game_id": "573170"}

It never goes on too long and is always fun.\n\nOne of it\"s strengths is definitely it\"s great replayability. Since puzzles are randomly generated, two dungeons are never the same, and it has a real impact on the gameplay. Due to the various rules of each different tiles and creatures, a slight position offset may drastically change the best path to an exit. There\"s also many possible solutions to most puzzles, so some thought is always required even with "obvious" situations.\n\nOn top of that, there\"s some interesting special modes. They aren\"t as deep as the main game, but are fun enough to complete. The one I return to the most is the daily challenge, wich is not surprising. The daily challenge is a single level that changes every day and can be completed only by finding the perfect solution. It can get pretty difficult!\n\nRegarding difficulty, I\"d say it is very much a casual game. The "hard" mode became easy fast after I completed it once, and now that the ghost timer has been removed it\"s a walk in the park. The daily challenge and some achievements are now the only challenging parts of the game (to me at least). Not necessarily negative, but important nonetheless.\n\nI\"d also like to mention the great pixel art and animations, as well as the very convenient save system.

You control a cute little dog heading through a randomly generated dungeon, I think to rescue your (human) Grandma, though there isn"t much in the way of story here. Each level has you start on one set of stairs and challenges you to earn a certain amount of XP and then head down the other set. You gain XP by just walking into monsters, but each time you do so you lose a heart - walk into a monster with no hearts left and you die. Luckily, medikits are liberally sprinkled around the tile-based dungeon floor, and each one fully heals you. This would make things pretty easy, except you"re trailing rope behind you so you can"t cross over your own path, a bit like a turn-based Snake. On top of that, there are different enemy types who can"t simply be walked into - for example, three headed turtles have to be approached from behind - traps that can be deactivated by switches and more.\n\nAs well as opening the level exit, getting enough XP will level you up, giving you an extra max heart. Levelling up before the boss levels is pretty important, so you"ll want to try and get more than the minimum required XP on each level, and trying to figure out the best path is a pretty fun puzzle. You can also choose which stairway you start on, and there are coins to pick up that you can spend to instantly use a bomb or a health potion. Importantly, while you can"t cross your path you can backtrack, which undoes the moves and restores your hearts/revives the monsters etc. Dying isn"t immediately game over either, instead it spawns a ghost that starts at the entrance stairs and follows your path, finishing your run if it touches you. He also shows up if you take too long solving the levels, though the limit is pretty generous, at least as far as I"ve played - it just stops you spending forever trying every possible path. Each level is short enough that dying doesn"t feel particularly punishing anyway, you can just jump straight back in.\n\nThe puzzles are all randomly generated in terms of monster and item placement, but there are a set number of level layouts that do start repeating pretty quickly. On the other hand there are also unlockables, and enough challenge that it seems to last most people about 15 hours from what I can see, and the random nature means you can always come back for more if you like it enough. The art is cute and the music is pretty good, although it doesn"t do fullscreen very well. I prefer it in a window anyway, it makes a very good coffee break game.

{"id": "39874900", "review": "Fidel is a fun, smart, cute looking puzzle rogue-lite. For me it was very engaging. Rules of the game, how each enemy works, one learns organically through observation & experimentation, and it\"s fun to figure out what new elements do. While it’s a rogue-lite, and the random can sometimes screw the player over, it’s predominantly a puzzle game, so there is much more control.\n\nThere are two "boss" levels (at the end of main game & underworld), which introduce several new concepts at once, but there is an endless undo, and no time limit on those, so player can take it slow discovering new mechanics and then the solution. No need to repeat whole dungeon several times to have a brief chance at the boss level, like the regular rogue-likes do it. One needs to prepare for those “bosses” though, by completing previous levels well (more XP=more HP, more coins=extra items to use). \n\nThere are also extra centipede levels, along with extra puzzle levels, that after beating unlock zombie-Fidel & robo-Fidel respectively, dog alternatives that change the gameplay significantly for further replays of the base game & underworld.\n\nAnd after all that, the player can challenge themselves by beating the game under different conditions for achievements. Personally, I’ve finished all the base & underworld floors resulting in true ending, all the centipede & puzzle levels, and then did a few successful special runs. I had a lot of fun and I’ll probably come back to it from time to time.\n\nVery much recommended :)\n\n[i]Written after 10.5 hours played & 13 of 23 (57%) achievements earned[/i]", "game_id": "573170"}

There is also suppose to be a level later in the game that allows you turn turn off the ghost timer.\n\nAlso, I dislike the "good enough" solution to the levels.

{"id": "36481533", "review": "Fidel Dungeon Rescue is to puzzle games what Spelunky is to platformers. (To clarify, this is a very high compliment, as Spelunky is probably my favourite video game of all time.)\n\nTruthfully though, both games really do share some familiar elements and design decisions. In this game, you play a cute little dog having to rescue Grandma from a dungeon filled with all sorts of baddies. You navigate through multiple, tile-based floors, killing enemies as you go, and leaving your leash trailing behind you, blocking you from ever stepping on the same tile twice. Where the similarities to Spelunky begin are in familiar enemy motifs such as spiders, snakes or flesh-eating plants. Further similiarity arises in a time-based ghost, the randomized rogue-lite nature of the game and the strategic, yet fast-paced gameplay that Fidel\"s mechanics enable.\n\nLet me elaborate a little on that last one. There is no fixed "solution" to each level here, but rather multiple paths are available. On most floors, your main objective is simply to make it to the end of the level. But if you want grow stronger, you\"ll need to squash a lot of enemies, build combos and pick up coins to purchase items (health potions and bombs) to help you out in tough situations. Your enemies will always take health from you (although exceptions apply), and so you need to plan out your path through the level so that you can alternate between enemies and health packs. You can always undo your actions and retread your path, to figure out your optimal route. If you\"re chased by the ghost after dying and rewinding your fatal mistake, maybe that optimal route is to get to the stairs leading you to the next level as soon as possible.\n\nFidel Dungeon Rescue also is one of those games that doesn\"t bother with unnecessary over-tutorialization. The undo mechanic encourages experimentation, allows learning by doing and enables surprises in hidden mechanics. Again, something that it shares with Spelunky. I don\"t want to give off the wrong impression that due the familiar mechanics or motifs the game is derivative. No, it feels wholly original and the absolutely gorgeous artwork and hugely catchy soundtrack do a lot to help the game feel fresh and unique. I really don\"t want to gloss over the artwork. This is some of the nicest, most lively pixel art I\"ve seen in quite a while - and good pixel art isn\"t exactly all that hard to find in indie games. But all the designs and colors and animations here - they\"re just really excellent and a step above the usual quality.\n\nTo sum it up, Fidel Dungeon Rescue is an elegantly, smartly designed little puzzle game. It encourages exploration, experimentation and strategy. It\"s difficult, but not unfair. It plays fast and is perfect for short breaks and longer sessions alike. It looks and sounds wonderful, and all that makes it one of the best games I\"ve played this year.", "game_id": "573170"}

{"id": "34099115", "review": "Fidel Dungeon Rescue is a challenging puzzle game in which you move around a randomly generated dungeon of monsters without crossing your path. Everytime you "attack" a monster you lose some health, and everytime you move over a health pack you restore health. As you collect experience while you progress through the increasily difficult dungeon floors, you level up, causing the amount of health you have to increase, providing an incentive to maximum the experience you gain on each floor. While this may sound like a simple concept, there are enough secondary mechanics, interesting monster behaviours, and challenging trade-offs you must make to keep the gameplay varied and interesting. If you lose all your health or spent too long on a level, the ghost will appear to keep you on your toes. This provides a very fast-paced gameplay, while forcing you to pay careful attention to every move you make, even if there is an undo command.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not without its flaws. The ghost can be an annoyance to those who want to take their time, or experiment without worry of having to start all over again. Furthermore I was unable to get my controller working with the game (although I suspect things like this will be patched in the future..?).

You gain items and health for doing earlier floors better, so performance on early floors affects your ability on later ones, and even when you can"t figure out the perfect solution you"re always pressured to do as well as you possibly can.\n\nThe randomly generated levels will occasionally throw you a floor you can wipe in one try out of instinct, and occasionally something that has you completely stuck, which can be demoralizing near the end of a good run. There"s also a timer on each level, which I guess is there to make sure you can"t be TOO cautious, but getting wrecked by a ghost when you"re 3/4ths of the way through a tricky level can feel frustrating all the same. Despite these gripes, each individual puzzle is still a joy to solve.

I"m also still not sure what the last item that you get when you collect coins does.\n\nIn any case, extremely recommended game. Now if you excuse me, I *know* I"m going to beat it on the next run...", "game_id": "573170"}
{"id": "33975525", "review": "It"s not really a puzzle-puzzle game, but it does make you think alot. Kind of action puzzely. Surprising amount of depth.\n\nAlthough the gameplay is extremely different from tetris. The closest game I can think of is tetris, where you want to work out some puzzle-like stuff, while going at a pace. Therefore being a action-puzzle game.\n\nSimilar to tetris, this game have given lots of people (including me), tetris syndrome. Play it!\n\nEdit: Probably my goty 2017.\n\nEdit Edit: Some parts of this review is no longer that true because there was an update to give the player more time each level. But it"s still a great game nonetheless, still dipping back for a run or two even in 2021", "game_id": "573170"}
{"id": "33974657", "review": "Fidel: Dungeon Rescue is a strategy/puzzle dungeon crawler in which you play a dog called Fidel who is attempting to get through the dungeon to rescue your human. There are 16 levels and each one has a different type of monster and different concepts. In order to survive, Fidel has to find the most efficient path. He cannot go back across his own trail and must try to get to the end whilst gaining as much experience and coins as possible so that later levels are easier, but with limited health and a lot of monsters in the way this can be a real challenge. Some monsters have different tactics that you need to get around them, for example the man-eating plants which need to have their flowers killed first, forcing the main plant to close so it can be killed or the three-headed turtles which can be attacked without taking damage from the tail. There is a reasonable range of opponents, with each level being quite different to the last. There are also buttons and switches, traps and walls to navigate.\n\nYou can take your time to try and find the most efficient strategical path to the exit and if you make a minor mistake you can go backwards and try again. If you die however, you have a very brief window before your ghost catches up with you to make it to the exit. Failure results in starting from the entire beginning, giving it that roguelike quality. As you progress through the level, you can unlock useable items (with coins you pick up) and level up, giving you more health - but nothing persists through death.\n\nIt"s a quick game. You can play for a few minutes, die and put it down. Playing it in short bursts was the most fun for me - perfect considering I"m currently on maternity leave looking after a tiny angry human, so my choice in games lately is definitely more on the side of things that can be picked up and put down very quickly. I"d like to see this on the mobile market - I"d definitely pick this up on the iOS store.  The main downside I can see is that some people may not consider it amazing value and depending on how smart you are, this could be a fairly short game. At £5.99 it"s a little more expensive than I expected and some may prefer to wait for a sale. There are also no resolution settings; although you can change the size of the window.\n\nOther than that, this is a fun, fast, casual strategy game with decent retro music.\n\n[h1]My verdict - recommended to anyone looking for a casual game that still requires a decent amount of brainpower. If I had to give it a score rating, it"d be a solid 4 / 5.[/h1]\n\n♥♥♥ If you"re a weirdo who wants to follow my reviews, please clicky some links: [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28971565/]My Curator Page[/url] and [url=http://www.twitter.com/playwithath]My Twitter[/url].

I can see the resemblance! Finding the best path is a real joy, especially because you can take back moves after you make them so you"re not just staring at a screen trying to solve the puzzle. Instead, Fidel is always adventuring, trying to find the best path, and maybe sometimes barking. \nLike all great rouge-likes, the real joy comes from understanding all of the interactions in the game.

{"id": "113418773", "review": "Отличная игра, сочетающая в себе рогалик и головоломку. С рогаликом всё понятно, а головоломка заключается в том, что подземелья разбиты на равные участки (клетки 7х7), и вы можете встать на каждый из них только один раз. Более того, за вами тянется поводок, который не может пересекаться (как в змейке). Таким образом, ваш путь извилист и уникален, вследствие чего нужно продумывать каждый ход.\nИграете же вы за весёлого пса, который хочет спасти свою хозяйку, бабушку-божий одуванчик. В каждом подземелье ему надо проложить путь до выхода. Мешать ему это сделать будут не только ловушки, но и разнообразные монстры, расставленные по клеткам. Вставая на место монстра, вы его уничтожаете, но теряете одно сердечко. Восполнять вы их можете за счёт аптечек, до которых ещё нужно добраться. Так и продумываете ходы, рассчитывая скольких вы монстров можете убить, чтобы добраться до ближайшей аптечки и выбраться из подземелья. Если сердечек не осталось, и вы два раза столкнулись с врагом, вас начинает преследовать призрак, идущий вслед за вами, по поводку. Как только он вас настигнет, начнёте уровень сначала. Враги же интересны тем, что к каждому из них нужен свой подход. К одним нужно заходить сзади, к другим можно подойти только уничтожив несколько монстров подряд, что послабее, и далее в таком же духе. Монстров много и вариаций их истребления не меньше.\nСамое интересное, что вы всегда можете сделать ход назад, неограниченное количество раз. Хоть до самого входа в подземелье можете вернуться. Это оказуаливает игру, но не отменяет того, что нужно продумывать дальнейший ход. Просто прощупывать путь можно не в голове, а на практике. Есть и другие элементы, упрощающие геймплей. Например, поменять местами вход и выход, если вдруг посчитали, что с другой стороны вам удобнее просчитать путь. Или что вы скажете на то, что выйдя с игры, а потом зайдя в неё вы приятно удивитесь, обнаружив вашего пса на той же самой позиции, на которой он и оставался стоять. Игра всеми фибрами души дружелюбна к игроку. Учитывая эти факторы, можно сказать, что игра очень хорошо подходит как таймкиллер. Но не всё так радужно. В игре есть бонусные уровни, ставящие ряд условий для прохождения. Например, вас сразу преследует призрак , что подгоняет вас и не даёт времени для долгих раздумий. Вот с ними показуалить уже не получится:-)\nВ общем, игра хорошая, с красивым пиксельным визуалом, отличной музыкой и интересным геймплеем. Правда ценник высоковат за такую игру.

{"id": "87609750", "review": "Игра про пса, похожего на корги, который спасает свою хозяйку (старушенцию) из подземелья. По жанру - пазл+рогалик. Игра небольшая и симпатичная, умеренной сложности, идеально подходящая для кофе-брейков. Игровые сессии - по 10-15 минут. Контента тут немного, поэтому берите на распродаже.\n\nВ основном уровни небольшие, 7*7 клеток. Задача - проложить маршрут, от входа до лестницы на следующий уровень. За собакеном тянется поводок, который нельзя пересекать. Т.е. механика “змейки”. На уровне сидит куча злобных монстров, которых нужно жрать, получая опыт и теряя здоровье. Для восполнения здоровья разбросаны аптечки. Также присутствуют монетки и сундуки золота (иногда это мимик), за золото можно купить бомбу или восстановление здоровья. Все просто и интуитивно понятно.\nДелает игру интересной то, что у многих монстров есть какие-то хитрые дополнительные правила. Например, черепах надо жрать с хвоста. Вампиры приносят кучу опыта, если их убивать с пустыми сердечками (без здоровья). Красные пауки требуют, чтобы мы предварительно сожрали трех любых монстров подряд, и т.д. Новые монстры и новые правила появляются чуть ли не каждый уровень. Правила не объясняются, но разобраться самому несложно, в этом основной фан.\nНе очень понятно, кстати, создаются эти карты случайным генератором или задизайнены вручную. Я склоняюсь к последнему варианту, из-за малого размера карт… ну или вариации есть, но очень небольшие, косметические. То есть каждое прохождение уровни немножко разные, но в целом их последовательность повторяется.\nИгра также отличается невероятной дружелюбностью к игроку! Можно вернуться на любое количество ходов назад - REWIND. Даже к стартовой позиции. (Разрабы позиционируют это чуть ли не как главную фишку.) Можно менять местами вход и выход (клавиша Enter), если кажется, что с другой стороны будет удобнее строить маршрут. Можно в любой момент закрыть окошко с игрой, при следующем открытии будет автоматически восстановлена та же позиция. Супер! Stress-free game. Погибнуть тут можно, только если пару раз на уровне убить собакена и недостаточно быстро отменить ход. Тогда появляется злобный призрак, который летит в нашу сторону, если долетит - убивает пса уже насовсем. Эта фишка взята из [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/418530/]Spelunky[/url].\nВ общем-то, если решать уровни аккуратно, выстраивать оптимальный маршрут и не тупить, можно пройти все основные карты с первого же захода. Их не очень много :( Есть еще бонусные уровни. Но они более замороченные и стрессовые. Какие-то требуют проходить несколько карт подряд. Или проходить на время. Или с самого начала появляется убивающий собаку призрак. Но это уже не игра для перерыва на кофе, к сожалению. А на полноценную она никак не тянет.\nЕсли Фидель понравился, советую посмотреть [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/]The Witness[/url], там очень похожие паззловины. Такие же квадратные сетки со змейками, объектами и хитрыми правилами, которые надо разгадывать самостоятельно.

{"id": "59074404", "review": "Fidel Dungeon Rescue es un entretenido y desafiante videojuego desarrollado por un equipo de programadores independientes liderados por Daniel Benmergui, el reconocido autor de títulos como Iwish i were the Moon o Today i die.\n\nDefinido por sus responsables como un puzzle-crawler, en Fidel asumiremos el rol de un simpático can, el cual deberá adentrarse en una peligrosa mazmorra para rescatar a una tierna abuelita. La mecánica de juego de Fidel consiste en trazar el mejor camino para superar cada nivel, intentando eliminar a la mayor cantidad de monstruos en el proceso. Lo interesante es que cada enemigo tiene una forma específica para ser derrotado y parte del encanto es descubrir como hacerlo, aunque para ello debamos morir una y otra vez. Aquí no hay tutoriales ni indicaciones que nos lleven de la mano y es por eso que la muerte no se siente como un castigo, porque al momento de volver a comenzar una nueva partida habremos aprendido algo nuevo que nos permitirá llegar cada vez mas lejos. Cabe destacar que no es un juego especialmente largo, aunque llegar al final tomará su tiempo, no solo porque cada fase -la cual está generada proceduralmente- sea un rompecabezas en si misma, sino porque Fidel esconde muchos secretos y niveles especiales que aportan un plus al conjunto. Fidel Dungeon Rescue es un videojuego original, rápido y atrapante, con un apartado artístico muy notable y sin tiempos de carga, cuya única pretención es la de divertir y estrujarnos el cerebro pensando la mejor forma de superar cada escenario ¡Ah, y sos un perrito! ¡Recomendado!\n\nLo Bueno:\n+Original y desafiante.\n+Variedad de mecánicas y niveles.\n+La mezcla de géneros funciona bien,\n+Sos un perrito.\n\nLo Malo:\n-Después de unas horas se pierde la sensación de aleatoriedad.", "game_id": "573170"}

Muchos niveles maquiavélicos para inspeccionar incitándote a terminarlos al 100%, divertidos personajes caninos con habilidades distintivas, entre estos, un protagonista del cual te hace encariñar. El genial estilo de música que sabe cuando cambiar de ritmo para intensificar la situación. El arte pixel está tan bien mostrado en los enemigos y demás detalles del entorno.

As such I can"t really recommend it as it"s current iteration.\n\nHere"s the problem. This is a game that wants to be 10-12 players, but it"s only really interesting for 2 of them. Because of that, they made it two player only and filled the rest with bots. Problem solved right? Not really. This is a behavior simulator, and now one player isn"t trying to behave like he"s a normal every day person. He"s trying to behave like he"s a normal every day bot, because the bots can"t do much better. It"s unnatural, and doesn"t really fit with the theme of the game.\n\nThe problem is with the underlying premise of the game. If they could improve the game play for the other dozen or so innocent actors and give them something else to do, something else to accomplish, then maybe this game could have more than 2 players and feel much better than it is. Until then, it"s not going to achieve anything near the level of intrigue of Town of Salem, or anything similar.\n\nI hope the developers take this to heart, and find some direction to improve this.", "game_id": "329070"}

{"id": "127131118", "review": "I wish i could give this game neither a thumbs up or down, but something in the middle. The gameplay is super fun, I have played with my husband who also has this game, and a few people in the public lobbies. I really want to play with friends since my husband isn\"t the biggest fan of this game, but there\"s no way I am gonna ask them to buy a $25 game when it\"s honestly worth $10 max. I would say the price tag is okay if it actually had functioning AI for single person play, but at this time it doesn\"t. Also of course it\"s still in early access, so some models look unfinished and the lobby is BARE bones. I really hope that for the $25 I paid I can at least get a second key or something (like "It Takes Two", which was $30 and had 10+ hours of stunning gameplay) so I feel like I got my money\"s worth out of such a bare bones overpriced game. I normally wouldn\"t leave a review that\"s this critical, but I am doing it out of love. I love this game, I want my friends to play with me so they too can love this game!! But for $25 per person that can\"t happen. Put it on sale please. Sorry :\\", "game_id": "329070"}

In other words, the graphics are "cartoony". The biggest advantage of this graphic is the minimum PC requirements. I\"d say it\"ll run on Windows XP, or my grandfather\"s computer. You should be able to run it at a playable FPS.\n\nThe gameplay is fricking fun and it\"s even more fun with a friend. One of you is a Spy and the other is a Sniper. The Spy needs to complete all or some of the missions within a time limit, which can be increased. The Sniper must control any mistakes made by the Spy and be aware of his surroundings.\n\nAudio is no longer a miracle at all. The game only features Ambience sounds, and the sounds of the Spy when he tries to do something with the Double Agent. In short, there\"s no audiorgasm to be found here.\n\nThe difficulty of this game is supernaturally hard. It may look like a walk in the park in the videos, but the opposite is true. You need to come up with clever tactics for the Spy, or fool the Spy as the Sniper.\n\nGrind is more or less zero.\n\nEach game usually lasts under 5 minutes.\n\nThe price is extremely high for me. After all, the game is a bit dead. So it\"s good to have a friend who will get the game, or has already gotten it.\n\n𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐀𝐋 𝐉𝐔𝐃𝐆𝐄𝐌𝐄𝐍𝐓:\nSpyParty is a great game. Like a really great game.

{"id": "116664988", "review": "In my professional opinion. The game is over asking price with no ability to "invite" a friend using only one copy of the game, meaning that you are forced to get "two" copies of the game to be able to play with another person. The developer has mentioned that an implementation of "copies" have been in development for over 4 years but has yet to be integrated. \n\nThe other reason why the developer hasn\"t lowered the price after so many years is due to the game "not ready for an influx of players" which I find quite ridiculous since the player base has been declining and no more than 6-18 players are active at a time. \n\nI ONLY RECOMMEND this game if it was affordable at a price point of 10$-15$ MAX for an indie game but other than that I would hold off until maybe 2032? if and when the developer decides to reduce the price.\n\nGraphics: 2 out of 10 | SIMS 2001 Graphics\nFun: 9 out of 10 | Very good 1v1 for newcomers but pros at this game will ruin the fun\nLearning curve: 3 out of 10 | Mechanics are easy and even my cat learn how to play\nPrice: 0 out of 10 | Not affordable for many especially foreign countries where the US dollar outweighs their currency.\n\nOverall: It\"s an okay game but not a must have. Replayability is there for those who want a quick game (around 2-5 minutes) but not much more in terms of updates, poor dev support, overpriced. \n\nP.S: If you\"re the dev reading this.

{"id": "116332150", "review": "If it seems like it"ll be your thing, boy will it be your thing. An infinitely replayable and deep 1v1 game of strategy, bluff, memory, deception and skill where the experience of playing versus an opponent is an ever shifting and evolving meta beyond any RTS or strategy game I"ve played, based on trying to outwit your opponent and stay ahead and subvert their expectations of you. \n\nThere"s literally nothing quite like it. I find some of the negative reviews this game gets to be unfair, or at least misleading, and will attempt to explain why I feel this way. Though its clear that for this game to be "for you" may have a few criteria, mainly that you"re either interested in diving into the discord community and competitive scene, or you"re willing to gift it to a friend or convince them to buy, and you"re confident you"ll have plenty of opportunities to play with them.\n\nCommon negative reviews and comments on forums are: \n\n1) its too expensive. The developers say this is specifically to discourage too large an influx of players until they feel its ready. I"m sceptical this is needed personally, but regardless, this is a game that, if its for you and you have someone to play with, could easily net you thousands of hours of fun. For hours per dollar that ain"t half bad. The value estimation of this game often gets attributed to the amount of "content" or how "simple" the premise is, which doesn"t really tell the whole story with the game"s potential, since its depth and amount of content comes as much from your opponent as it does the mechanics or maps.\n\n2) No updates in a long while. I"ve heard covid has hampered development, and it has been a long while since the last update, however its clear from their discord the devs are still active and invested in the game. But regardless, as much as I"d like to see more content, its like bemoaning chess doesn"t have enough content, enough differently designed boards, new pieces and new mechanics. What they have already is a pretty much infinitely playable competitive game that"s as complicated and has enough content that it needs to. It is in my view far and above enough content for you and a friend to play for many years to come, both improving and learning each others game, the skill ceiling is in the stratosphere and in some respects having too much new content would risk breaking the competitive perfection of design.\n\nLike adding a new chess piece into the game of chess, more content in terms of mechanics is not necessarily a good thing, and certainly not a deal breaker. That"s not to say new maps wouldn"t be great, but there"s a good sized collection already I can"t imagine myself tiring of, and in some ways appreciate that my improving at the game can be focused to a non intimidating but solid collection of maps. There may be bugs here and there but the game seems well balanced and solid enough in terms of polish for the most part.\n\nIt"s also an experience you literally can"t get anywhere else, and paying a bit of a  premium for something so utterly unique is ok by me.\n\n3) Low player count. This could potentially be a problem, if you don"t have at least one friend to play with and you"d both be willing to commit to playing it regularly. There"s a pretty cool, friendly, inviting and vibrant discord community and competitive scene, so there are ways to easily find games, but just logging into the lobby is probably going to leave you waiting to get into matches a bit too often. If you have a friend to play with, however, this could be something you both continue to play and enjoy for a decade and there"ll likely never come a point where you think you"ve gotten as good as you can be, and will be a constant neverending shift in the meta as you both try and work against your opponent"s knowledge of your strategies and habits to try and get the upper hand. Even with a set amount of mechanics or maps, the landscape of your games against each other will change constantly and you"ll never be in a rut otherwise you"ll be losing.\n\nIf you have someone to play with, and are not relying on randoms on the internet to play -- or are interested into getting into the competitive scene, then this game is a rich enough 1v1 PVP experience with such a great amount of strategy and skill to develop to keep you invested in playing matches for many years. In my case, I"m limited by my friend"s availability to play, and am not really interested in competitive or random online play for fear of widening our skill gap too much, otherwise I imagine I"d have a play time in the many many hundreds at least, if not thousands. I can"t imagine myself ever of having my fill.\n\nAlso, once you know the game well enough from playing yourself, then the competitive scene provides endless entertainment as its an extremely watchable game. I"m not a sports fan, and don"t really watch competitive gaming at all, however for the first time I found such a thrill watching casters commentate pro-level games, its pretty enthralling to watch as well as informative.", "game_id": "329070"}

As the spy, I feel mischievous and it"s more entertaining to me to outsmart the sniper. When playing as the sniper, you"ve got to use your knowledge of being a spy to find any way to catch them out, and perhaps that means the best snipers will always beat the best spies.

{"id": "99054683", "review": "I"ll start out by saying that SpyParty is a great game, and I am a huge fan of the whole concept. It"s unique, it"s fun, and it"s a great social deduction experience for two people. It"s not too simple, it"s not too complex, and the rounds tend to last just long enough. Based on the gameplay alone, I would wholeheartedly recommend SpyParty. \n\nSo why do I not recommend this game? First, a brief bit of context: a friend of mine showed me this game years ago, around 2013. So I bought it, way back in the beta, and the two of us played it regularly and had a blast. That friend moved away around 2015 and we lost contact. \n\nWhy am I telling you this? Well, guess what I haven"t been able to do ever since my friend moved away in 2015? Play SpyParty. My played time speaks for itself. In the past 6 years, I have managed to play TWO ROUNDS of SpyParty (both on the same day). \n\nThere"s just straight up not enough people to play with. And the reason there"s no one to play with is pretty obvious, and people have been saying it in reviews ever since the game was first brought to Steam: This game is just too damn expensive for what it is. You"re paying $25 for a game with 16 peak players in the past month. $25 for a game, that if you want to play with your friends, will cost [i]them[/i] $25. This game has never gone on sale. There"s no kind of deal for buying more than one copy. It"s never included in any promotions. Nothing. And it"s not even because the developer abandoned the game! They posted an update on the game 11 hours before I made this review.\n\nSpyParty is one of the biggest missed opportunities I"ve ever seen in gaming. This game has the potential to be insanely popular, but the $25 cost per person just completely cripples the game. You simply cannot gate off a social deduction game like this and expect it to succeed. It just does not work. It [i]astounds[/i] me the amount of potential that is just being left on the table here, solely because the developer insists on charging $25 for a game that"s been in beta for nearly a decade.\n\nSo should you spend $25 on SpyParty? Depends. If you have a friend that"s willing to also spend $25 on a copy and play with you, the game"s a blast! But if you"re looking to buy a single copy of this game, and play by yourself, don"t bother. There is no one online to play with you.", "game_id": "329070"}

An extraordinary amount of depth that takes a short time to become competent in, but will take a very long time to master.

{"id": "89339632", "review": "Most important thing, this game is not playable. It is essentially multiplayer only but has an almost non-existent playerbase. Expect to wait upwards of an hour for a game. The only ~10-20 active players that actually play this game have their own discord server that they have to post in to find games. Ontop of this, there is no actual lobby/searching system, you have to just invite people to play.\n\nThis is entirely a casual game of the like of among us with extremely little content, as the vast majority claim it should be much cheaper, it is comparable to a £5 game, not a £20 game. It does not have anywhere near the content or depth to justify this pricetag.\n\nDespite what the dev and the extremely small playerbase claim, there is no competive depth, at all, to this game. As the playerbase is extremely small with no matchmaking, the people I have played against have hundreds of hours in this game, while I have around 10 minutes (the playtime of 4 hours is almost entirely waiting for games), despite this I have won more games than I have lost. On top of this I have spectated "top" players of this game from the sniper side and manage to quite often tell (with certainty) who the spy is before they do. This should make it incredibly obvious how little depth this game actually has. Imagine if someone who had played 10 minutes of chess could spot a forced mate before Magnus Carlsen (the reality is it"s even worse than that, as the person actually playing has more tools available to them than the person just spectating, it"s more compable to someone that had played 10 minutes of chess spotting a forced mate before Magnus Carlsen while also only being able to see half the pieces), or someone that had played 10 minutes of chess winning games more often than losing when playing against people with hundreds of hours.\n\nFinally, this game is NOT early access, no matter what is claimed. It has been public for a decade (well before the steam early access), and there is no actual updates to it. The last update to it that was anything other than a bugfix was almost 2 years ago, and it was just a small map. There has not been a single major update to it since it came to steam early access 3 years ago. It is clear this game will always be in the very poor alpha state it is in. That a multiplayer only game has been public for over a decade and still does not have as much as a search for game function is preposterous.\n\nSave your money.", "game_id": "329070"}

{"id": "84875903", "review": "this game is a 10/10.\nso why the poor review?\nthe game is a competitive game, not a casual game. for some reason though, the game starts you out with a tutorial that leaves out the action tests and all the complexity and magic in the game, in an attempt to make it more approachable. unfortunately, this is a completely spectacular failure. so the casuals play it, and theres just really nothing special there for them. then, the tryhards have to figure out for themselves that there is a secret complex fun mode to the game with the action tests, or somebody else tells them. with the 25$ price tag (which is justified by the quality and depth of the game), this is why the community for the game is so small. no one knows.\nso even if you do get passed that hump, there"s 2 more major pitfalls. 1, there is no matchmaking. It"s just a lobby and you have to invite people to play against you, usually it"s just empty anyway. so good luck getting a game.\nthen the biggest problem is that the whole community just loves to rope for god knows why. it"s so unbearable. the players who will play you in the game will want to play you in a round, and then watch an entire replay of the whole round to analyze it before playing the next round. they"ll even do it in tournament, which is just preposterous. In no other competition in the entire world is it normal for the competitors to sit and watch a replay of the round they just played before continuing to the next round. it"s just bizarre, and what"s the justification for it, that the game is complex?? Just imagine if a chess professional asked his opponent to wait in tournament, while he goes back and analyzes the match they just played before starting the next.\nthis is a really sad review, because the game itself is actually a 10/10. but its a competitive game and it"s really not for casuals, but for some reason the dev is intent on selling the game to casuals. in reality the game just ends up shoving away all the casuals and then most people who would tryhard the game don"t even get to find out that it"s a complex game because the dev just wants to cater to casuals, for some reason. i swear the dev for this game literally doesn"t want to make money or something, it"s like a passion project or something. \nif you are a competitive player and like complex games, and don"t mind having your face roped off, this is the game for you. I"m absolutely still gonna tune into the streams of the tournament matches, because when you are watching instead of playing they skip ahead and you aren"t getting roped. The production quality is amazing for such a small community and the level of play at the top is really spectacular. i highly recommend tuning into spypartyfans, look it up on youtube or twitch. it"s sad, because this game could be so much more popular than it is, but there are systems in place to prevent that from happening.", "game_id": "329070"}

{"id": "83924886", "review": "SpyParty is not a PvP, or at least in the way you"d expect if you play online games a lot. Yes, you play online against other human beings, but there"s no tangible reward you accumulate for playing; no points, no cosmetics, no game passes, or ranks even. You also can"t just log in and queue up into a random game immediately, as there isn"t an auto-matchmaking system yet, so you need to seek out other online people in a lobby and challenge them to play, like an old-school online strategy game server.\n\nThe closest game I can compare SpyParty to is Chess. Your reward for playing is that you get to enjoy a deeply strategic and psychological experience with your opponent. Or maybe the reward is that you get to become a better player and develop a more masterful play style alongside a great community of people also looking to grow. Or if you want, your goal can be to work up to tournament play and win competitive matches (there"s a SpyParty Discord Server with occasional tournaments). Watching commentated matches on Twitch is surprisingly enjoyable.\n\nLike Chess, the game is so deep that it will feel really imbalanced if you play against someone much more or much less experienced than you. There are ways to handicap either player, but it works best if you find someone to play with that"s at a similar level, so you can grow your skillset together. This is the main downside to the game. However, when you"re in the lobby looking for people to play with, you can see how many games they"ve won, and challenge someone with a similar number as you, which is a pretty decent indicator for skill level in my experience. And if you like to ask questions or play against more seasoned players as a learning experience, the Discord server has many generous and kind folks to help out.\n\nIf you just appreciate the silly concept of pretending to be a spy at a party, and want to see what that"s like, that"s also a totally legit reason to play, though the $25 may not be as justifiable.\n\nIn any case, Happy SpyPartying!", "game_id": "329070"}

Even if you completely ignore the community (Which you absolutely should NOT!), SpyParty is an incredibly deep and interesting game that I still find myself learning about to this day. \n\nThe crux of most reviews here on steam come down to this; the idea that SpyParty is not worth 25$. And maybe they"re right, if what you"re looking for is a goofy party game to play with your friend. It functions well as that sort of game, but you"ll be dropping 50$ on two accounts to do that. And for most people, that isn"t worth it. But if you"re really interested in the concept and the game itself? 25$ is a steal.

This is a single game mode of a single afternoon of snipping your friends pretending to be AI, where if you look at 4 of your friends, each have to shell out 25USD in a total of 100USD.\n\nIn 2011 you thought the price of 25USD is fair for a game like this, maybe to help the dev come up off their cocaine highs but in 2020 after being hit by COVID, 25USD gets you a large pizza 3 toppings 10 pcs chicken wings and 4 drinks and 2 fucking dips and you don\"t even have to go outside, order that for your friend anywhere in the world and you may avoid getting fucked by greedy developers. \n\nTo reiterate:\n\nDwarf Fortress: >10 years monk-dev, free\nAurora 4X (2004): >10 years hobby-dev, engine rework in 2020 under C#, free\nAI-or-Sniper(2011): >9 years goblin-dev, 10 minute gameplay, for the price of 40 Chicken Nuggets.", "game_id": "329070"}

{"id": "71246062", "review": "Okay, so I never ever never write game reviews on steam. Until now, because SpyParty is such a great game, and I want to maybe get some people who treat the game like a party game to view it from a different angle, and to briefly sum up what the game is, and what it isn\"t.\n\n\nThe gameplay/content:\n\nThe spy is hiding in the party, while the sniper tries to discern them from the innocent partygoers. So far, so easy; especially since when booting up the game for the first time, you will be presented with a severely simplified experience, as to not overwhelm a new player. Then new missions for the spy to complete, as well as fresh venues to play on will be unlocked after a certain number of wins, to gradually deepen the experience. \nAt 40 wins you will be presented with the standard mode of the game, at which point you will realize that every mission just got a lot more complicated for the sniper to track, because now there are different variations of the missions avaliable, dependent on the outcome of a so called "action test" from the spy.\nThus the true depth of the game only unravels after already playing it for quite a while, but I wouldn\"t consider this a flaw, as it enables new players to gradually ease into the full experience.\nYou really don\"t have to be concerned about there not being enough depth to the game, I have played this game for about 400 hours and I still don\"t really see myself as an incredibly advanced player. This game is hard. But it also rewards you for putting in some effort and understanding how it really works.\n\nThe point that I am trying to make is the following: You can see this game as a party game. If you do, you will get some enjoyment out of it for around 2-3 hours, and then it\"s going to get boring before you\"ve even seen how the game plays in standard mode. (if you find SpyParty very enjoyable casually, you do you)\nThis is actually what happened to me with the game in the summer of last year. I played it for a bit with a friend, he didn\"t like it too much and refunded it; and I kinda stopped playing after that, too, because I didn\"t see it as a game with any kind of depth to it, too.\n\nThen I came back to it in February, wanting to explore the game with a more competitive mindset. I gave it a shot (ha, see what I did there), put some effort into it, climbed the first slope of the learning curve and I had (and still have) a bloody great time with it.\n\n\nThe community:\n\nSo, basically, this game has the best community I have ever seen in a game, series, club or anthing else, period.\nIf you have a question regarding spyparty, there\"s always someone experienced there to help you out. People are incredibly friendly and just cool to hang out with in general. Toxic behaviour is not tolerated, neither in game, nor in the discord itself, where most of the community stuff takes place (at discord.gg/spyparty).\nThere are a lot of competitive events organized by the community, for example the current 6th season of the Spyparty Competitive League (SCL) is currently underway, casts, which are self-organized as well can be found on twitch and youtube. (twitch.tv/spyparty, respectively twitch.tv/spypartyfans and youtube.com/user/SpyPartyGame)\n\nThe topic of early access:\n\nThis game is in early access. It does NOT have any major bugs, it is visually polished freaturing a great timeless art style and it has enough depth and replayability to put every other game I know of to shame.\nIt is in early access, because the developer (yes, you heard that correctly, *the* developer, also known as Chris Hecker), has decided to continuously improve on the idea and add to the game since the first time showing it at PAX in 2010.\nThe one feature you might want as a new player that is not yet implemented is a matchmaking queue, right now the matches are found by hanging out in an in-game lobby, more about that in the next paragraph.\nThe matchmaking patch is going to be live soon, and I will amend my review on this once it hits.\n\n\nThe Lobby:\n\nEven without matchmaking, the wait time to find a game is usually below 2-3 minutes, especially during evenings in NA or EU.\nIf you take part in the discord though, you will have no major problems finding a game when asking there anyway, so either way, the missing matchmaking has never been a big problem for me.\n\nFinding matches against similarly strong opponents when starting out, on the other hand, can be a bit harder. There are also still new players coming into the game on a regular basis, though you can also play against stronger opponents enjoyably, due to the built-in handicap option, which selects the mission and guest count, as well as the time available to the spy approriately, depending on the gamecount of the players.\nIn conclusion, if you are fine with playing a stronger person on occasion, you will find matches reliably and quickly (these matches can be a great opportunity to learn new stuff about the game anyway ;) ).\n\n\nThe pricing:\n\nHere the difference in mentality really matters, if you see it as a party game for a few hours it is grossly overpriced. But that\"s exactly the point, it isn\"t just a party game, and if you are able to see spyparty for what it is - an incredibly competitive game about behaviour and awareness, in which memory, concentration, experience and mechanical execution are important, and which has a skill ceiling that no-one has even remotely seen yet - the price tag is absolutely reasonable.\nI\"d buy this game for the asking price of a usual "AAA"-game at 50-60€.\n\n\nThe tl;dr:\n\nIf you still are convinced that this is a party game, or you want to play it as such, then I can\"t fullheartedly recommend it to you, but this is only because it\"s not a party game and it\"s neither balanced, supported, nor priced as such.\n\nIf you are considering buying this because you want to play an interesting, deep, competitive game about behaviour which is incredibly fun to play with a great community, BUY IT.

{"id": "70346063", "review": "Spyparty can be played both casually and competitively. I agree, the cost of £20 is steep for a game that many people will only play a few times, but you have to be willing to play it enough to really understand what this game is about to make it feel worth £20.\nIt becomes worth the money (and worth every penny) once you move onto to intermediate play. Here it becomes less of a party game and more of a competitive 1v1 game. As spy you have to be deceptive, blend in and creative in order to complete missions against more competent snipers. As sniper, it"s very much a test of memory, as well as distinguishing human behaviour from AI behaviour. \nThere is so much to learn about how humans behave vs how AI behave, and it is a very psychological game once you get to know the playstyle of your opponent.\nThe community is extremely kind, and also quite small at the time of writing this. Experienced players are always open to teaching new players the basics, and the community is general is the least toxic I"ve ever been a part of.\nTo summarise, this game appeals heavily to intellectuals, those interested in human behaviour, and those who like memory puzzles. If you and a friend are thinking about buying this as a party game to play only a few times -  you probably think £20/$25 is too expensive, and you"re probably right - although saying this, I originally bought this game to play with a friend, and then I started learning how the game works more and more and eventually found myself playing competitively.", "game_id": "329070"}

I love being both sniper and spy and the current characters that have a fully developed model look great! It"s a diverse cast that"s crazy enough to work. I also love the different kind of maps and the way that art style looks. A thumbs up for the art team! \n\nI"ve not regretted paying this price. That said, it is higher than what I am used to with early access games and I do think that throwing it on a sale, even for like 15,99 or something would help the playerbase. But perhaps that"s simply not the goal for now. \n\nI am only a new player so I have no idea how quick updates come or how they will be scheduled but considering this game is in development for a long time so I can only assume the 1.0 version will be a way off.

A game shouldn\"t need a discord community in order to play. I also think the paywall is a bit high for the quality of content, which discourages a potentially large player-base. Just be aware that if you buy this game expecting to play right away you will be disappointed. You might end up sitting in the lobby all evening before you can get a game going.

So come and join this community! It"s a super nice community with a record so clean you can eat on it (if the record was on a paper). You can also go to the official discord and find games even faster! Did I mention the community was super nice already?\nOne thing though, the game does NOT have very regular updates and has some every 3 months on average, this is because there is basically only 1 person working on the game (Chris Hecker, also more commonly known as Checker) but the updates are pure gold. One last thing, if you do buy the game, please, please, please! Play the tutorial before going into a game, not only is the tutorial great but if you don"t play the tutorial, you won"t understand a thing of what you"re doing when playing with someone else, even if that person never played as well. You"re not going to have fun, the other person won"t have fun because they"re always winning and you"re not learning much because you don"t understand a thing of what is happening. So just play the tutorial before playing online, for your sake and all of ours.\n\nFor the original review:\nI spent 46 hours when I write this and this will keep going up, this game is one of the best games I have ever played, you need to try and read the mind of the sniper when you"re spy and guess where he is looking, as sniper, you need to keep track of a lot of things and for me that"s very entertaining. People can say it"s too much money, who would pay 25 dollars for this kind of game? Well I can tell you that I am very happy with this purchase. Some reviews also say that there are not enough players and they don"t receive an invite for 1 hour, I disagree totally, the best time for you to go is between 8pm and 2am gmt time and you"ll for sure find players, even not at these times, you"ll probably find a player after only 10 min maximum, even less if you have discord. If you do have discord, there are tournaments you can participate in and they will teach you everything you need to know about the game and you can chat with Chris Hecker (the one who developed the game) and talk about the future of the game and if you look at the news you see that he is always working on the game.\n\ntl;dr This is the best purchase I have made for a video game in a long time.", "game_id": "329070"}

I am unable to see any way to gain experience or skill at the game to actually start getting wins as a spy, but even then regardless I can"t even play the game for 10 minutes without feeling like I"m about to have a heart attack, and I"m the kind of person who never has that issue with games, so why this game in particular has that effect, especially so soon, I just can"t understand. And when playing as sniper, I find it incredibly easy because I always end up just watching a spy at the edge of the scope with the laser pointed somewhere else and they will do basically anything thinking that I"m simply not looking. It feels like by far the most unbalanced thing I have ever seen, and playing only as sniper gets boring extremely quickly, and feels like I"m locking myself out of half of the entire game.

I haven\"t seen any new updates for the past 2 years.\nA: Yes it is, however there is no current timeline for when future updates will be released.\n\nQ: Will the game go on sale soon? $25 is a bit much to convince friends to get the game with me.\nA: Currently, the dev\"s response is that there won\"t be a sale soon. Quote from dev on reasoning: "...the new user experience is still too rough.  Sales bring in a bunch of new players, including new players who are ever-so-slightly less interested in putting in effort to overcome bad UI or poor early game onramping, both of which SpyParty has in spades, and so it’d be a waste to put it on sale before I fix that stuff because a lot of folks who might like SpyParty if that stuff was fixed would just bounce off it.  Better to wait until it’s smoother for them.  I realize this philosophy temporarily screws over folks who are super motivated to learn the game and are just short on money, and I’m sorry for that, but I think on balance it’s the right thing for the game and community in the long run."\n\nIn the future, the dev plans to allow "spawn copies," which allows people who own the game to play versus friends who don\"t own the game.\n\nQ: Should I get the game?\nA: I think if you\"re in one of these two scenarios, you should definitely get it. The first being you have a friend who also will buy the game so you can play against each other. It will be fun obviously since you\"re playing with a friend, but it will also be ideal in terms of skill level. The second scenario is that you\"ve seen the competitive casts on Youtube or Twitch and you are interested in joining in the comp scene. The community is incredible and VERY dedicated at running competitions/casts year round which contributes to why game is still very much active despite not receiving a major game update since November 2019 with the addition of the Redwoods venue.\n\nIf you aren\"t in one of these two scenarios, I would personally recommend wishlisting it for now and checking back when more features like matchmaking or spawn copies are added. But if you\"re still eager to play then please do join us, the community is very welcoming and the discord can help with mentoring if you have the patience to learn playing against a higher skilled player.", "game_id": "329070"}

It"s a pretty good game, but it shouldn"t cost this much. Normally, I wouldn"t review a game based on it being too expensive, but in this case I think it directly impacts the gameplay - because the pricepoint is high enough that it is locking out a lot of players, most of the people you find in the lobby are going to be very dedicated players with hundreds or thousands of hours under their belt. The manual itself indicates that this is a problem for SpyParty. Often, I will solve issues with matchmaking in this type of game by buying copies for my friends, but $25 is just way too high for that.\n\nSo that"s why I have to give this a thumbs down. If you come to this game brand new, you will probably not have an amazing time. There are threads on the forums here where people say this can be resolved by joining a SpyParty discord server, but I don"t consider that an acceptable method of matchmaking for something at this pricepoint.", "game_id": "329070"}

{"id": "44844479", "review": "Not worth the asking price, maybe if it was for a two pack it would be more reasonable. Another option would a free client that allows you to connect and play only with people who have purchased the game. As it stands its very hard to find players the times I have been online players have been in the single digits.\n\nThe game has depth and is pretty fun but very limited in variation. It basically requires being on voice communication with a friend or it is unplayable as the lobby system currently is straight outta the early 90s and has no one really in it ever. There are different maps and customizable objectives but there is essentially only one game mode where one person plays as a spy trying to complete objectives and another person has to identify and stop the spy.\n\nI"d really like to see some more features and development in a direction that would both expand the community and offer more value for the steep asking price.\n\nSome possible ideas:\n\nIntegrate support for more then 1v1 gameplay. The easiest to implement would just allow x number of snipers vs the 1 spy. \n\nPerhaps there are multiple spies working together to try and complete more objectives. Maybe there could be a 1v1v1 gameplay mode where the spies race to complete x objectives first. Maybe there is both a sniper and an agent at the party with creative ways to eliminate the spy.\n\n However it is done there needs to be support for more than 1v1 gameplay so all 5 of the people in the lobby can play together if they choose. \n\nLocal play via the sniper using a smartphone/tablet \n\nBuilt in VOIP!!!\n\nThere are tons of option but expanding the functionality of what is essentially a strong party game should be a huge priority. I could see this game being much more succesful both in sales volume and word of mouth press with something like a 4 pack for 50 dollars if game modes that allowed at least 4 people to play together. This would also allow newer and solo players to join games with people with more experience with some of the depth the game has to offer beacuse currently it can be an extremly underwhelming experience as a solo player.\n\ngood luck homie", "game_id": "329070"}

And only 6 people were in the lobby. \n\nI cannot recommend anyone purchasing this game for $25 and not even be able to play it because there is nobody to play with in the first place. Check my public profile photos for evidence.\n\nSad really.\n\nOriginal Review:\nThis review is both an important suggestion to the developer and also a review of the game.\n\nThis is a great game with a very unique concept not seen anywhere else. This is something I know for a fact every one of my friends who even remotely touch games would like to try. However, when you compare this game to other games at the $25 price point, this game is definitely not up to par. This is DEFINITELY not to say that this game is inferior or less fun than other games out there. SImply put, the amount of content being provided is only worth $10, especially because everything about this game seems to be worked on by a single person(Same voice actor for the tutorial, the same voice actor for the sound effects in the game, slipshod lobbyroom, etc.)\n\nAt most, there are only 20 people in the lobby at once, a very sad sight, because my hope would be for this game to have bigger traffic. Seriously, their discord page is also a desert. This is in my honest and educated opinion; as a result of the high price point being put forward, it is really pushing people away from this awesome game. I would love to show this game and convince my friends to buy spyparty, but unfortunately I know for a fact that the response would be - "25 dollars??? eh..."\n\nI strongly believe that this game needs to be put forward at $10, and then remarketted into media sources. Ie, free copys to big youtubers such as pewdiepie, markiplier, etc. \n\nIn fact, videogamedunkey has already made a video of this game and his video has 2.5m views! You would think after that the game would hit off and people would start purchasing it, yet as mentioned before, the playerbase is only 20 people!!! I believe this clearly shows how much the pricetag is dissuading people from making a purchase.\n\nI hope you can see this message developer. I\"m sure that you take a lot of pride in your work and view this game as your life\"s work and artpiece. However, decreasing a games price does NOT mean it is a lesser game.

While the gameplay is already really good, there\"s no matchmaking or handicap system yet, so you have to be willing to wait around in lobby for a game and then put up with a "teaching game" from a much stronger player. The community is really good, though, so if you ask on the Discord it\"s much easier to get a game - and there are frequent competitive tournaments and a semi-official league, which make up for the lack of matchmaking.\n\nJust be sure to do the tutorial, and then give "beginner" mode a miss. It\"s a super shallow substitute for the real game that you\"ll tire of after two or three rounds, once you realise you can just camp one mission in that mode. It looks like some reviewers with low playtime have only been playing beginner mode and haven\"t even tried the full game.", "game_id": "329070"}

{"id": "43982111", "review": "I now have around 600 Matches of Spyparty played. I was watching some videos about it before and at first the price really scared me away. But then, I bought it anyway and I can really say that, by a simple Funtime/Money ratio, this game is absolutely worth the money. Here are some reasons why:\n\n- It is unique in it\"s gameplay. I\"ve never played a game before where you have to try to be as AI-like as you can. \n- It is a really tense experience. The time when you are putting a book away in the wrong bookshelf and seeing the laser coming towards you and expecting the shot but they just go on and you can live for another minute is just AWESOME!\n- It is really fun watching other people play. Besides all the people who stream Spyparty there are a lot of great commented casts of the competitive leagues.\n- The community is one of the friendliest I have ever seen in a game. I personally don\"t like playing online games that much with strangers because of the, well, internet. But here, especially the most succesfull and experienced players, the people are friendly and really want everyone to have fun with the game, explaining little details and features of the game. \n\nNow, besides all these awesome Things there might be some things you could struggle with in your first hours with Spyparty.\n- The lobby is really ugly and there is no matchmaking system YET. But I never had to wait more then 10 minutes before someone showed up to play with. The game has sound cues if something happens in the lobby so you can happily have the game minimized while doing other stuff and waiting for people coming to the lobby.\n- The first games can be quite hard, especially against a experienced player. I suggest leaving the "beginner" dificulty as early as possible. Don\"t get frustrated if you get shot! Losing is an integral part of the game, basically.\n- One can only learn playing this game when talking ot the opponent. A little "hi" in the beginning helps a lot and it\"s just more fun when you can discuss a match with your opponent after you have been shot "Oh, I didn\"t see that! I just thought you moved weird" \n- The game has a lot to offer which sometimes can\"t be seen in the first "difficulty" stages. Again, try to leave "beginner" as early as possible. If you don\"t mind being a little overwhelmed by possibilites, just go to "standard" really quick.\n\nSo, I REALLY suggest, you go to the official twitchpage of SpyParty and look at some of the commented plays there. They give you a feeling what the game has to offer, what kind of game it is and if it is for you. I\"m just saying: Do not NOT buy it, because someone said it is a "minigame" after playing it for 90 Minutes. Because it is really not a minigame. There is so much in this game and I haven\"t even scrapped the surface.", "game_id": "329070"}

For 25 dollars, you are getting a mini-game that takes 5+ mins to find players for, unless you have friends who also own the game. Unfortunately, when you price a game at 25 dollars, it"s hard to convince friends to play. I would avoid writing this review if the Devs gave it some thought, but they have repeatedly stated that they will keep the price tag, and maybe even increase it once out of Early Access.

{"id": "43472667", "review": "Okay, if you"re reading this, you"re off to a good start already. \n\nI want to start off by saying this is quite possibly THE best game I have ever played. It is very simple, but at the same time has so many hidden depths, you never really stop learning. When you lose, most of the time you can either already know why, or you LEARN why, and adjust for it. There are players with tens of thousands of games played, and they will tell you they are still learning as they play. It is unbelievably complex. It"s NOT a party game as some people say, it is probably closer to Chess. Seemingly simple, unbelievably in depth.\n\nBut here is the number one tip:\n\nAT THE VERY LEAST, PLAY THE TUTORIAL.\n\nThis game is HARD. It doesn"t matter how good you are at other video games, this one has got a HIGH barrier of entry. You will not understand what is happening. As the sniper, you won"t see a thing and still lose, and as the spy, you will get shot for reasons you haven"t even considered. There is a lot to learn, and whilst the game SEEMS simple, it is incredibly complex. If you dive into the deep end too quickly, or if you stay in the shallow end for too long, you won"t get the full experience of the game. Anyway, here is a quick rundown:\n\n- PLAY THE TUTORIAL. I cannot stress this enough, it"s a really good entry point and teaches you the basics.\n- BEGINNER MODE IS NOT THE FULL GAME. It"s not even HALF the full game. It"s probably closer to a quarter of the game, if that. There"s 8 total missions, and not only does beginner mode only have 4 of them, you don"t even have full versions of all the missions either. It"s also missing half the maps. That"s not to say it"s bad, it"s a VERY good entry point, but you will want to move through this one RELATIVELY quickly once you get the hang of things. If you are bored of the game but haven"t even gone past Beginner, that is why.\n- Intermediate is BETTER, giving you access to (I think?) every mission, but again, it"s not the full version of the missions you get in Standard. Intermediate is about half the game, and is good place to stay on if you"re still finding yourself overwhelmed as the Sniper, though it can bring bad habits if you stay on it too long.\n- Standard is where everything falls into place. Things like statue swapping, or purloining the guest list no longer point out who the Spy is, it just shows where the Spy has been... or they COULD still be there. Bugging the Ambassador can happen whilst moving, so are a lot harder to keep track of, and the Spy doesn"t necessarily need to talk to contact the double agent. It becomes a LOT more about mind games, trying to do things right under the Sniper"s nose, and making calculated risks.\n\nIt takes a while to get there, though, and if you"re not willing to put in the time (It honestly only takes half an hour every other day, it doesn"t need to be a game you play for 6 hours in one go!) then that"s ok! There"s just a lot of people who don"t realise what they"re signing up for, get overwhelmed, and wrongfully call it a bad game, or people who never switch off of Beginner and say the game is one dimensional.\n\nThis is not a game for everyone, but if it IS for you, you"ll stack up hundreds of games of it.\n\nAs one final point: The community is absolutely fantastic. They"re all very welcoming for new players, willing to teach you (if you"re willing to learn), and is diverse + welcoming to anyone. You can join the discord if you want to talk to players before you buy, or check out most twitch streams (as long as they"re not new players) and both the viewers + streamers will be willing to give you pointers here and there. We all love the game, and want to share it with other players, so don"t be afraid to ask questions, and scout it out before you buy.", "game_id": "329070"}

I\"ve already sunk over 300 hours and played over 3,000 individual matches. The game\"s depth seems bottomless, and even the veterans of the game who\"ve been playing for almost half a decade still learn new things constantly.\n\nSpyParty is truly the video game version of chess. Almost anyone can pick it up and play their friends competitively, but if you\"re to invest time into learning the complex strategies and mechanics of the game, you can start to dive into the mastery of it, that even the top players claim they haven\"t achieved.\n\n[h1] "SpyParty isn\"t for everyone" [/h1]\nSpyParty isn\"t for everyone. The developer has purposely chosen the price of the game as to reflect the premium that comes with the depth/replayability of this title (which has been in development since 2009). This, in turn, encourages a smaller, more dedicated community. If you\"re looking for an arcade-like game to play a couple of times with a friend, you might be better finding something else, as the price tag will likely be too high. Too many new players either watch or try the "Beginner vs. Beginner" mode (which has 4 missions and 4 maps), and never move on to the standard version of the game (currently titled \"Experienced\")\n\nIt\"s also mainly a one-man project. Developer Chris Hecker seems to be developing SpyParty primarily solo, and updates are few and far between. Could be a turning off point for many newcomers.\n\n[h1] A "1v1 game to master" [/h1]\nHowever, if you\"re looking for a truly competitive 1v1 game to master, with one of the friendliest, mature and most willing to educate communities I\"ve come across in my time of gaming, then consider giving SpyParty a try.\n\nThis game will take you as far as you\"re willing to go with it.

Parece um jogo simples, mas jogando você descobrirá várias camadas de complexidade que deixam a jogatina tensa, porém super divertida.\n\nJogando de espião, você está no meio de outros personagens controlados pela IA, e precisa agir que nem eles, enquanto completa várias missões. Trocar uma estátua, ou contatar o agente secreto, em um limite de tempo, e sem deixar o sniper descobrir seu disfarce. A cada segundo que passa a partida fica mais tensa - você pode olhar o relógio para adicionar mais tempo, mas e se o sniper perceber? Você pode fingir que está contatando o agente secreto para enganar o sniper e tirar a suspeita dos seus ombros, mas e se não funcionar? São riscos que você tem que correr para ganhar, mas que deixam o jogo divertido, sem ser muito frustrante. Cada partida é uma aprendizagem, e na próxima você já irá notar que estará melhor no jogo.\n\nJogando de sniper, você vê 10 ou 20 pessoas diferentes na sua frente, e pode achar que será muito difícil achar o espião, mas prestando atenção e marcando quem é ou não é suspeito, dentro do limite de tempo, você consegue achá-lo. Se você ouvir "banana bread", o espião está chamando um agente secreto, então você pode marcar todos que estão perto de um agente secreto como suspeitos... ou será que ele está só fingindo? Você só tem uma chance, uma bala para acertar o espião, então um erro significa game over.\n\nO jogo ainda não tem matchmaking, e não está em português, mas vale a pena jogar, mesmo pelo preço de 47 temers.

Никаких намеков на хорошую детализацию или сколько-нибудь качественную анимацию, интерфейс корявый. \n\nЗвук также...ни о чем...и большего не сказать.\n\n[h1]Геймплей:[/h1]\n\nИтак...по порядку...\n\nЕсть шпион, задача которого выполнить определенный перечень действий.\n\nИ снайпер, который должен эти действия заметить и шпиона устранить.\n\nШпион - более сложная роль, ибо любой промах в действиях под взглядом снайпера дает последнему намек на цель для стрельбы. \n\nНа текущий момент задачи построены так, что бдительный снайпер очень легко найдёт шпиона. Так выполняя "подмену статуэтки", снайперу достаточно запомнить форму оных. \nПри "связи с двойным агентом" проигрывается очень громкий звук, что сразу позволяет отфильтровать нпц, не стоящих в разговоре. \nПовесить "жучок" на посла возможно только с очень заметной анимацией.\nТолько "процесс очарования" не так очевиден.\n\nДобавьте сюда ограничение по времени для шпиона и видимый способ пополнения таймера миссии - вуаля, хардкорный симулятор закоса под непись готов.\n\nСнайпер же более прозаичен... перемещаясь по границе карты и издалека наблюдая за проводимым светским приемом ему следует внимательно высматривать подозрительное поведение гостей...помечая подозрительных и исключая "нормальных", ибо выстрел лишь один и права на ошибку нет. Впрочем основную помощь в поиске шпиона будут играть его задачи, заставляющие так или иначе раскрыться.\n\nИменно это жесткое противостояние тактики и внимательности являются основой игры, которая иногда создает удивительный накал страстей...играя шпионом можно получить немало адреналина, а снайперу насладиться своеобразным охотничьим азартом.\n\nНо увы...интерес к игре держится не так долго...Не к чему стремиться и поэтому на данный момент, чтобы получить от игры максимум - советую играть с другом.\n\n[h1]Итог:[/h1]\n\nХороший концепт, острые ощущения соперничества, но пока еще сырая реализация. \n\nДа и к цене вопрос...за эти же деньги есть тайтлы уже готовые и намного лучше.\n\nОценка 6.5 из 10.

The Spy trying to blend into the AI and complete his tasks (which is often quite tense and challenging) and The Sniper, tying to spot out the spy. With multiple objectives, varying difficulties and learning new methods/strategies, this game has a lot going for it. \nThis is my favourite game to play for short burts as a game tends to last ~5min if not less. \nThe community is also very kind, I often have pleasant interactions through the text chat ingame, talking about how we discoverd each other and discussing different strategies. \nPeople have complained about the price and I can understand their complaints if they choose to not invest too much time into learning the game and stick to only the beginner difficulty. This game really starts to open up at Intermediate and greater. \n\nSpy Party offers a ton of replayability and enjoyment that I"m sure to continue to get my money"s worth.", "game_id": "329070"}
{"id": "41726597", "review": "完整测评地址:https://steamcn.com/t382124-1-1\n\n游戏的测评及总结：\n游戏的整体性：\n        这款游戏注重的是双方的技术和心理上“博弈”，是选择“敌不动，我不动”这样以静制动的方式，什么也不做的等待敌方玩家先沉不住气露出马脚后将其击败；还是“此心妄动，随性而动”，各种出言挑衅对方，给对方心理和生理上双重施压，使对方按奈不住暴露出破绽；又或是“借刀杀人”使用各种假动作来迷惑对手，陷害NPC，然后取得游戏的胜利。这些多变且多样的玩法都是可以由玩家自己来决定和选择，而且根据游戏的练习模式中，查看角色动作中可以发现，未来游戏还会拥有更多的玩法，比如更多迷惑狙击手和嫁祸NPC的方式来丰富游戏体验。但目前游戏的玩法变化和套路还是略显单一，各种NPC的行为模式也有迹可循（有些行为NPC和玩家的区别还是比较明显的），在线游戏的人数并不是特别多（可能我多数都是在晚上玩的）。不过目前游戏的游玩环境特别的好，我在游戏中遇到了很多十分友善的外国友人，他们会为新手玩家主动提供帮助，解答新人玩家对这个游戏提出的问题，我甚至还在游戏中交到了一个法国友人。（这环境真的棒，我已经很久没有在游戏中感受到这种的温暖了）。此游戏的问题还有目前游戏开发的进度问题，因为这是个独立游戏，而且制作组也只是个不到10个人小团队，这就造成的开发进程十分的缓慢，不过也可以看出游戏的制作者对这款游戏有多用心（相信可以从他们做了9年都没做完的这种精益求精的精神中感受的出来）。此外，这款游戏还是一个需要玩家花费足够多的游戏时间反复熟悉AI的行为和动作以便更好的融入或者识别出真正的AI，因为某些游戏的操作缘故会让你在一群AI中显得十分的突兀，比如一直站着不动，或者是长时间的待在某个地方，玩家需要尽量的保持移动自己，还有我觉得游戏中AI的行为和动作应该不仅是局限于重复的在执行玩家的任务范围里来回的走动，应该在游戏的过程中做些随机的动作或者其他行为，以及给每个人物一些鲜明的特性，比如某个角色可以更快的色诱某些角色.....等等之类的，让玩家更好加深对于角色的印象以便代入其中。\n\n游戏的画面及音乐:\n       这款游戏的画面总的来说并不是特别好，相比其他独立游戏可以说是差强人意，甚至是粗糙。人物建模，还可圈可点，很好的描绘各种肤色各种穿着光鲜亮丽的上流社会的精英人士共聚一堂的景象，不过人物之间的特色并不是特别的明显，除了只有一个特别矮小的人物，可以更好依靠矮小的身材把周边的人和建筑作为掩体遮挡狙击手的视线，其他人物感觉就是只是换了面貌和衣服并无任何的特色，还有就是游戏中人物碰撞时偶尔会有发生穿模的现象。游戏的音乐和音效，游戏中基本没有什么音乐，音效倒是很好的刻画了一个聚会中各种人物谈论的吵杂的环境，“导致我一开始还以为是进入了一个菜市场”，游戏其他一些音效也十分简陋。比如狙击手射出子弹的“biu“的枪声。\n\n游戏的剧情和成就：\n      目前游戏中还未有任何的剧情和成就（之后会不会加入就不晓得了）\n\n游戏评分：\n         \n          加分项\n       +独特的风格\n       +技术与心理双重考验\n       +简单的操作\n         \n          减分项\n        -游戏模式单一\n        -游戏画面和音效略为简陋\n        -没中文\n        -售价略贵\n      \n         评分：6/10（有趣的游戏，值得一试）\n\n游戏的总结：\n      这款游戏容量只有区区的300多M，但蕴含着的却是超高的游戏性和特别的风格，不同于“三国杀”和“狼人杀”这类同样是心理游戏而且可以容纳更多人一起游玩，这款游戏的一局比赛从头到尾都只有2个玩家，游戏中影响玩家判断的元素却不仅仅只有玩家本身，比如作为间谍，你会时刻处在一种被监视的环境下（或者玩家认为自己现在正处在被监视的环境中），这款玩家更多是在跟自己的心理和自己的决策做斗争，比起其他心理游戏这款游戏也更能直观的看到玩家的行为，我撰写本次测评时短短15小时的游戏时间仅仅也只是接触到了这款游戏的皮毛，这款游戏还是具有他独特的魅力和无限的可能。（就是售价贵了点）\n\n", "game_id": "329070"}

{"id": "41652662", "review": "As someone who enjoys the multiplayer of Assassin’s Creed, SpyParty’s central conceit has appealed to me immediately. This week, I finally got to try the tutorial and one online game and it did not disappoint. With all the moving parts in SpyParty, I was worried about how long it’d take me to learn the its nuances – I knew I wouldn’t be good immediately, but I at least wanted to understand what others were doing to make them good. The tutorial did a great job of this. Chris Hecker himself narrates it and walks you through the facilities and strategies of both the Sniper and Spy.\n\nAs the Spy, you are trying to complete objectives in a time limit without getting caught. Each of the objectives will expose you to some degree – swapping a statue is particularly risky because the Sniper can memorize the statue placement in advance. As a Sniper, you’re looking for these tells with the ability to “lowlight” or “highlight” guests based on your observations. When you’re sure, you can pull the trigger.\n\nGetting through the tutorial gave me the false sense of confidence I needed to dive right in to online multiplayer. I lost in short order but knew exactly why and this is SpyParty’s biggest boon. It’s immediately readable and relays complex information in understandable fashion, allowing the player to trust the game and eventually, their instincts. I can’t wait to dig in and lose some more.\n\n[quote]Courtesy of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32143389/]Notable Releases[/url] curator group\n\n[url=http://notablereleases.com/post/indie-weekly-2018w15/#spyparty]Full Review[/url][/quote]", "game_id": "329070"}

In general it is the perfect game to play 2-5 rounds now and then as pastime. Still right now I can"t really see me spending the time on several thousand rounds on this game like many of the veteran players already did but if the content updates on maps, characters and playmodes keep coming up as promised by the creator there will be a lot more to do in the future.\nVery promising and already now defenitely worth playing.\n\nFor all early access burned people: I know your pain, believe me. But even if this game stays in EA forever, you will have a blast. This game is very clearly the creator"s baby and he won"t let it die in the corner rather than feeding and caring for it until it is ready for adulthood.\n\nI want to address some of the negative reviews: Almost all of them mention the high price.

Gameplay wise it"s pretty unique and potentially has unlimited shelvelife if you are into the competitive aspect. I like the replay system where one can instantly check out moments from the just played game and hop straight back into continuing the game. Right now there is still an ugly lobby that while functional doesn"t really fit well within the rest of the game. Highly recommend playing someone your level/a friend.

{"id": "41620382", "review": "SUBTLE AND EXCITING AS THE SPY GENRE SHOULD BE\n\nSpy Party is a game built on a seemingly simple formula: one player is a spy hiding among AI civilians at a party, while the other player is a nearby sniper trying to spot him (and take him out).  The spy must complete a few missions at this party to win before a timer runs out, and must try to strike a balance between working toward his missions, and acting natural to throw off his would-be assassin.  The sniper can win by shooting the spy, of course, but also by keeping such close tabs on the party that there is no safe way for the spy to complete his missions before time runs out.  At the end of each round, the players switch sides between sniper and spy roles.  Matches continue for as many rounds as the players wish, and score is kept each round.\n\nControls in the game are very simple and can be learned in a few minutes by following the tutorial.  Advanced play benefits from a few optional mechanics that significantly enrich the game and improve balance.  These optional mechanics aren"t explained well in the tutorial, but when you"re ready to try them in your matches, you"ll find the community is suprisingly friendly and willing to help you learn.  Withing just a few games, you"ll feel comfortable playing with all the advanced rules, and you"ll have fun while learning.  To improve quickly, you can also watch replays of your matches, and spectate other players as they play.\n\nSpy Party was in early beta for several years before hitting Steam.  It shows.  As of Steam release, matchmaking and replays have a few minor bugs, but gameplay is highly polished.  The game isn"t demanding on hardware, and it is very forgiving of high latency connections.\n\nUltimately, Spy Party is a very different kind of PvP strategy game- unique but familiar, with nuance and complexity rarely found in strategy titles.  Highly recommended.", "game_id": "329070"}

{"id": "41614252", "review": "So I had it on my mind that I was going to write the best review this game had ever seen in my mind, and I intend to fullfill that desire in the best way that I can\n\nI will divide this into several parts, but just skip to the end if you find it too boring.\n\n(BTW, heads up... I was part of the Beta prior to Steam, that\"s why I said "I got the product for free", even though I paid for it, just not through Steam. I do have few hours through Steam, but over 500 or something through the Early Beta days)\n\nCONCEPT \n\nHoly shit, SpyParty has the best game concept I have seen... I\"m not joking. It\"s one of a kind, and I hope it remains to be one of a kind. The overall idea is that you want to mingle around a bunch of AI\"s while trying to do some missions, or, on the other hand, trying to shoot the player mingling... Sounds simple, right? Nope, it is not... \n\nThe concept is based off of a reverse of the Turing test. If you don\"t know, the Turing test was/is a way of a machine to reveal human behavior, so basically a test to see if AI could imitate human behavior. As some of you might have already understood, the reverse Turing test would be a human trying to imitate AI... Which sounds incredibly stupid, but works in the best way possible... \n\nThe concept, while being amazing, adds a sense of deepness to the game, where even though it\"s a bit repetitive, it never gets boring.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay is... a rollercoaster, I would say. It\"s hard to compare it to anything in this regard, but imagine this: while playing Spy, the laser goes over you, and suddenly your blood starts to rush, as you suspect you\"re about to get shot... and then the laser continues to move; as the Sniper, everything seems confusing and paranoia is a constant: Was that a bug? Did the timer go up?\n\nIt\"s simple and yet deep? There\"s no way to explain it but to play it. In a way, it is simple because the goal is clear... And yet, it is deep, for I, a player with over 3.2 k rounds in this game, still continue to learn new things every day... It proves to be a hell of a ride.\n\nAI \n\nThe AI do SO MUCH stuff... And I mean so much. Picking up statues, books, briefcases, drinks, talking, checking their watches... Am I forgetting something? Oh yeah, they walk.. And they walk a lot... You\"ll get paranoid.\n\nThe AI do have specific things they do, but at the same time, there are only a few bugs that can make you rule out those AI\"s, and even if you\"re the spy, you can\"t honestly be mad, since one lowlight out of 13 guests is nothing, right?\n\nThey are weird, though. Chris has given them so much freedom, and this freedom happens to make the game way funnier, with animation weirdness and some things that will just make you get an adrenaline rush.\n\nREPLAY SYSTEM\n\nHoly hell, is the replay system amazing. 6 camera angles at your disposal, automatic file saving to be watched later, and even the opportunity to play Sniper against the Spy on the replay!!!! \n\nSome people have seen Chris\" enthusiasm and said "No, this game will never make it to E-Sports", but it has, and the replay system is truly what makes it so special for people like us, that just watch it on Twitch or even in the game itself. \n\nAnd also, watching a replay is always good after you finish the match, to see what you might\"ve missed or how things looked for the Sniper... \n\nOf course, other thing I also love is to save specific files with the name of "MissShots" or "To Practice Sniper", in specific folders.\n\nART\n\nOk, the art is amazing. Most people agree on this "The art is amazing" and honestly, I can\"t disagree... It fits the game\"s theme while remaining timeless, even though I suspect that everything happens in the past, and not in the present nor in the future... \n\nHowever, if you look hard enough, you will see elements of the old art... Mannequins roaming around, with uncostumizable animations... I remember those days...\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nI feel like there is no much to say, other than the color pallette of this is amazing and I love the diversity\n\nMISSIONS\n\nThey make the game great... You have missions you can camp, and missions you need to watch closely for... Soft and hard tells... Missions a spy almost always does, and missions you can only shoot if you\"re lucky... Even though I do feel like there should be more missions (Chris is working on it of course), they, for now, are enough and balanced.\n\nMAPS\n\nGreat variety of maps... There are only 10, but it\"s amazing how the map can manipulate the game... Maps like Balcony can be so directed to the Sniper, while you can roam freely as the Spy on Libray or Veranda... The available missions shift with these, and it ends up being amazing.\n\nMODES\n\nModes are a bit... bad, to be honest... I understand the need for there to be a beginner side of things, but I do feel like the Intermediate mode is a bit unbalanced towards the Spy, that only needs to do 3 missions in 4 minutes? \n\nSome people think Beginner is unbalanced because you can just camp the statues, but honestly, it\"s supposed to be beginner. The sniper will eventually realise this, and so people move on to Intermediate, where I feel like they are left out on a lot: Action tests; walking bugs; delegates; next person swaps; framing; briefcase; etc....\n\nExperienced mode comes in out of nowhere, and kind of opens a lot of possibilites, leaving new players stomped.\n\nTUTORIAL\n\nRelated to the previous point, the tutorial never speaks about Action tests or important stuff... I kinda feel like it needs some improving...\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\nOMG, if this isn\"t the best community in the gaming industry, then holy heck. Everyone is friendly. It\"s toxicity-free.. No joke... The veterans try to help out the new players, and always share tips, and even if you want to talk about non-related game stuff, we\"re always here for you. \n\nOf course this is something that may change, and I\"m nervous about it with the Steam release and everything, but hopefully you\"ll stay friendly and Chris nominates some moderators to ban people.\n\nAlso, please talk if you come to the game. There is nothing worse than having an opponent who refuses to explain their actions and learn from their mistakes.\n\nUI\n\nUI needs some improving, I feel like that is something a lot of people agree with... New players have a hard time figuring out how to go to Intermediate, and the lobby looks a bit ugly..... Inviting is something that they are also confused about, and I feel like it needs a bit of a brush-up...\n\nIN GENERAL\n\nPeople do complain a bit about the price, but I happen to disagree. See, SpyParty is not for everyone, I will admit it. You have to actually think if you want this or not. The skill curve is super steep, and you will get some stomp matches, but as long as you keep an open head, you will be good. And this sense of deepness totally justifies its price. For those that disagree, try playing the game more. Maybe you\"ll understand...\n\nTLDR\n\nPROS\nGreat Concept\nAmazing Gameplay\nHilarious and Tricky AI\nGorgeous Art\nDiverse Characters\nSense of Complexity\nGreat Replay System\nDiverse and Yet Familiar Missions\nSeveral Different Maps That Change Everything\nThe Best Community\nSurprinsigly Cheap for What It Is\n\nCONS\nBad UI\nUnbalanced Modes\nLack of Information on Tutorial\n\n\nOverall, definitely get it if you are in for a learning experience, awesome community, and some Banana Bread!!!!", "game_id": "329070"}

{"id": "41592993", "review": "Great fun! The gameplay seems simple at first but the strategies you use to win are diverse.\n\nThe variety of the results is great: no two rounds end the same. Sometimes you will be playing as the spy and give yourself up right away. Other times it will be a nail biter and you will have to juggle wondering if the spy is almost done with their missions and how much time you have left to gather more evidence.\n\nThe maps all have different feels to playing them. Playing a game on cramped map is different that the ones that consist of many corners in which to hide.\n\nThis game is great for short or long game sessions as well. You can end up playing a few rounds in 20 minutes, depending on how long they go.\n\nThe community seems strong as well.

I\"ve been playing since the early beta days around 2012 and can safely state the following: 1) the game is fun and engaging even after many hours of play; 2) the community is great and very welcoming to new players; 3) don\"t get fooled by the "early access" tag, because this game is both very playable in its current state and has tons of hours of content. \n\nOne of my favorite features is the deep replay system where you can spectate previous matches AND live matches and thereby learn from other people as well as your own mistakes.

I played a couple games a year to watch the progress and I\"m really happy to see how this game has evolved.\n\nThe evolving meta between snipers and spies is really where this game shines.\n\n* Game 1: Spy goes straight for a statue swap, a microfilm transfer, and an ambassador bugging, winning the game.\n* Game 2: Sniper watches the only statues, catches the spy in the act, and wins.\n* Game 3: Spy goes for subtler missions ("soft tells") like seducing another guest, inspecting statues, and fingerprinting the ambassador, wins because the sniper was watching only for a swap the whole time.\n* Game 4: Sniper watches for guests moving around a lot, lowlighting guests that stay still for long stretches of time. Finds one that\"s moving a whole lot more than others. Snipes. Wins.\n* Game 5: Spy slows it down, spends time chilling in conversation circles, tries to throw off the scent...\n\nYou see where this goes. It\"s a back and forth between evenly matched players that grows over time. The only thing this game needs is ranked matchmaking. I have no doubt Chris will eventually get around to it... "soon". ;)\n\nEdit 3 years later:\n\nI _had_ said yes, but I\"m going to have to change my recommendation to a no. That matchmaking has been absent for so long and the community remains relatively small means that the only way you\"re going to enjoy this game is with a friend dedicated to learning alongside you.

SpyParty is pure genius and is deeply intricate which I"d say is where most people run into their first gripe. There should definitly be an updated better tutorial. I don"t buy reviews complaining about not being able to play ever. The lobby is yes; relatively small, but be a bit more patient. \n\nThere are plenty instances where you can simply play sniper as well, Sniping is the truly the most crucial skill of the game. Weeding out all the opponents instances of interaction with AI, while simultaneously carrying out your strategy to dissect the party is the challenge. It"s usually easier to get away with cheap wins being spy, sniper is no joke you degenerate. \n\nIt"s fun using chat at times as well, I like the primitive feel I hope it stays that way honestly. Every menu executes perfectly. Chat is crucial during rounds for each to fully master their mishaps.\n\nThe advantage of having the Spy being a relatively easy task to cheese, is each player gets their chance to learn through the sniper of the true nature of the party. The accuracy type task performing tests to hit green, red, or gray with clicking left is satisfying to master (Tests are only preformed while Spy). Each color performs a different effect depending on the task at hand. No matter your skill it"s likely new players pickup this skill quick which is gold. For example; if you switch a statue hitting green, it will appear to the sniper as if the next AI who picks up that same statue has done the statue swap. If you hit red a thump of metal is heard by the sniper.\n\nI understand it"s high price, it"s well worth that money but I understand getting two friends to buy it can be difficult at times.

The replay system also offers a sort of singleplayer experience because you can play sniper games against the replays of Spy games.

Features like these are fantastic and Chris Hecker is still working hard at making them even better.\n\nThat being said, the game is tiny. If you watch a video on YouTube, you will probably see most of what the game has to offer.

Like the pub for example, you can camp trophies until you notice it a swap. Theres only two of them and they\"re very easy to view. This an example of an area that needs tweaking.

Use papa danger and his cane; want to contact the double agent, want to swap statue and block the sniper"s view? Use Taft"s girth to block their view. Want to contact the double agent without being seen talking? Business woman takes several breaks during her talking animation, so just cancel talking without a jarring animation break. \n\nThis is one of my favorite games of all time. I put about about 40 hours into in the pre-steam beta. I"ve bounced off of other competitive games but SpyParty keeps me coming back because of the great community, and because it rewards dedication and study in a way many games don"t. I am still learning new techniques to avoid detection and manage my perception of everything going on at the party. This game teaches you to read others, and to understand yourself.\n\nThe game is laser-focused on social interactions; it"s a game where you can shoot someone for spending too much time with one guest , for talking out of turn, for being rude to the waiter; a game where you can win by framing another guest, by waiting patiently for the perfect opportunity, by blending in so thoroughly you feel like a self-actualized machine.", "game_id": "329070"}

{"id": "41523220", "review": "I"ve been playing SpyParty for years. When I first heard about it, I thought it was one of the most brilliant game concepts I ever heard of. I still believe that.\n\nAt a glance, this game seems like a one-trick pony. But it"s really not. This is a game of behavior, deception, and blending in, all while racing against the clock. And on the flip side, you have a game of reading subtle cues, behavior, and using your attention to its best efficiency.\n\nIf you"re someone who enjoys a game with a deep meta-game, SpyParty is the game for you. Once you start managing to divert the sniper"s attention with a fake attempt to contact the double agent to try a mission with a more obvious tell, you"ll cackle will glee as the sniper"s sight visibly becomes erratic trying to highlight and lowlight suspects - meanwhile, you swap a statue. Or you bug the ambassador. You"ll feel like you just took a risk and won big. Then you"ll feel like you can spend 30 seconds performing an action that will lower your profile. You"ll begin to realize the kind of amazing depth this game has.\n\nI bought this at $15, but even at $25, this is some of the best value you"ll ever get out of a video game if the style appeals to you. It"s even more fun with friends!\n\nIf you enjoy games like Town of Salem, Throne of Lies, Epic Mafia, Secret Hitler, etc, I strongly recommend this game.", "game_id": "329070"}

Not only is it truly unique and captivating but it"s executed excellently. I never knew how much fun it could be pretending to be an NPC! There"s nice variety in the missions too, with some much harder than others (this in itself lends to some interesting meta gameplay).\n\nThe "beginner mode" (which limits the missions and venues available) is actually quite hard for the spy, (I feel it"s more about teaching you how to be a sniper) but once you move through to the more complete game it becomes much more balanced and challening; as a sniper once you"re looking for any 4 of 7 missions being completed somewhere like the library then it becomes pretty overwhelming! It"s one of those rare, well balanced games where you feel at a disadvantage, no matter what side you"re on! Very thrilling gameplay considering how bland the activities :)\n\nA special mention for the community too, which is friendly and well natured. I"ve not even seen so much as a grumpy player, let alone a hostile one. Everyone is just having a great time.\n\nLove it, highly recommend it, and look forward to playing it for years to come!", "game_id": "329070"}

Probably the most unique multiplayer game I have played in awhile.\n\nOne player is the sniper (with only one bullet, so make your shot count!) and the other player is the spy (trying to do objectives and not get the snipers attention. Sounds simple, but the mind games and the gameplay is fantastic and a real rush. The game also has what might be one of the best communities I have come across in my 30+ years of gaming. So far EVERYONE has been nice and helpful to me as a new player, this is very rare in this day and age to see.\n\nOne game I had two people marked, I was 100% sure it was one of them. But I wasn"t sure which one! I also had the option of waiting for time to run out if I didn"t think he finished the objectives. So I took a chance and shot one of the two I had marked, it was the other one! At the end it shows that it was one of the guys i had marked BUT he didn"t even finish the missions! I could have just waited a few more seconds for the time to run out and I woudl have run! But I had this feeling like I had to take the shot, I knew it was one of them. What touch decisions!\n\nAnother time I beat a guy who had a bunch of wins within the first 10 seconds of me playing as sniper. What a rush! The other games we had where much closer and he probably took it easy on me a bit but boy, that early detective work as the sniper sure worked good and felt great. A game where you have to outsmart your opponent! Mind vs mind, instead of being more about how fast you can move or aim or shoot, people have to really think and be smart in this one. \n\nGames can play out in many different ways, I have only done about 15 games so far but I am already in love with this game. The game is also not finished yet! Can"t wait to see what gets added in the future to this wonderful and unique indie game that is fun vs random"s and vs friends. I woudl suggest checking out some twitch streams of the game, that go tme interested in the game and the ideas it brings to the table. Nice work devs and keep up the good work!\n\nNow let me get back to improving my spy work (I thought I was going to be so much better as spy, but I sure was wrong haha, I have had a few people say how good I am at sniper, even early on. It is also in pretty good shape to, other than a few bugs and a little lag in one game, it has been a wonderful experience and a game I will comeback to very often in the future (especially if some of my good friends pick this up. I can see some epic and funny gaming nights with friends on this game in the future lol). It is really nice to see a game take a unique stab at something new, especially with all these modern games copying something or other, trying to be the next big thing. Spy Party is good ol" fashioned fun! One of the best 1vs1 games I have ever played, it really makes you think differently than you are use to with most games.\n\nDear friends, can you please get this game?

That still blows my mind, but every time I play, there"s always something new I learn or something I know I can do better.\n\nI"ve seen people argue that the novelty will wear off, and they"re right.

The game has a steep learning curve for experienced mode, [i] and [/i] a high skill ceiling.

You"ll jump into a mode where you learn 4 missions and play other people with just about the same number of games and play. You"ll play until you kind of figure out what you"re playing and then your world expands; A LOT. You get access to 4 other missions and the sniper has to look for more. \n\nThe more you play, the more you realize you need to be like the AI to succeed. Yes, you need to do missions but it takes SOOO much skill to know how to be an AI and not get shot by the top players of this game. I have >9000 games played and it still doesn"t cease to teach me new things about the game each time I die.\n\nIf the time I spent in game were divided by the $30 I"ve spent on Spyparty, I"d be spending $0.05/24 hours. I think thats pretty good value. If you come online and ask a question, I do not doubt that you will get at least 3 answers trying to help you solve your issue. \n\nThough this game has been in production for a long time, updates are constantly coming out, and there are a lot of plans for what is still to come.

For now, be talkative, and treat each game as a learning experience.  Playing with someone more knowledgeable is the fastest way to learn!)\nThe new player experience isn"t solidified yet, it can be tough to know when to open yourself up to more advanced modes (This is a high priority for the dev, should be soon.  When the sniper starts winning most games, it"s a good time to move out of beginner, by looking at the dropdown in top middle of spy setup.

{"id": "41465777", "review": "Don\"t let the time played above this review decieve you, I have 100s of hours in this game before it hit Steam. Though it starts off relatively simple (and has a great tutorial to teach you the basics), you\"ll quickly find that the game goes very deep with mindgames and the "I knew that you knew that I knew that ...." logic bullet train.\n\nAccording to the stats, I\"ve played over 3600 games of this and I am still learning new things about this game (the top players have almost 20,000 games played). $25 is well worth it for this game: the game has 10 maps to play on and an _EXTENSIVE_ replay system for analyzing games. The replay system even still loads my replays from 2014 (looking at you PUBG that has constantly broken old replays). You can spectate live games and even practice sniper by sniping against a live game. This "early access" game has more polish than many full-release games I\"ve seen and the developer really, truly cares about feedback.\n\nSome tips for newbies:\n\n1) Don\"t be discouraged if you lose at the beginning. This game can be hard. Chatting with your opponent and reviewing the replay can teach you a TON.\n2) Ask questions in the game lobby! People are generally willing to help out and answer anything you need to know.\n3) Once the sniper begins to win around 100% of the time, it\"s time for you to move on to Intermediate mode which unlocks more missions. There\"s a little dropdown menu next to the map selector at the top of the Spy setup screen.\n\nHappy sniping (and/or spying)!", "game_id": "329070"}

The updates are... slow but consistent.\n-\tBest replay system in any game ever.\n-\tGreat combination of mindgames and technique. Insert dev’s poker/go analogy.\n-\tOne of the friendliest, nicest communities out there.\n-\tGame’s gorgeous.\nThe cons:\n-\tOnly one dev, who works really slowly. Don’t expects the updates very often; they ARE regular and consistent, but far inbetween. There’s a reason this game is taking so long. \n-\tThe game made it into Steam without some planned feature, as a result of the above.

Если играть за снайпера, то нужно постоянно следить за всем, анализировать ситуации, держать в голове различные игровые моменты, например где какие статуетки должны стоять (их может быть от 1 до 8), можно конечно не париться и надеятся на удачу, что увидишь своими глазами саму подмену, но лучше не стоит. \nШпион может неплохо отыгрывать бота и если он освоился в игре, то отличить его будет очень сложно от других. В зависимости от режима игры шпион должен выполнить определенное количество заданий, но его время ограничено, и если он будет не успевать, то ему придется рискнуть и перевести часы. Если снайпер заметит что время увеличилось и сможет верно предположить кто из стоящих у балкона или окна смотрел на часы, то шпион будет убит) Помимо этого есть еще масса других заданий которые нужно выполнять, присутствуют например режимы выполнить 3 из 5 заданий, ботов может быть много и всё это только усложняет игру снайперу, но шпионом играть тоже не легко. Нужно отлично отыгрывать обычного бота и незаметно выполнять задачи либо вовремя споймать момент и ввести снайпера в замешательство, после чего он убьет вообще не того и проиграет.
